N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used for preoperative language mapping, but it still suffers from comparatively high sensitivity and low specificity when compared to direct cortical stimulation (DCS). Therefore, this study evaluates whether the additional consideration of rTMS‐based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for identifying language‐positive brain regions improves specificity when compared to DCS. METHODS: We performed rTMS, rTMS‐based DTI FT, and DCS during awake surgery combined with object naming in 20 patients suffering from left‐sided perisylvian brain lesions. For rTMS, different error rate thresholds (ERTs) and error types were considered, and DTI FT was conducted with individualized fractional anisotropy thresholds (FATs). Then, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for rTMS vs. DCS, rTMS‐based DTI FT vs. DCS, and rTMS spots confirmed by rTMS‐based DTI FT vs. DCS were calculated. RESULTS: In general, rTMS vs. DCS was in good accordance with previous literature (sensitivity/specificity: 92.7/13.3 % for all naming errors without ERT). In addition, rTMS‐based DTI FT vs. DCS led to balanced results when tracking was based on all errors as well (sensitivity/specificity: 62.8/64.3 % for 100 % FAT). However, rTMS combined with rTMS‐based DTI FT vs. DCS did not lead to any improvement in specificity when compared to rTMS vs. DCS alone. CONCLUSION: The additional use of rTMS‐based DTI FT to rTMS did not improve the identification of DCS‐positive language areas during awake surgery. Yet, concerning rTMS‐based DTI FT, this new technique must be validated itself by intraoperative subcortical stimulation.

N2  -  Background: Efforts to resection of glioma lesions located in brain‐eloquent areas must balance the extent of resection (EOR) and functional preservation. Currently, intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) is the gold standard for achieving the maximum EOR while preserving as much functionality as possible. However, intraoperative DES inevitably involves risks of infection and epilepsy. The aim of this study was to verify the reliability of individual‐target transcranial magnetic stimulation (IT‐TMS) in preoperative mapping relative to DES and evaluate its effectiveness based on postsurgical outcomes. Methods: Sixteen language‐eloquent glioma patients were enrolled. Nine of them underwent preoperative nTMS mapping (n=9, nTMS group), and the other seven were assigned to the non‐nTMS group and did not undergo preoperative nTMS mapping (n=7). Before surgery, online IT‐TMS was performed during a language task in the nTMS group. Sites in the cortex at which this task was disturbed in three consecutive trials were recorded and regarded as positive and designated nTMS hotspots (HSnTMS). Both groups then underwent awake surgery and intraoperative DES mapping. DES hotspots (HSDES) were also determined in a manner analogous to HSnTMS. The spatial distribution of HSnTMS and HSDES in the nTMS group was recorded, registered in a single brain template, and compared. The center of gravity (CoG) of HSnTMS (HSnTMS‐CoG)‐based and HSDES‐CoG‐based diffusion tensor imaging‐fiber tracking (DTI‐FT) was performed. The electromagnetic simulation was conducted, and the values were then compared between the nTMS and DES groups, as were the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scale and fiber‐tracking values. Results: HSnTMS and HSDES showed similar distributions (mean distance 6.32 ± 2.6 mm, distance range 2.2‐9.3 mm, 95% CI 3.9‐8.7 mm). A higher fractional anisotropy (FA) value in nTMS mapping (P=0.0373) and an analogous fiber tract length (P=0.2290) were observed. A similar distribution of the electric field within the brain tissues induced by nTMS and DES was noted. Compared with the non‐nTMS group, the integration of nTMS led to a significant improvement in language performance (WAB scores averaging 78.4 in the nTMS group compared with 59.5 in the non‐nTMS group, P=0.0321 < 0.05) as well as in brain‐structure preservation (FA value, P=0.0156; tract length, P=0.0166). Conclusion: Preoperative IT‐TMS provides data equally crucial to DES and thus facilitates precise brain mapping and the preservation of linguistic function.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Gross total resection (GTR), defined as complete resection of enhancing tumour on post‐operative MRI, increases progression free survival (PFS) in patients with glioblastoma. We have extended the concept of functionally guided supramaximal resection (SMR) where the aim of surgery is to resect up to 2 cm beyond the enhancing tumour in all directions, limited only by functional boundaries. Boundaries are identified by pre‐operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, to estimate white matter fibre tract location, and awake craniotomy with cortical and subcortical stimulation. METHODS: Prospective non‐randomised functionally guided surgical resection was undertaken in all IDH‐wildtype glioblastomas undergoing primary surgical resection by the senior author between 2012‐2017. Based on post‐operative MRI scans, data on extent of tumour resection were analysed calculating tumour, brain and post resection volumes. Patients were then categorised into three different extent of resection groups: subtotal resection (STR), GTR, and SMR. All patients underwent post‐operative radiotherapy and chemotherapy as per the Stupp protocol and were followed up with 3‐monthly MRI scans. RESULTS: 69 cases of IDH‐wildtype glioblastoma underwent resection within the timeframe. Survival data are currently available for 45 cases. The outcome measure is PFS, where progression is defined as recurrence of tumour. For actual treatment received, median PFS was 43.9 months (95% CI, 22.8‐ 89.8 months) in the SMR group, 29.3 months (95% CI, 7.4‐72.3 months) in GTR group and 13.3 months (95% CI, 10.3‐27.6 months) in the STR group. The Kaplan‐Meier survival curves of the three groups are clearly separated with no crossing. The logrank test indicates there is a significant difference (P value = 0.0003) between the survival curves of the three groups. There was no difference in the incidence of post‐operative neurological deficit between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Supramaximal resection provides a significant increase in PFS compared to the current accepted standard of GTR.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in neuronavigation surgery of brain tumors involving pyramidal tracts. METHODS: Forty‐nine patients with brain tumors involving pyramidal tracts were randomly divided into trial group (DTI navigation) and control group (traditional navigation). The patients in trial group underwent DTI and T1 weighted 3D navigational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The main white matter tracts were constructed by the DTI datasets, and merged to the anatomical structure, which was delineated by the T1‐weighted three‐dimensional fast spoiled gradient recalled sequence (3D/FSPGR). The relationship between the tumors and adjacent pyramidal tracts were segmented and reconstructed for three‐dimensional visualization. RESULTS: In 25 patients of trial group and 24 patients of control group, the statistic analysis confirmed well balance of main variations. The tumors were completely resected in 12 patients (50.0%) of control group and in 20 patients (80.0%) of trial group (P < 0.05). Postoperative aggravated contralateral extremities weakness or hemiplegia due to pyramidal tract injury occurring in 75.0% cases of control group whereas only 20.0% patients in trial group (P < 0.01). The mean Karnofsky scale were 69.58 +/‐ 23.49 and 84.80 +/‐ 23.49 respectively in control and trial groups (P < 0.05). The excellent outcome ratio (Karnofsky scale = 90 ‐ 100) was 37.5% in control group and 72.0% in trial group respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DTI allows individual estimation of large fiber tracts of brain. Furthermore, to integrate spatial three‐dimensional information concerning the white matter tracts into traditional neuronavigation images during surgery, was valuable in presenting topographical character of involving (shift or erosive) pyramidal tracts and relationship with the margins of neighboring tumors. The mapping of large fiber tracts was a safe, efficient, reliable technique. DTI should be routinely used in neuronavigation surgery of brain tumor involving pyramidal tracts to plan the optimal trajectory and ensure total resection of the lesions during operation, as well as to decrease potential disability after operation and to shorten the length of hospitalization.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported abnormal changes in relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by histogram and region‐of‐interest‐based methods by using diffusion tenor imaging. However, there are few studies on specific white matter fiber tracts of RRMS. Our study sought to use diffusion tensor tractography‐based group mapping to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal‐appearing pyramidal tract (PYT) of RRMS and its possible mechanism. METHODS: A PYT probability map was first constructed from data on 20 healthy patients based on the deterministic‐based tractography method. The PYT probability map was then applied to 29 RRMS patients to calculate diffusion indices of the PYT. In this study, 4 quantitative indices‐fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally averaged diffusion coefficient (D(av)), axial diffusion coefficient (lambda(1)), and radial diffusion coefficient (lambda(23))‐were used to characterize the abnormal diffusion. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, RRMS patients had a significantly higher D(av) and lambda(23) but a lower FA and a trend toward a lower lambda(1) in the normal‐appearing PYT. In RRMS patients, PYT lesions had a significantly higher lambda(23) and a lower FA, but there were no differences for D(av) and lambda(1) when compared with the normal‐appearing PYT. Moreover, the diffusion indices derived from the normal‐appearing PYT were significantly correlated with PYT lesion volumes by using the Spearman correlation analysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal‐appearing PYT of RRMS patients and suggest that wallerian degeneration might be its mechanism.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The dominant inferior parietal lobe (IPL) contains cortical and subcortical structures that serve language processing. A high incidence of postoperative short‐term aphasia and good potential for language reorganization have been observed. The authors' goal was to study the plasticity of the language cortex and language‐related fibers in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) located in the IPL. METHODS: A total of 6 patients who underwent microsurgical treatment of an IPL BAVM were prospectively recruited between September 2016 and May 2018. Blood oxygen level‐dependent functional MRI (BOLD‐fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed within 1 week before and 6 months after microsurgery. Language‐related white matter (WM) eloquent fiber tracts and their contralateral homologous fiber tracts were tracked. The Western Aphasia Battery was administered to assess language function. The authors determined the total number of fibers and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) indices for each individual tract. In addition, they calculated the laterality index (LI) between the activated language cortex voxels in the lesional and contralesional hemispheres and compared these indices between the preoperative and postoperative fMR and DT images. RESULTS: Of the 6 patients with IPL BAVMs, all experienced postoperative short‐term language deficits, and 5 (83.3%) recovered completely at 6 months after surgery. Five patients (83.3%) had right homologous reorganization of BOLD signal activations in both Broca's and Wernicke's areas. More fibers were observed in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in the lesional hemisphere than in the contralesional hemisphere (1905 vs 254 fibers, p = 0.035). Six months after surgery, a significantly increased number of fibers was seen in the right hemispheric AF (249 fibers preoperatively vs 485 postoperatively, p = 0.026). There were significantly more nerve fibers in the postoperative left inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) (874 fibers preoperatively vs 1186 postoperatively, p = 0.010). A statistically significant increase in right hemispheric dominance of Wernicke's area was observed. The overall functional LI showed functional lateralization of Wernicke's area in the right hemisphere (LI ≤ ‐0.20) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings provide evidence for the functional reorganization by recruiting the right hemispheric homologous region of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, right hemispheric AFs, and left hemispheric IFOFs following resection of IPL BAVMs.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02868008 (clinicaltrials.gov).

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Surgical management of brainstem lesions is challenging due to the highly compact, eloquent anatomy of the brainstem. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in brainstem cavernous malformations (CMs). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was performed by using stratified blocked randomization. The primary eligibility criterion of the study was being a surgical candidate for brainstem CMs (with informed consent). The study enrolled 23 patients who underwent preoperative DTI/DTT and 24 patients who did not (the control group). The pre‐ and postoperative muscle strength of both limbs and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were evaluated. Muscle strength of any limb at 12 months after surgery at the clinic visit was the primary outcome; worsened muscle strength was considered to be a poor outcome. Outcome assessors were blinded to patient management. This study reports the preliminary results of the interim analysis. RESULTS: The cohort included 47 patients (22 women) with a mean age of 35.7 years. The clinical baselines between these 2 groups were not significantly different. In the DTI/DTT group, the corticospinal tract was affected in 17 patients (73.9%): it was displaced, deformed/partially interrupted, or completely interrupted in 6, 7, and 4 patients, respectively. The surgical approach and brainstem entry point were adjusted in 3 patients (13.0%) based on DTI/DTT data. The surgical morbidity of the DTI/DTT group (7/23, 30.4%) was significantly lower than that of the control group (19/24, 79.2%, p = 0.001). At 12 months, the mean mRS score (1.1, p = 0.034) and percentage of patients with worsened motor deficits (4.3%, p = 0.006) were significantly lower in the DTI/DTT group than in the control group (1.7% and 37.5%). Multivariate logistic regression identified the absence of preoperative DTI/DTT (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01‐0.73, p = 0.028) and use of the 2‐point method (OR 4.15, 95% CI 1.38‐12.49, p = 0.011) as independent adverse factors for a worsened motor deficit. The multivariate model found a significant correlation between poor mRS score and both an increased preoperative mRS score (t = 3.559, p = 0.001) and absence of preoperative DTI/DTT (t = ‐2.747, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: DTI/DTT noninvasively allowed for visualization of the anatomical relationship between vital tracts and pathologies as well as facilitated the brainstem surgical approach and entry‐point decision making. The technique was valuable for complex neurosurgical planning to reduce morbidity. Nonetheless, DTI/DTT data should be interpreted cautiously.■ CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE Type of question: therapeutic; study design: randomized controlled trial; evidence: class I.

N2  -  The optic radiation is a key white matter structure at risk during epilepsy surgery involving the temporal, parietal or occipital lobes. It shows considerable anatomical variability, cannot be delineated on clinical MRI sequences and damage may cause a disabling visual field deficit. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography allows non‐invasive mapping of this pathway. Numerous methods have been published but direct comparison is difficult as patient, acquisition and analysis parameters differ. Two methods for delineating the optic radiation were applied to 6 healthy controls and 4 patients with epileptogenic lesions near the optic radiation. By comparing methods with the same datasets, many of the parameters could be controlled. The first method was previously developed to accurately identify Meyer's loop for planning anterior temporal lobe resection. The second aimed to address limitations of this method by using a more automated technique to reduce operator time and to depict the entire optic radiation. Whilst the core of the tract was common to both methods, there was significant variability between the methods. Method 1 gave a more consistent depiction of Meyer's loop with fewer spurious tracts. Method 2 gave a better depiction of the entire optic radiation, particularly in more posterior portions, but did not identify Meyer's loop in one patient. These results show that whilst tractography is a promising technique, there is significant variability depending on the method chosen even when the majority of parameters are fixed. Different methods may need to be chosen for surgical planning depending on the individual clinical situation.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Stroke survivors with motor deficits often have pyramidal tract atrophy caused by degeneration of corticospinal fibers. The authors hypothesized that the degree of atrophy correlates with severity of motor impairment in patients with chronic stroke and predicts the response to rehabilitation training. METHODS: They performed a post hoc analysis of 42 hemiparetic patients (>6 months) who had been randomized to either 6 weeks of bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) or dose‐matched therapeutic exercise (DMTE). Arm function was measured using the Fugl‐Meyer (FM) and modified Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on the pontine level measured corticospinal tract (CST) atrophy by planimetric measurement of the mesencephalon (mesencephalic atrophy ratio) and fractional anisotropy (FA), respectively. Voxel‐based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) was used to determine the lesions associated with highest degrees of atrophy. The predictive value of CST atrophy for impairment and training response was analyzed. RESULTS: CST atrophy predicted baseline motor arm function measured by the FM and WMFT. The authors found only a trend for the correlation with FA. No measure of atrophy predicted response to either BATRAC or DMTE. CST atrophy was higher with larger lesions and those that affected the CST. VLSM identified internal capsule lesions as being associated with highest CST atrophy. CONCLUSION: Larger lesions, internal capsule lesions, and those overlapping the pyramidal tract are associated with greater CST atrophy. CST atrophy explains in part the variability of baseline deficits but does not seem to predict the response to BATRAC or unilateral arm training on upper‐extremity function.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Punctate ischemic lesions noted on diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) are associated with poor functional outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Whether these lesions increase long‐term risk of stroke is poorly understood. METHODS: We pooled individual patient data from the ATACH‐2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage) and the MISTIE III trial (Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation Phase 3). We included subjects with a magnetic resonance imaging scan. The exposure was a DWI lesion. The primary outcome was any stroke, defined as a composite of ischemic stroke or recurrent ICH, whereas secondary outcomes were incident ischemic stroke and recurrent ICH. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we evaluated the risk of stroke. RESULTS: Of 505 patients with ICH with magnetic resonance imaging, 466 were included. DWI lesions were noted in 214 (45.9%) subjects, and 34 incident strokes (20 ischemic stroke and 14 recurrent ICH) were observed during a median follow‐up of 324 days (interquartile range, 91‐374). Presence of a DWI lesion was associated with a 6.9% (95% CI, 2.2‐11.6) absolute increase in risk of all stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2‐5.7]). Covariate adjustment with Cox regression models also demonstrated this increased risk. In the secondary analyses, there was an increased risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.1‐11.0]) but not recurrent ICH (hazard ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.6‐5.1]). CONCLUSIONS: In a heterogeneous cohort of patients with ICH, presence of a DWI lesion was associated with a 2.5‐fold heightened risk of stroke among ICH survivors. This elevated risk persisted for ischemic stroke but not for recurrent ICH.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine whether lesion to activation distance (LAD) on presurgical blood‐oxygen‐level‐dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and degree of white matter involvement by primary or metastatic brain lesions predict perioperative motor and language deficits. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 76 patients with intra‐axial brain lesions referred for presurgical fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We measured expressive, receptive, global language and motor LAD and assessed degree of involvement of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). We performed a Wilcoxon rank‐sum test to determine whether the LAD and the degree of CST/SLF involvement were statistically significantly different between patients with and without preoperative or postoperative neurological deficits. RESULTS: In preoperatively symptomatic patients, motor and expressive language LAD were significantly lower (z = ‐3.78, P = .0002, and z = ‐2.51, P = .01, respectively) than in asymptomatic patients. No significant difference was noted in LAD between postoperative symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, except for a trend level effect for motor LAD (P = .07). The degree of CST involvement was significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 3.40, P = .0007 and z = 2.97, P = .003, respectively, for pre‐ and postoperative motor deficits).The degree of SLF involvement was significantly different between preoperatively (but not postoperatively) symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 2.85, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Presurgical motor and expressive language LAD as well as degree of tract involvement on DTI are predictive of preoperative but not postoperative deficits, except for CST DTI and (trend level) motor LAD; inability of language LAD to predict postoperative deficits suggests that preoperative fMRI is valuable to neurosurgeons in avoiding resection of eloquent cortex.

N2  -  Objective: To explore associations between changes of lower extremity function (LEF) parameters over a 5‐year period and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of white matter tracts among community‐dwelling older adults. Design: A secondary analysis on image and physical function data collected from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial (MAPT). Participants: 208 older adults (aged 75 ± 4 years, with spontaneous memory complaint or limited instrumental daily living activity or slow gait speed, 60% female) of the MAPT‐magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study. The time interval between a participant's enrolment and MRI scan was on average 110 ± 97 days. Measurements: Forty‐eight white matter tracts (WMTs) were measured. LEF parameters (measured after the MRI scan) were assessed as the short physical performance battery (SPPB) score, gait speed, and chair stands time over a 5‐year period. Mixed‐effects models were performed to explore the associations between baseline DTI values and the progression of LEF parameters. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparison correction. Results: The progression of LEF was associated with 35 baseline DTI parameters from 24 WMTs. Higher baseline DTI parameter values were related to more decreases in SPPB score and gait speed, and greater increases in chair stands time. Bilateral uncinate fasciculus was associated with all LEF parameters. Other WMTs in cingulum, cerebral and cerebellar peduncle, internal capsule, and corpus callosum also showed close connections with LEF changes. Conclusions: Our findings show that DTI parameters of some WMTs are associated with the 5‐year decline in LEF, suggesting that alterations in WMT integrity (evaluated by DTI parameters) might be used to explore potential causes of impaired mobility in older adults when no clear explanations can be found.

N2  -  Background: The anatomical distribution of acute lacunar infarcts has mainly been studied for supratentorial lesions. In addition, little is known about the association with distinct stroke symptoms, not summarized as classical lacunar syndromes. We aimed to describe the spatial lesion distribution of acute supra‐ and infratentorial lacunar infarcts and their association with stroke symptoms in patients eligible for thrombolysis. Methods: All patients enrolled in the WAKE‐UP trial (efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]‐based thrombolysis in wake‐up stroke) were screened for lacunar infarcts on diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI). The relationship between the anatomical distribution of supra‐ and infratentorial lacunar infarcts, their demographic characteristics and acute stroke symptoms, defined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, were correlated and compared. Results: Maps of lesion distribution from 224 lacunar infarct patients (76 [33.9%] females, mean age [standard deviation] of 63.4 [11.5] years) were generated using computational image mapping methods. Median infarct volume was 0.73 ml (interquartile range [IQR] 0.37‐1.15 ml). Median NIHSS sum score on hospital arrival was 4 (IQR 3‐6). 165 (73.7%) patients had lacunar infarcts in the supratentorial deep white or grey matter, while 59 (26.3%) patients had infratentorial lacunar infarcts. Patients with supratentorial lacunar infarcts presented with a significantly lower occurrence of deficits in the NIHSS items gaze (p < 0.001) and dysarthria (p = 0.008), but had more often a paresis of the left arm (p = 0.009) and left leg (p = 0.068) compared to patients with infratentorial infarcts. Conclusions: The anatomical lesion distribution of lacunar infarcts reveals a distinct pattern and supports an association of localization with different stroke symptoms. Trial registration: NCT01525290.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combined echoplanar MRI diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging (PI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be used to visualize acute brain ischemia and predict lesion evolution and functional outcome. The appearance of a larger lesion by PI than by DWI quantitatively defines a mismatch of potential clinical importance. Qualitative lesion variations exist in the topographic concordance of this mismatch. We examined both the topographic heterogeneity and relative frequency of mismatched patterns in acute stroke using these MRI techniques. METHODS: Acute DWI, PI, and MRA studies of 34 prospectively recruited patients with supratentorial ischemic lesions scanned within 24 hours of stroke onset (range 2.5 to 23.3 hours, 12 patients <6 hours) were analyzed. RESULTS: Ischemic lesions were predominantly in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (94%), with DWI lesions most commonly affecting the insular region. Mismatched patterns with PI lesion larger than DWI lesion occurred in 21 patients (62% overall), in all 4 patients imaged within 3 hours, and in 44% of patients imaged after 18 hours. A patient with a large PI but no DWI lesion and severe clinical deficit at 2.5 hours after stroke onset recovered completely. Regional variations in DWI and PI lesion loci were found, inferring site of proximal MCA occlusion, embolic pathogenesis, and regional arterial reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the topographic concordance of PI and DWI lesions in acute stroke reveals regional PI lesions without concomitant DWI lesions, which do not necessarily progress to infarction but may suggest stroke pathogenesis and site of current arterial occlusion. Location of DWI lesions may suggest an earlier site of arterial occlusion and regions of maximal perfusion deficit.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The use of diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) to define irreversibly damaged infarct core is challenged by data suggesting potential partial reversal of DWI abnormalities. However, previous studies have not considered infarct involution. We investigated the prevalence of DWI lesion reversal in the EPITHET Trial. METHODS: EPITHET randomized patients 3‐6 hours from onset of acute ischemic stroke to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or placebo. Pretreatment DWI and day 90 T2‐weighted images were coregistered. Apparent reversal of the acute ischemic lesion was defined as DWI lesion not incorporated into the final infarct. Voxels of CSF at follow‐up were subtracted from regions of apparent DWI lesion reversal to adjust for infarct atrophy. All cases were visually cross‐checked to exclude volume loss and coregistration inaccuracies. RESULTS: In 60 patients, apparent reversal involved a median 46% of the baseline DWI lesion (median volume 4.9 mL, interquartile range 2.6‐9.5 mL) and was associated with less severe baseline hypoperfusion (p < 0.001). Apparent reversal was increased by reperfusion, regardless of the severity of baseline hypoperfusion (p = 0.02). However, the median volume of apparent reversal was reduced by 45% when CSF voxels were subtracted (2.7 mL, interquartile range 1.6‐6.2 mL, p < 0.001). Perfusion‐diffusion mismatch classification only rarely altered after adjusting the baseline DWI volume for apparent reversal. Visual comparison of acute DWI to subacute DWI or day 90 T2 identified minor regions of true DWI lesion reversal in only 6 of 93 patients. CONCLUSIONS: True DWI lesion reversal is uncommon in ischemic stroke patients. The volume of apparent lesion reversal is small and would rarely affect treatment decisions based on perfusion‐diffusion mismatch.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Early surgical decompressive craniectomy (less than 24 hours) for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MCA) provides life‐saving benefits. Detection of the infarction territory with computed tomography (CT) scan is usually less sensitive and delayed than diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) that is capable of defecting the infarction territory in as little as 5 minutes after onset. Based on the DWI and clinical neurologic evaluations, ultra‐early (less than 6 hours) decompressive craniectomy for malignant MCA infarction may be very helpful in improving mortality and morbidity rates. METHODS: We treated 52 patients with malignant MCA infarction. Clinical neurologic presentation was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The infarction territory was evaluated by either DWI or CT. Patients were divided into three groups (Group A: ultra‐early, Group B: craniectomy beyond 6 hours, and Group C: no operation). Anterior temporal lobectomy was performed according to the ICP levels (ICP >30 mm Hg) after decompressive craniectomy. RESULTS: Group A had statistically lower mortality rates than Groups B and C (8.7% in Group A, 36.7% in Group B and 80% in Group C). Group A patients also had better prognosis of conscious recovery on the 7th day of onset (91.7% in Group A, 55% in Group B and 0% in Group C). Group A had statistically better Barthel Indexes than Group B, p < 0.05. Group A and Group B had better GOS levels than Group C, p < 0.001. Diagnosis by CT was accurate in only 33% of patients while the accuracy of DWI to detect malignant MCA infarction was 100% within 6 hours of onset. In surgical Group A and B, thirteen patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy, and 67% survived. All patients with ICP levels of more than 30 mm Hg who did not undergo further anterior temporal lobectomy died. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent decompressive surgery had better outcomes than patients who did not have the operation. Ultra‐early intervention with decompressive craniectomy with ICP monitoring before neurologic conditions become worse may reduce the mortality rate, increase the conscious recovery rate, and improve neurologic sequels for malignant MCA infarction. DWI with clinical neurologic evaluation (NIHSS, hemiplegia, down‐hill GCS) provides for early diagnosis and treatment of malignant MCA infarction. Anterior temporal lobectomy may further reduce intraoperative ICP and reduce mortality, especially when the infarction is at multiple arterial territories.

N2  -  Aphasia recovery after stroke depends on the condition of the remaining, extralesional brain network. Network control theory (NCT) provides a unique, quantitative approach to assess the interaction between brain networks. In this longitudinal, large‐scale, whole‐brain connectome study, we evaluated whether controllability measures of language‐related regions are associated with treated aphasia recovery. Using probabilistic tractography and controlling for the effects of structural lesions, we reconstructed whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) connectomes from 68 individuals (20 female, 48 male) with chronic poststroke aphasia who completed a three‐week language therapy. Applying principles of NCT, we computed regional (1) average and (2) modal controllability, which decode the ability of a region to (1) spread control input through the brain network and (2) to facilitate brain state transitions. We tested the relationship between pretreatment controllability measures of 20 language‐related left hemisphere regions and improvements in naming six months after language therapy using multiple linear regressions and a parsimonious elastic net regression model with cross‐validation. Regional controllability of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, and the anterior insula were associated with treatment outcomes independently of baseline aphasia severity, lesion volume, age, education, and network size. Modal controllability of the IFG pars opercularis was the strongest predictor of treated aphasia recovery with cross‐validation and outperformed traditional graph theory, lesion load, and demographic measures. Regional NCT measures can reflect the status of the residual language network and its interaction with the remaining brain network, being able to predict language recovery after aphasia treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Predicting and understanding language recovery after brain injury remains a challenging, albeit a fundamental aspect of human neurology and neuroscience. In this study, we applied network control theory (NCT) to fully harness the concept of brain networks as dynamic systems and to evaluate their interaction. We studied 68 stroke survivors with aphasia who underwent imaging and longitudinal behavioral assessments coupled with language therapy. We found that the controllability of the inferior frontal regional network significantly predicted recovery in language production six months after treatment. Importantly, controllability outperformed traditional demographic, lesion, and graph‐theoretical measures. Our findings shed light on the neurobiological basis of human language and can be translated into personalized rehabilitation approaches.

N2  -  Background. Debilitating brain injury occurs in 1.6‐5 % of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Diffusion‐weighed magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) studies have reported stroke‐like lesions in up to 51 % of patients after cardiac surgery. The majority of the lesions seem to be caused by emboli, but inadequate blood flow caused by other mechanisms may increase ischaemia in the penumbra or cause watershed infarcts. During CPB, blood pressure can be below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation. Although much debated, the constant blood flow provided by the CPB system is by many still considered appropriate to avoid cerebral ischaemia despite low blood pressure. Methods/Design. The PPCI trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02185885) is a single‐centre superiority trial, with blinded outcome assessment, including 210 patients with coronary vessel and/or valve disease undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of CPB. The patients will be stratified by age and by type of cardiac surgery, and randomised 1:1 to either an increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) (70‐80 mm Hg) or 'usual practice' with MAP (40‐50 mm Hg) during CPB. In both groups CPB blood flow is maintained equal and fixed. The primary outcome measure is the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (sum in mL), expressed as the difference between a baseline DWI scan and an equal scan conducted day 3‐6 postoperatively. Secondary endpoints are total number of new ischemic cerebral lesions, postoperative cognive function, diffuse cerebral injury evaluated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and evaluation of biochemical markers of cerebral injury at 4 time points. A PPCI pilot study of 12 patients demonstrated the feasibility of achieving a highly significant difference in average MAP between the intervention group and the control group (mean [SD] 68 [5.6] vs. 45 [4.3] mm Hg, p<0.0001). In 5 of 12 patients new infarcts were found using DWI. The sample size will enable us to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome measure in the intervention as compared to the control group at a significance level of 0.05 and with a power of 0.80. Results. Preliminary results are expected to be ready for presentation at the EACTA Annual Congress 2016. Discussion. This is the first clinical, randomised study to evaluate whether MAP during CPB influences the occurrence of brain lesions detected by DWI. If an increased MAP during CPB proves beneficial, the intervention to achieve this goal can easily be implemented in clinical management.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) is a promising stroke drug candidate. The present phase IIa study assessed safety and tolerability over a broad dose range of G‐CSF doses in acute ischemic stroke patients and explored outcome data. METHODS: Four intravenous dose regimens (total cumulative doses of 30‐180 μg/kg over the course of 3 days) of G‐CSF were tested in 44 patients in a national, multicenter, randomized, placebo‐controlled dose escalation study (NCT00132470; www.clinicaltrial.gov). Main inclusion criteria were a 12‐hour time window after stroke onset, infarct localization to the middle cerebral artery territory, a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale range of 4 to 22, and presence of diffusion‐weighted imaging/perfusion‐weighted imaging mismatch. RESULTS: Concerning the primary safety end points, we observed no increase of thromboembolic events in the active treatment groups, and no increase in related serious adverse events. G‐CSF led to expected increases in neutrophils and monocytes that resolved rapidly after end of treatment. We observed a clinically insignificant drug‐related decrease of platelets. As expected from the low number of patients, we did not observe significant differences in clinical outcome in treatment vs. placebo. In exploratory analyses, we observed an interesting dose‐dependent beneficial effect of treatment in patients with DWI lesions > 14‐17 cm³. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that G‐CSF was well‐tolerated even at high dosages in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and that a substantial increase in leukocytes appears not problematic in stroke patients. In addition, exploratory analyses suggest treatment effects in patients with larger baseline diffusion‐weighted imaging lesions. The obtained data provide the basis for a second trial aimed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of G‐CSF on clinical end points.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF; AX200; Filgrastim) is a stroke drug candidate with excellent preclinical evidence for efficacy. A previous phase IIa dose‐escalation study suggested potential efficacy in humans. The present large phase IIb trial was powered to detect clinical efficacy in acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: G‐CSF (135 µg/kg body weight intravenous over 72 hours) was tested against placebo in 328 patients in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, and placebo‐controlled trial (NCT00927836; www.clinicaltrial.gov). Main inclusion criteria were ≤9‐hour time window after stroke onset, infarct localization in the middle cerebral artery territory, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score range of 6 to 22, and baseline diffusion‐weighted imaging lesion size ≥15 mL. Primary and secondary end points were the modified Rankin scale score and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at day 90, respectively. Data were analyzed using a prespecified model that adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, and initial infarct volume (diffusion‐weighted imaging). RESULTS: G‐CSF treatment failed to meet the primary and secondary end points of the trial. For additional end points such as mortality, Barthel index, or infarct size at day 30, G‐CSF did not show efficacy either. There was, however, a trend for reduced infarct growth in the G‐CSF group. G‐CSF showed the expected peripheral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, with a strong increase in leukocytes and monocytes. In parallel, the cytokine profile showed a significant decrease of interleukin‐1. CONCLUSIONS: G‐CSF, a novel and promising drug candidate with a comprehensive preclinical and clinical package, did not provide any significant benefit with respect to either clinical outcome or imaging biomarkers.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Image guided surgery (IGS) has become an established technology in surgical management of cerebral tumors. We set out to determine whether IGS could improve extent of tumor resection in cases with cerebral tumors involving eloquent cortical areas along with more desirable prognosis. Methods: From 2008 to 2015, 20 children (median age 8.5 years) with cerebral gliomas involving eloquent cortical areas were randomized equally into trial (IGS) and control group (conventional surgery). Patients in trial group underwent functional multi‐slice 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) 48 hours before surgery. DTI datasets were merged with anatomical structures.Results: The statistic analysis con‐firmed well balance of main variations in both groups. Average mean preoperative tumor volume in trial and control group was 30.37±3.56 cm3 and 28.82±3.15 cm3 respectively (P value. 0.05). Early post‐operative MRI revealed 2.71±2.12 cm3 and 7.78±3.79 cm3 as mean residual tumor volume in trial and control group respectively (P value,0.05). Eight patients in trial group experienced radical resection (.95%); however, radical resection was just achieved in 2 patients (P value, 0.05). While there was no significant difference between mean Lansky performance scale (LPS) in both groups of patients before operation, 88.09±20.43 and 66.38±19.32 were recorded as mean LPS for trial and control group respectively (P value, 0.05). Conclusions: IGS using neuronavigation system combined with DTI, allows 3D evaluation of the tumor and tract mapping, along with optimal trajectory planning and higher extent of tumor resection with minimal post‐operative neurological deficits in pediatric population.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Low blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) correlates with the development of postoperative cerebral ischemic lesions related to generation of microemboli during dissection of carotid arteries in carotid endarterectomy (CEA). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospectively controlled trial was to determine whether increased mean blood flow velocity in the MCA by intentional hypertension during carotid dissection in CEA prevented postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli. METHODS: Patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (>70%) underwent CEA under transcranial Doppler monitoring of mean blood flow velocity and microembolic signals in the ipsilateral MCA. Attempts were made to keep systolic blood pressure during carotid dissection between ‐10% and +10% of the preoperative value (controls, n = 65) or above a +10% increase (intentional hypertension group, n = 65). RESULTS: Incidence of new ischemic lesions on postoperative diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging was significantly lower in the intentional hypertension group both for all patients (controls, 15.4%; intentional hypertension group, 3.1%; P = .03) and in a subgroup of 37 patients showing microembolic signals during carotid dissection (controls, 52.6%; intentional hypertension group, 11.1%; P = .013). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated the absence of intentional hyperperfusion (95% confidence interval: 1.77‐100.00; P = .012) and high number of microembolic signals (95% confidence interval: 1.00‐1.62; P = .05) during carotid dissection were significant independent predictors of the postoperative development of new ischemic lesions on diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: Increased MCA mean blood flow velocity by intentional hypertension during dissection of the carotid artery in CEA prevents the postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli.

N2  -  To investigate the increase in MRI contrast enhancement (CE) occurring in glioblastoma during the period between surgery and initiation of chemo‐radiotherapy, thirty‐seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were analyzed by early post‐operative magnetic resonance (EPMR) imaging within three days of surgery and by pre‐adjuvant magnetic resonance (PAMR) examination before adjuvant therapy. Areas of new CE were investigated by use of EPMR diffusion‐weighted imaging and PAMR perfusion imaging (by arterial spin‐labeling). PAMR was acquired, on average, 29.9 days later than EPMR (range 20‐37 days). During this period an increased area of CE was observed for 17/37 patients. For 3/17 patients these regions were confined to areas of reduced EPMR diffusion, suggesting postsurgical infarct. For the other 14/17 patients, these areas suggested progression. For 11/17 patients the co‐occurrence of hyperperfusion in PAMR perfusion suggested progression. PAMR perfusion and EPMR diffusion did not give consistent results for 3/17 patients for whom small new areas of CE were observed, presumably because of the poor spatial resolution of perfusion imaging. Before initiation of adjuvant therapy, areas of new CE of resected glioblastomas are frequently observed. Most of these suggest tumor progression, according to EPMR diffusion and PAMR perfusion criteria.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Cerebrolysin combined with rehabilitation therapy supports additional motor recovery in stroke patients with severe motor impairment. This study analyzed the combined data from the two phase IV prospective, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials. Stroke patients were included within seven days after stroke onset and were randomized to receive a 21‐day treatment course of either Cerebrolysin or placebo with standardized rehabilitation therapy. Assessments were performed at baseline, immediately after the treatment course, and 90 days after stroke onset. The plasticity of the motor system was assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI. In total, 110 stroke patients were included for the full analysis set (Cerebrolysin n = 59, placebo n = 51). Both groups showed significant motor recovery over time. Repeated‐measures analysis of varianceshowed a significant interaction between time and type of intervention as measured by the Fugl–Meyer Assessment (p < 0.05). The Cerebrolysin group demonstrated less degenerative changes in the major motor‐related white matter tracts over time than the placebo group. In conclusion, Cerebrolysin treatment as an add‐on to a rehabilitation program is a promising pharmacologic approach that is worth considering in order to enhance motor recovery in ischemic stroke patients with severe motor impairment.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To investigate normal‐appearing white (NAWM) and cortical gray (NAGM) matter separately in multiple sclerosis (MS) in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 64 MS patients (12 primary progressive [PP], 38 relapsing remitting [RR], 14 secondary progressive [SP]) and 20 healthy controls, whole‐brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were acquired. A stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) DTI sequence was used with minimal geometrical distortion in comparison to echo‐planar imaging (EPI). NAWM and NAGM were identified using conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images, allowing a cautious assessment of FA in cortex. RESULTS: Histogram analyses showed significant global FA decreases and ADC increases in MS NAWM compared to control WM. MS cortical NAGM had no significant global ADC increase, but FA was decreased significantly. In regional analyses, nearly all NAWM regions‐of‐interest (ROIs) had significantly increased ADC compared to controls, but FA was not changed. In nearly all cortical NAGM ROIs, ADC was significantly increased and FA significantly reduced. In multiple linear regression analyses in RR/SPMS patients, NAGM‐ADC histogram peak height was associated more strongly with clinical disability than T2 lesion load. CONCLUSION: Tissue damage occurs in both NAWM and cortical NAGM. The cortical damage appears to have more clinical impact than T2 lesions.

N2  -  Objective: It is not known whether use of a clampless facilitating device during proximal graft anastamosis decreases intraoperative cerebral emboli in patients with mild atherosclerotic ascending aorta (AAA) having off‐pump coronary artery bypass. Methods: After intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound showed no more than mild (grade I‐II) atherosclerotic ascending aorta, 20 patients were randomized to receive either partial clamping (PC, n = 10) or the HEARTSTRING clampless device (HS, n = 9) for proximal graft construction on the ascending aorta. Continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring, with capability to discern gaseous from solid particulates, was used intraoperatively to monitor high‐intensity transient signals (HITS) in the middle cerebral arteries. Postoperative diffusion‐weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging documented old and new ischemic brain lesions. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of proximals (P = 0.14), distals (P = 0.4), or intraoperative cell saver transfusions (P = 0.69). The total number of HITS was not significantly different between the PC and HS groups (P = 0.2). However, the number of solid HITS was significantly lower in the HS than in the PC group (2.7 ± 2.6 versus 14.0 ± 8.1; P < 0.001). The number of gaseous emboli in the HS group was fourfold greater when a mister‐blower rather than a suction device was used to clear blood away from the HS site. Postoperatively, there were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or clinical strokes observed in either group. Diffusion‐weighted cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed no statistical difference between groups for new infarct lesions. Conclusions: Use of the HS device during off‐pump coronary artery bypass was associated with significantly fewer intraoperative solid emboli in the middle cerebral artery than PC of the ascending aorta. © 2010 by the International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery.

N2  -  Over 3 consecutive days, the patients will be evaluated and will train on the rehabilitation robot REAplan® (http://www.axinesis.com/) to assess proximal bim‐MSkL and on the manual dexterity tool Dextrain Manipulandum (https://www.dextrain.com/) to assess distal bim‐MSkL. For proximal bim‐MSkL, patients will train over the 3 days on the serious game Circuit on the bimanual REAplan® and will be randomised to two different bimanual versions. By this means, the investigators will explore the components of bim‐MSkL in acute stroke patients. The motor skill learning setup (Circuit) that was developed and successfully used in healthy individuals and stroke patients has already been implemented in the REAplan® environment and will be used as innovative serious games based on a speed/accuracy trade‐off (SAT), allowing a detailed analysis of motor skill learning components (speed, accuracy, SAT, movement smoothness, dynamics...). For the serious game Circuit, who based on motor skill learning, the subjects will have to practice a complex circuit and move a cursor as quickly and accurately as possible by controlling the handles of the robot with both arms. For distal bim‐MSkL, patients will train on a complex sequence of finger movements involving both hands. Each day, several successive repetitions of the sequence will be displayed, corresponding to one block. 3 to 6 blocks will be repeated, each separated by 30 sec of rest. After training on the third day, a new sequence will be repeated for 3 blocks to assess generalization. To explore the role of different brain structures in bim‐MskL, Voxel‐based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) based on high‐resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, will be used to analyse the relationship between tissue damage and proximal/distal bim‐MskL scores on a voxel‐by‐voxel basis. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will quantify the integrity of several white matter tracts, allowing through correlation analyses to unveil the white matter tracts crucial to achieve proximal and/or distal bim‐MskL. In addition, several "classical" clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall motor‐sensory‐cognitive functions. In addition to the (sub)acute stroke patients, a group of healthy individuals who will not undergo MRI (n=60) will be enrolled as control group. Subjects in this group will also be randomized 1/1 in the two versions of the bimanual Circuit task on the REAplan® robot.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐based functional neuronavigation in surgery of cerebral gliomas with pyramidal tract (PT) involvement with respect to both perioperative assessment and follow‐up outcome. METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted between 2001 and 2005. A consecutive series of 238 eligible patients with initial imaging diagnosis of cerebral gliomas involving PTs were randomized into study (n = 118) and control (n = 120) groups. The study cases underwent DTI and three‐dimensional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The maps of fractional anisotropy were calculated for PT mapping. Both three‐dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data sets and fractional anisotropy maps were integrated by rigid registration, after which the tumor and adjacent PT were segmented and reconstructed for presurgical planning and intraoperative guidance. The control cases were operated on using routine neuronavigation. RESULTS: There was a trend for high‐grade gliomas (HGGs) in the study group to be more likely to achieve gross total resection (74.4 versus 33.3%, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference of low‐grade gliomas resection between the two groups. Postoperative motor deterioration occurred in 32.8% of control cases, whereas it occurred in only 15.3% of the study cases (P < 0.001). The 6‐month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of study cases was significantly higher than that of control cases (86 +/‐ 20 versus 74 +/‐ 28 overall, P < 0.001; 93 +/‐ 10 versus 86 +/‐ 17 for low‐grade gliomas, P = 0.013; and 77 +/‐ 27 versus 53 +/‐ 32 for HGGs, P = 0.001). For 81 HGGs, the median survival of study cases was 21.2 months (95% confidence interval, 14.1‐28.3 mo) compared with 14.0 months (95% confidence interval, 10.2‐17.8 mo) of control cases (P = 0.048). The estimated hazard ratio for the effect of DTI‐based functional neuronavigation was 0.570, representing a 43.0% reduction in the risk of death. CONCLUSION: DTI‐based functional neuronavigation contributes to maximal safe resection of cerebral gliomas with PT involvement, thereby decreasing postoperative motor deficits for both HGGs and low‐grade gliomas while increasing high‐quality survival for HGGs.

N2  -  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been described as "the complex somatic,cognitive, affective, and behavioral effects of psychological trauma". PTSD is triggeredby a severe distressing traumatic event, in which an overwhelming amount of stressexceeds the ability of the individual to cope or integrate the emotions involved in theexperience. The fact that a large portion of the affected population is previouslyhealthy, young people who were thrown off their life course, contribute to the greatmotivation for research in this field. But unfortunately, the current available treatmentimprove some of the symptoms in only 32‐66% of patients, and even after treatment, up to60% still meet PTSD diagnosis.In the last few years, there is growing knowledge regarding the neuro‐biological changesthat characterize PTSD. Brain imaging demonstrates alterations in regional brainperfusion, with stunning, hypoperfused regions. Those enduring brain‐biologicalpathologies may explain the limited success rate of currently available interventions.Accumulating studies presents evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can induceneuroplasticity and recovery of metabolic injured brain tissues, even years after theacute insults. HBOT can initiate several brain‐repair related mechanisms including brainangiogenesis; improve cerebral vascular flow enable regeneration of axonal white matter,stimulate axonal growth, promote blood‐brain barrier integrity and reduce inflammatoryreactions, as well as in brain edema.The potential beneficial effects of HBOT were demonstrated in several clinical trials oftraumatic brain injury(TBI)/post‐concussion patients. Some of these trials, especiallythose in veterans, included patients who, in addition to post‐concussion syndrome, hadPTSD; as it is estimated that half of the soldiers with post‐concussion syndrome due tomild TBI also meet the criteria of PTSD.The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of HBOT on PTSD symptoms inadults with treatment resistant PTSD who were not exposed to TBI or blast injury. Inaddition to the clinical outcome, brain functionality and microstructure will also beevaluated by PET and DTI‐MRI in order to shed additional light on the pathophysiology ofPTSD and its response to treatment.Study protocol:Thirty male patients with adult onset PTSD, defined by DSM‐V criteria, as a result ofcombat or a terror‐ related event, will be recruited to the study. Further criteria forstudy inclusion will be: age 25‐60 years, 4‐years or more from the traumatic event andfailure to improve with at least one line of conventional treatment.Study exclusion criteria will be: a history of traumatic brain injury or blast injury,epilepsy, a brain tumor; skull base fractures or neurosurgery, severe substance usedisorders, a current manic episode, psychotic disorders or serious suicidal ideation atbaseline; or major cognitive deficits; a history of HBOT for any reason prior to studyenrollment; chest pathology incompatible with pressure changes (including active asthma);inner ear disease; the inability to perform an awake brain MRI test; and the inability toprovide informed consent.After recruitment, participants will be randomized to one of two study groups . Atreatment group will proceed to a course of HBOT, while participants in the control groupwill continue with the current standard of care of psychiatric support and medications.After 3 months of follow up, participants of both groups will be re‐evaluated. Theindividuals in the control group will then be offered to receive the treatment and to bere‐reevaluated after the treatment is over (3 months). Further evaluation will be done at6 and 12 month to evaluate long term effects of the treatment. During the study, allparticipant will continue with their current medications unless otherwise advise by theirtreating physician.According to the HBOT protocol, 60 daily HBOT sessions will be administrated 5 days perweek. Comprise of 90 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 2 ATA, with 5‐minute air breaksevery 20 minutes.Study end points:Primary end point PTSD symptoms, as assessed by the PTSD questionnaireSecondary end points 1.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: This is a randomised, blinded and controlled Phase I/IIa trial to measure the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a combined cell transplantation and intensive rehabilitation intervention to treat spinal cord injury. The trial aims to examine whether transplantation of olfactory cell nerve bridges combined with intensive rehabilitation is safe and feasible for people living with chronic spinal cord injury in Australia, and whether the intervention improves structural integrity of the spinal cord, functional recovery, overall health, and social wellbeing. For the olfactory cell nerve bridge transplant, cells from inside the patient’s own nose will be purified and engrafted as 3D cellular nerve bridges of 1‐2 cm in length Participants will receive a dose that is dependent on the size of the accessible space within the injury site of the spinal cord with up to 60 million cells being engrafted. The surgery for the transplantation will be performed by a neurosurgeon in which the spinal cord will be exposed to enable the nerve bridges to be placed into the injury site. The duration of the procedure will be 3‐4 hours. Surgical notes will be used to monitor adherence to the protocol. For intensive exercise rehabilitation, the intervention will be supervised and provided by physiotherapists and exercise physiologists at a for‐purpose neurorehabilitation facility. The mode of administration will be one‐on‐one sessions. The 12‐ and 32‐week rehabilitation programs will consist of up to 3 hours per day at the rehabilitation service providers, for 5 days per week. Participants will attend the provider that is within their geographical area. Over each week, sessions will involve a range and mi Xof activities which could include, but are not limited to, standing, gait t CONDITION: Neurological ‐ Other neurological disorders Physical Medicine / Rehabilitation ‐ Other physical medicine / rehabilitation Spinal Cord Injury; ; Spinal Cord Injury PRIMARY OUTCOME: Efficacy[assessment of repair of the injury site by measuring anatomical changes to the injury site, tractography, spinal cord axonal tracts, and neurological function, via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI).

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for high grade glioma (HGG) remains neurosurgical resection followed by concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Overall survival (OS) for GBM is roughly 12‐16 months. RT is associated with cognitive and quality of life (QoL) impairments. Advances are needed to improve OS while mitigating injury to the normal brain. BMX‐001 is a novel metalloporphyrin that radiosensitizes cancer cells and radioprotects normal tissue. METHODS: This multi‐ institutional, open‐label, phase 2 trial randomized newly diagnosed HGG patients to receive RT/TMZ with or without BMX‐001 (NCT02655601). Both arms received 6 weeks RT/TMZ (75 mg/m2). BMX‐001 was administered as a loading dose of 28 mg sc before RT, followed by 14 mg twice weekly for 8 weeks. Randomization was stratified by tumor grade and institution. Key eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed HGG, age ≥ 18 years, and KPS ≥ 70%. The primary endpoint was OS. Key secondary/ exploratory outcomes included cognition, QoL, and white matter integrity using advanced imaging. OS evaluation occurred after 84 deaths when a 1‐tailed logrank test (α=0.2) had 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.63. Two interim analyses and a final analysis were conducted using an O'Brien‐Fleming stopping boundary. RESULTS: Of the 160 patients randomized, 72.5% had GBM, and 62.5% were male. Analyses focused on 145 patients who completed RT/TMZ (74 with BMX‐001, 71 without BMX‐ 001). Median OS of BMX‐001+RT/TMZ group (31.3 [95% CI, 21.6, not reached] months) was longer than RT/TMZ group (24.7 [95% CI, 19.6‐ 32.6] months), HR=0.735; p=0.079 (significant at the predefined α level). Common toxicities (Grade 1‐2) attributed to BMX‐001 were injection site reactions (64), tachycardia (24), and pruritus (17) with no related Grade 4‐5. Diffusion tensor MR imaging indicated mitigation of dose‐related white matter damage in BMX‐001+RT/TMZ group. CONCLUSIONS: BMX‐001 is safe, and there is improved OS in HGG patients receiving BMX‐001.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of scalp acupuncture for spastic cerebral palsy (CP), and to explore its possible mechanism based on brain white matter fiber bundles, nerve growth related proteins and inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: A total of 90 children with spastic CP were randomly divided into a scalp acupuncture group and a sham scalp acupuncture group, 45 cases in each group. The children in the two groups were treated with conventional comprehensive rehabilitation treatment. The children in the scalp acupuncture group were treated with scalp acupuncture at the parietal temporal anterior oblique line, parietal temporal posterior oblique line on the affected side, and parietal midline. The children in the sham scalp acupuncture group were treated with scalp acupuncture at 1 cun next to the above point lines. The needles were kept for 30 min, once a day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indexes of magnetic resonance (FA values of corticospinal tract [CST], anterior limb of internal capsule [ICAL], posterior limb of internal capsule [ICPL], genu of internal capsule [ICGL], genu of corpus callosum [GCC], body of corpus callosum [BCC] and splenium of corpus callosum [SCC]), serum levels of nerve growth related proteins (neuron‐specific enolase [NSE], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], myelin basic protein [MBP], ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase‐L1 [UCH‐L1]) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 33 [IL‐33], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α]), cerebral hemodynamic indexes (mean blood flow velocity [Vm], systolic peak flow velocity [Vs] and resistance index [RI], pulsatility index [PI] of cerebral artery), surface electromyography (SEMG) signal indexes (root mean square [RMS] values of rectus femoris, hamstring muscles, gastrocnemius muscles, tibialis anterior muscles), gross motor function measure‐88 (GMFM‐88) score, modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score, ability of daily living (ADL) score were observed in the two groups. The clinical effect of the two groups was compared. RESULTS: After treatment, the FA value of each fiber bundle, Vm, Vs, GMFM‐88 scores and ADL scores in the two groups were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the above indexes in the scalp acupuncture group were higher than those in the sham scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05). After treatment, the serum levels of NSE, GFAP, MBP, UCH‐L1, IL‐33, TNF‐α as well as RI, PI, MAS scores and RMS values of each muscle were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the above indexes in the scalp acupuncture group were lower than those in the sham scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 95.6% (43/45) in the scalp acupuncture group, which was higher than 82.2% (37/45) in the sham scalp acupuncture group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture could effectively treat spastic CP, improve the cerebral hemodynamics and gross motor function, reduce muscle tension and spasticity, and improve the ability of daily life. The mechanism may be related to repairing the white matter fiber bundles and regulating the levels of nerve growth related proteins and inflammatory cytokines.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: The impact of baseline ischemia on Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and evolution over 24 hours may be distinct in late thrombectomy. We analyzed predictors of serial ASPECTS and clinical outcomes in the DAWN trial (Diffusion‐Weighted Imaging or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake‐Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention With Trevo). Methods: The DAWN Imaging Core Laboratory independently scored ASPECTS at baseline and 24 hours. Descriptive statistics characterized ASPECTS on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 24 hours, delineating ASPECTS change over 24 hours. Results: 206 subjects (mean age 70.0�13.7 years; 54.9% (n=113) female; baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale median (interquartile range) 17 (13, 21) were included. Baseline ASPECTS was median (interquartile range) 8.0 (7‐8), with 92/205 (44.9%) between 0 and 7 and 113/205 (55.1%) 8 and 10. 24‐hour ASPECTS was median 6.0 (4‐8), with ASPECTS change or infarct evolution having median ‐1, ranging from ‐8 to +2. Multivariable logistic regression showed older age (odds ratio [OR] for 10‐year interval, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02‐1.55], P=0.030) and dyslipidemia (OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.06‐3.19], P=0.031) were independently associated with higher baseline ASPECTS. Higher 24‐hour ASPECTS was predicted by endovascular treatment (OR, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.58‐4.81], P=0.0004), baseline glucose <150 mg/dL (OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.50‐5.46], P=0.001), lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89‐0.98], P=0.010), and older age (OR for 10‐year interval, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.01‐1.55], P=0.041). Internal carotid artery lesion location (OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24‐0.89], P=0.021) was inversely related to 24‐hour ASPECTS. Good clinical outcome (day 90 modified Rankin Scale score 0‐2) was predicted by 24‐hour ASPECTS (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.08‐1.96], P=0.014). Extensive infarct evolution (ASPECTS decrease ?6) occurred in 14/201 (7.0%). Elevated baseline serum glucose ?150 mg/dL was a predictor of ASPECTS decrease of ?4 points (OR, 2.78 [95% CI, 1.21‐6.35] P=0.016) as was internal carotid artery occlusion (OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.05‐5.88]; P=0.038). ASPECTS change was influenced by treatment arm (P=0.001 by Wilcoxon), including 0 ASPECTS change in 42/105 (40.0%) of the endovascular arm and only 20/96 (20.8%) of the medical arm. Conclusions: DAWN subjects enrolled with small infarct cores had a broad range of baseline ASPECTS. Twenty‐four‐hour ASPECTS, strikingly influenced by endovascular therapy, predicted good clinical outcomes. Registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02142283.

N2  -  CRPS: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by severe and disabling pain typically in a limb in combination with sensory, autonomic, trophic, and motor abnormalities like tremor and dystonia. A distinction is made between CRPS‐1, usually following an injury (fracture, surgery) without a nerve lesion, and CRPS‐2, in which a distinct nerve lesion can be identified. Brain mapping studies have provided increasing evidence that the central nervous system is playing an important role in the pathogenesis of CRPS. Reorganization of the somatosensory cortex and motor networks, with altered central processing of tactile and nociceptive stimuli as well as movement control has been demonstrated. Functional brain imaging studies suggest that the volume of brain activation differs between motor execution and motor imagery, but the distribution of cerebral activity tends to be similar. Under imaginary movement of affected hands Gieteling et al. (2008) observed that there was reduced activation ipsilaterally in the premotor and adjacent prefrontal cortex, frontal operculum, anterior part of the insula cortex, and the superior temporal gyrus. Stimulus‐driven, functional magnetic resonance imaging, however, are time‐consuming and prone to possible confounds, especially in clinical populations. In that perspective resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS‐fMRI), measuring the cerebral networks at rest (in absence of any task), is probably better suited to clinical examinations and is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. During recent years, a large number of studies have indicated that RS‐fMRI is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. The default mode network (DMN) is probably the most studied resting state network. It seems to be involved in several processes and is found negatively modulated by chronic pain. Only one published study has investigated cerebral networks and cerebral connectivity in CRPS. Here the default mode network displayed reduced connectivity with the S1 compared to healthy controls. This indicates that decreased connectivity may be a key feature in cerebral functioning of CRPS patients. No study, however, has so far investigated if the reduced connectivity in the DMN is reversed in CRPS patients who experience pain reduction after GMI or desensitization treatment. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is another magnetic resonance technique useful for revealing microstructural properties of tissue, particularly in cerebral white matter. Chronic pain has also been associated with reduced cognitive functioning. If this is caused by pain processing demands, competing with working memory and executive functions, the investigators would expect the cognitive capacity to be improved or restored if the pain is successfully treated. Graded Motor Imagery: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is a rehabilitation process and has been used to treat chronic pain conditions and movement problems related to alterations in the nervous system such as CRPS, postamputation limb pain, and back pain. The patients are trained in monitored steps which increase in difficulty as progress is made. The three treatment components include left/right discrimination training, motor imagery exercises and mirror observations of the unaffected limb, appearing as the affected limb. The components are performed sequentially, but require a flexible approach to suit the individual patient. The imagined movements have been demonstrated to activate motor cortical areas similar to those activated in the actual execution of that movement. Hypotheses: The following hypotheses will be investigated: 1. Patients, treated with GMI + D, experience a larger pain reduction compared with those subjected to D only. Desensitization: Tactile desensitization (D) is used to decrease hyperalgesia and allodynia by repeatedly touching the affected area with various materials. This has successfully been used clinically in the treatment of CRPS. 2. Non‐responders to D alone experience pain reduction when D is combined with GMI. 3. Patients with CRPS display reduced intra‐network connectivity in the DMN compared to healthy controls. 4. Reduced intra‐network connectivity in CRPS is associated with pain intensity. 5. Reduced connectivity in the DMN is reversed in patients who experience pain reduction after GMI and D treatment. This will be evident in the comparison of fMRI data obtained before and after treatment. 6. Microstructure of the cerebral white matter is changed during the intervention. Design:The effects of treatment with Graded Motor Imagery (GMI ) and D versus D alone will be compared with an open, randomized, semi‐cross‐over case‐control design. The study patients will be allocated to either GMI+D or D alone. After an initial treatment period of six weeks responders (R) stay in the same treatment group and continue this treatment. Non‐responders (NR) in the D treatment group will be offered an immediate combined treatment (GMI+D). Randomization: The recruited patients will be allocated in a ratio 1:1 by randomization with a fixed block size of 6. Analytical models: Self reported symptom burden and functional capacity will be compared between the two treatment groups and within each treatment group (i.e. comparisons before and after treatment and with each patient as his/her own control). The investigators will also compare the two intervention groups (CRPS patients receiving a GMI+D and D alone) with a non‐randomized comparison group of sex‐ and age‐matched healthy persons. Continuous, symmetrically distributed variables will be expressed by mean values with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) constructed by the Student procedure. Proportions will be presented using the Binomial model with the exact 95% calculated confidence interval. Assumed continuously distributed variables will be analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model with the initial value as covariate while contingency table analysis is used for group comparisons of categorical and ranked variables. The sample size calculation is based on distribution of the main variable, self‐rated limb pain measured by Visual Analogue scaling (VAS). Based on the assumption of normality, a significance level of 5 % (α = 0.05), a power of (β = 0.80) and a clinical relevant difference of one time Standard Deviation (SD), 21 patients should be included in each of the two treatment groups. There will also be a sex‐ and age‐matched comparison group of healthy persons (n:21). Interventions: Individually adjusted Graded motor imagery (GMI) and tactile desensitization (D). Measurements: MRI‐scanning (for analyses of Intra‐network connectivity in the DMN and DTI for microstructural changes in the white matter), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and Neuropsychological tests are performed before the randomization and 12 months later. Self reporting questionnaires will be performed at baseline, after the treatment period of six weeks, and at the 6 and 12 month follow up. This includes demographic variables, and a comorbidity check list of diseases related to the major organ systems, pain intensity measured by numerical scales for pain intensity and by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), consumption of analgesics and the questionnaires: CRPS Severity Score, if upper limb affected; Quick DASH (a short form of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure), if lower limb affected; Lower extremity functional scale, Impact of Event Scale‐6 if subjected to adverse life events, Insomnia Severity Index, The Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL‐ 25), Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Perceived self efficacy and the Bath CRPS Body Perception Disturbance Scale

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and positron‐emission tomographic scans may be aligned to intraoperative MRI to enhance visualization and navigation during image‐guided neurosurgery. However, several effects (both machine‐ and patient‐induced distortions) lead to significant geometric distortion of intraoperative MRI. Therefore, a precise alignment of these image modalities requires correction of the geometric distortion. We propose and evaluate a novel method to compensate for the geometric distortion of intraoperative 0.5‐T MRI in image‐guided neurosurgery. METHODS: In this initial pilot study, 11 neurosurgical procedures were prospectively enrolled. The scheme used to correct the geometric distortion is based on a nonrigid registration algorithm introduced by our group. This registration scheme uses image features to establish correspondence between images. It estimates a smooth geometric distortion compensation field by regularizing the displacements estimated at the correspondences. A patient‐specific linear elastic material model is used to achieve the regularization. The geometry of intraoperative images (0.5 T) is changed so that the images match the preoperative MRI scans (3 T). RESULTS: We compared the alignment between preoperative and intraoperative imaging using 1) only rigid registration without correction of the geometric distortion, and 2) rigid registration and compensation for the geometric distortion. We evaluated the success of the geometric distortion correction algorithm by measuring the Hausdorff distance between boundaries in the 3‐T and 0.5‐T MRIs after rigid registration alone and with the addition of geometric distortion correction of the 0.5‐T MRI. Overall, the mean magnitude of the geometric distortion measured on the intraoperative images is 10.3 mm with a minimum of 2.91 mm and a maximum of 21.5 mm. The measured accuracy of the geometric distortion compensation algorithm is 1.93 mm. There is a statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the alignment of preoperative and intraoperative images, both with and without the correction of geometric distortion (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The major contributions of this study are 1) identification of geometric distortion of intraoperative images relative to preoperative images, 2) measurement of the geometric distortion, 3) application of nonrigid registration to compensate for geometric distortion during neurosurgery, 4) measurement of residual distortion after geometric distortion correction, and 5) phantom study to quantify geometric distortion.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: Ideally within 6 hours (no later than 12 hours) of onset of suspected LOS or NEC patient will receive Pentoxifylline intravenous infusion 1ml/kg/h for 12h/day (60mg/kg/day) for 2 days. If the diagnosis of NEC or sepsis diagnosis is confirmed, this will be followed by 1ml/kg/h for 6hr/day (30mg/kg/day) on days 3‐6.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive one of the following interventions: 1. Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning ‐ Under standard conditions, two blood pressure cuffs will be placed, one on the left lower limb distal to the femoral cannulation site and one on the upper limb contralateral to the arterial line. Two to four cycles of transient ischaemia/reperfusion will follow induction of anaesthesia with completion prior to insertion of the delivery catheter. Each cycle will involve concurrent inflation of both upper and lower limb blood pressure cuffs to a pressure of greater than or equal to 200mmHg and at least 15mmHg greater than the systolic arterial pressure measured via the arterial line for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion (total 10 minutes). Patients will be sedated with intravenous propofol target controlled infusion and paralysed with intravenous rocuronium or cisatracurium. Doses will be initially calculated on a milligrams per kilogram basis at the induction of anaesthesia and titrated appropriately with ongoing administration for the duration of the procedure and extubation prior to transfer to the post anesthetic recovery unit. This intervention will be performed by dedicated research nurse or doctor with a minimum of 3 years clinical experience. All other researchers and clinicians will be blinded to randomization. 2. Targeted Temperature Management ‐ Mild cerebral hypothermia, targeting a nasopharyngeal temperature of 34.5 degrees celsius, will be achieved as described below. Cerebral hypothermia will be induced following general anaesthetic induction and maintained until closure of the skin (last stage of the procedure). Continuous temperature monitoring will be performed and titrated using nasopharyngeal temperature probe. A urinary bladder temperature probe and intermittent tympanic measures will be used for comparison /analysis. Hypothermia will be achieved by withholding routine warming devices, administration of cooled fluids and with use of a cooling device (Cincinnati Sub‐Zero Products Ltd, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Patients will be sedated with intravenous propofol target controlled infusion and paralysed with intravenous rocuronium or cisatracurium to prevent shivering. Doses will be initially calculated on a milligrams per kilogram basis at the induction of anaesthesia and titrated appropriately with ongoing administration for the duration of the procedure and in the intensive care unit, as required, until normothermia is achieved (36.5 degrees celsius to 37.5 degrees celsius). To avoid the deleterious effects of cerebral hyperthermia, slow re‐warming, controlled at a rate of 0.5 degrees celsius/hour will occur in the intensive care unit, where required, following completion of the procedure until normothermia is attained, with ongoing monitoring to ensure the occurrence of rebound hyperpyrexia is managed rapidly. This will take approximately 4 hours if target temperature of 34.5 degrees celsius is achieved intraoperatively. This intervention will be performed by the treating anaesthetists, who will be the only person unblinded to randomisation. CONDITION: Aortic Stenosis Perioperative Stroke Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) PRIMARY OUTCOME: Adverse events occurring secondary to either of the two trial interventions as determined by medical record and patient assessment for the following potential adverse events: ; ; ; 2. Targeted Temperature Management: Patients and their records will be assessed by researchers to detect the following intraoperatively, following established normothermia and again at 72 hours: ; ; a) Occurrence of arrhythmias or bradycardia < 40 beats per minute or requiring treatment. All patients will be monitored with telemetry intraoperatively and for 72 hours post‐operatively. ; 1. Remote ischemic preconditioning: The limbs used to induce remote ischemic preconditioning will be assessed by researchers at completion of the TAVI procedure following removal of the tourniquets, and again at 72 hours post‐procedure. This will involve a complete neurovascular and skin integrity examination. ; ; b) Electrolyte (including magnesium, potassium and phosphate) and glucose abnormalities in the blood requiring pharmacologic intervention, measured intraoperatively, following established normothermia, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively. ; ; c) Requirement for blood product transfusion or intervention to reduce bleeding. ; ; d) Occurrence of infection diagnosed by the treating clinicians, assessed by chart review at 72 hours. ; ; e) Time to extubation, assessed by chart review. ; ; f) Requirement for pharmacologic management of shivering, assessed by chart review. Technical success delivering the remote ischaemic preconditioning protocol as measured by completion of all cycles of cuff inflation prior to insertion of the delivery catheter. Technical success inducing and maintaining cerebral hypothermia to within 0.5 degrees celsius of the specified temperature (34.5) as measured by nasopharyngeal temperature probe. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Early complications including: 1) time to extubation; 2) respiratory tract infections; 3) Mortality (all cause and cardiovascular); 4) myocardial infarction; 5) clinically apparent stroke (minor, major); 6) bleeding (minor, major, life‐threatening); 7) acute kidney injury (AKN classification); 8) vascular complications (major, minor, percutaneous closure device failure); 9) conduction disturbances and arrhythmias; 10) other (conversion to open surgery, unplanned cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular septal perforation, mitral valve apparatus damage, cardiac tamponade, endocarditis, valve thrombosis, valve map‐positioning, TAVI‐in‐TAVI requirement. These will be assessed by medical record review. Mean single lesion volume of diffusion weighted imaging positive lesions. Number of new diffusion weighted imaging positive lesions Procedural complication including: 1) time to extubation; 2) respiratory tract infections; 3) Mortality (all cause and cardiovascular); 4) myocardial infarction; 5) clinically apparent stroke (minor, major); 6) bleeding (minor, major, life‐threatening); 7) acute kidney injury (AKN classification); 8) vascular complications (major, minor, percutaneous closure device failure); 9) conduction disturbances and arrhythmias; 10) other (conversion to open surgery, unplanned cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular septal perforation, mitral valve apparatus damage, cardiac tamponade, endocarditis, valve thrombosis, valve map‐positioning, TAVI‐in‐TAVI requirement. These will be assessed by medical record review. Total volume of new diffusion weighted imaging positive lesions. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) Informed consent for participation; 2) severe aortic stenosis requiring management with isolated TAVI with an Edwards SAPIEN‐XT prosthesis under general anaesthetic, as determined by the local 'heart team'; 3) Pre‐procedural mini‐mental state examination score greater than or equal to 24; 4) stable haemoglobin.

The investigators will include all consecutive patients with recent ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with unilateral lesion(s) of the parieto‐temporal left junction present on the Diffusion MRI (DWI) performed in acute phase at 24‐48h. All patients will undergo 2 MRI with tensor diffusion sequences (structural connectivity) and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) resting state sequences (functional connectivity) at inclusion and 6 weeks after rehabilitation with or without art therapy. The investigators aimed to demonstrate that early activation of the right hemisphere related to the practice of the visual arts could facilitate the recovery of language in later strokes completely disrupting the language areas of the left hemisphere.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Surgery remains the mainstay for treatment of primary glioblastoma, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current standard of care during surgery involves the intraoperative use of image‐guidance and 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA). There are multiple other surgical adjuncts available to the neuro‐oncology surgeon. However, access to, and usage of these varies widely in UK practice, with limited evidence of their use. The aim of this trial is to investigate whether the addition of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) to the standard of care surgery (intraoperative neuronavigation and 5‐ALA) impacts on deterioration free survival (DFS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a two‐stage, randomised control trial (RCT) consisting of an initial non‐randomised cohort study based on the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long‐term follow‐up) stage‐IIb format, followed by a statistically powered randomised trial comparing the addition of DTI and iUS to the standard of care surgery. A total of 357 patients will be recruited for the RCT. The primary outcome is DFS, defined as the time to either 10‐point deterioration in health‐related quality of life scores from baseline, without subsequent reversal, progressive disease or death. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was registered in the Integrated Research Application System (Ref: 264482) and approved by a UK research and ethics committee (Ref: 20/LO/0840). Results will be published in a peer‐reviewed journal. Further dissemination to participants, patient groups and the wider medical community will use a range of approaches to maximise impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN38834571.

N2  -  RATIONALE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used alone or in combination with physiotherapy for rehabilitation of stroke patients. TMS mapping can also quantify the excitability of the motor area in both the ipsilesional (IL) and contralateral (CL) hemisphere. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to measure the dynamics of cortical excitability by TMS mapping before and after treatment with low‐frequency (LF) rTMS in the contralesional hemisphere at three different timepoints. Furthermore, the patients were clinically evaluated during the same visit as the mapping to establish both short and long‐term outcomes after rTMS treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 16 participants with acute ischemic stroke were assessed 10 days post‐stroke by TMS mapping. The patients were randomized into two equal groups: a real rTMS group and a sham group. The rTMS group received LF‐rTMS to the contralesional hemisphere for 10 days, starting on the first day after the first mapping. Each subject was also evaluated by mapping on days 45 and 90 after stroke onset. The primary clinical outcome measured was the Fugl‐Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA‐UE) on days 10, 45 and 90 post‐stroke. At 10 days after stroke onset, both groups presented low excitability in the lesion side and high excitability in the non‐affected side. In the real rTMS group, at 45 days after stroke, a downward trend in the excitability of the contralesional hemisphere and an upward trend in the excitability of the lesioned side were observed. At 90 days after stroke, a tendency toward balanced excitability between both hemispheres was observed. In the sham group, at both 45 and 90 days, we observed increased excitability in the non‐affected side compared to the side with the lesioned motor area. At 45 days, the real rTMS group demonstrated a better recovery of the upper limb motor function than the sham group, but at 90 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrated that LF‐rTMS treatment enhances rebalance of the excitability patterns in both hemispheres and led us to question the "one size fits all" approach widely used in rTMS interventions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: In this study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the pattern of cortical activations after a simple motor task in patients with migraine and white matter (WM) abnormalities on conventional MRI scans of the brain. We also investigated whether the extent of brain activations was correlated with WM structural pathology measured using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI. METHODS: From 15 right‐handed patients with migraine and 15 sex‐ and age‐matched, right‐handed healthy volunteers, we obtained the following: (1) fMRI (repetitive flexion‐extension of the last 4 fingers of the right hand), (2) dual‐echo turbo spin echo scans, and (3) pulsed‐gradient spin‐echo echo‐planar sequence to calculate DT‐MRI maps. fMRI analysis was performed using SPM99 and cluster detection. We measured the volume, the average mean diffusivity (), and the average fractional anisotropy of all lesions seen on the dual‐echo scans. histograms of the normal‐appearing WM were also produced. RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers, migraine patients had a larger relative activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (P=0.01) and a rostral displacement of the supplementary motor area (P=0.03). The shapes of the curves reflecting the time course for fMRI signal intensity changes were similar between migraine patients and controls for all of the cortical areas we studied. Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients had significantly lower histogram peak height of the normal‐appearing WM histogram (P=0.02), which was found to be correlated with the extent of displacement of the supplementary motor area (r=‐0.80, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that functional cortical changes occur in patients with migraine and brain MRI abnormalities and that they might be secondary to the extent of subcortical structural damage.

N2  -  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of primary malignant brain cancer. Median overall survival (OS) for newly diagnosed patients is only about 12 to 18 months. GBM tumors invariably recur, and there is no widely recognized and effective standard treatment for recurrent GBM. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single‐agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor‐treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). Response duration was highly correlated with OS (r2 =.92, P<.0001), and median OS for responders was 24.8 months. Seven of 16 responders exhibited initial tumor growth on magnetic resonance imaging. Compliance appeared to be linked with both improved response and survival. The tumor growth model predicted tumor arrest and shrinkage only after several weeks of continuous NovoTTF Therapy, consistent with the observed clinical findings of initial transient tumor growth in some patients. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients. Some responders exhibit initial tumor growth before shrinkage, indicating treatment should not be terminated prior to allowing for the full effect of NovoTTF Therapy to be realized. OS is longer in responders than in nonresponders. High daily compliance rates may be associated with increased likelihood of an objective response and are predictive of improved survival.

N2  -  Objective: Loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA) plays a key role in secondary neurologic injury. However, the regional distribution of CA impairment after acute cerebral injury remains unclear because, in clinical practice, CA is only assessed within a limited compartment. Here, we performed large‐scale regional mapping of cortical perfusion and CA in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for malignant hemispheric stroke. Methods: In 24 patients, autoregulation over the affected hemisphere was calculated based on direct, 15 to 20‐minute cortical perfusion measurement with intraoperative laser speckle imaging and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording. Cortical perfusion was normalized against noninfarcted tissue and 6 perfusion categories from 0% to >100% were defined. The interaction between cortical perfusion and MAP was estimated using a linear random slope model and Pearson correlation. Results: Cortical perfusion and CA impairment were heterogeneously distributed across the entire hemisphere. The degree of CA impairment was significantly greater in areas with critical hypoperfusion (40–60%: 0.42% per mmHg and 60–80%: 0.46% per mmHg) than in noninfarcted (> 100%: 0.22% per mmHg) or infarcted (0–20%: 0.29% per mmHg) areas (*p < 0.001). Pearson correlation confirmed greater CA impairment at critically reduced perfusion (20–40%: r = 0.67; 40–60%: r = 0.68; and 60–80%: r = 0.68) compared to perfusion > 100% (r = 0.36; *p < 0.05). Tissue integrity had no impact on the degree of CA impairment. Interpretation: In hemispheric stroke, CA is impaired across the entire hemisphere to a variable extent. Autoregulation impairment was greatest in hypoperfused and potentially viable tissue, suggesting that precise localization of such regions is essential for effective tailoring of perfusion pressure‐based treatment strategies.

N2  -  In 2018, the SINch (Italian Society of Neurosurgery) Neuro‐Oncology Section, AINO (Italian Association of Neuro‐Oncology) and SIN (Italian Association of Neurology) Neuro‐Oncology Section formed a collaborative Task Force to look at the diagnosis and treatment of low‐grade gliomas (LGGs). The Task Force included neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro‐oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, a neuropsychologist and a methodologist. For operational purposes, the Task Force was divided into five Working Groups: diagnosis, surgical treatment, adjuvant treatments, supportive therapies, and follow‐up. The resulting guidance document is based on the available evidence and provides recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of LGG patients, considering all aspects of patient care along their disease trajectory.

N2  -  Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of multimodal Magnetic Resonance (MR) Image in the stereotactic biopsy of cerebral gliomas, and investigate its implications. Materials and Methods: Twenty‐four patients with cerebral gliomas underwent 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H‐MRS)‐ and intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI)‐supported stereotactic biopsy, and 23 patients underwent only the preoperative MRI‐guided biopsy. The diagnostic yield, morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed. In addition, 20 patients underwent subsequent tumor resection, thus the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy was further evaluated. Results: The diagnostic accuracies of biopsies evaluated by tumor resection in the trial groups were better than control groups (92.3% and 42.9%, respectively, p = 0.031). The diagnostic yield in the trial groups was better than the control groups, but the difference was not statistically significant (100% and 82.6%, respectively, p = 0.05). The morbidity and mortality rates were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Multimodal MR image‐guided glioma biopsy is practical and valuable. This technique can increase the diagnostic accuracy in the stereotactic biopsy of cerebral gliomas. Besides, it is likely to increase the diagnostic yield but requires further validation.

N2  -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective and well tolerated treatment for selected brain metastases; however, local recurrence still occurs. We investigated the use of diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) as an adjunct for SRS treatment planning in brain metastases. Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing complete surgical resection of a solitary brain metastasis underwent image analysis retrospectively. SRS treatment plans were generated based on standard 3D post‐contrast T1‐weighted sequences at 1.5T and then separately using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in a blinded fashion. Control scans immediately post operation confirmed complete tumour resection. Treatment plans were compared to one another and with volume of local recurrence at progression quantitatively and qualitatively by calculating the conformity index (CI), the overlapping volume as a proportion of the total combined volume, where 1 = identical plans and 0 = no conformation whatsoever. Gross tumour volumes (GTVs) using ADC and post‐contrast T1‐weighted sequences were quantitatively the same (related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test = −0.45, p = 0.653) but showed differing conformations (CI 0.53, p < 0.001). The diffusion treatment volume (DTV) obtained by combining the two target volumes was significantly greater than the treatment volume based on post contrast T1‐weighted MRI alone, both quantitatively (median 13.65 vs. 9.52 cm3, related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001) and qualitatively (CI 0.74, p = 0.001). This DTV covered a greater volume of subsequent tumour recurrence than the standard plan (median 3.53 cm3 vs. 3.84 cm3, p = 0.002). ADC maps may be a useful tool in addition to the standard post‐contrast T1‐weighted sequence used for SRS planning.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Contrast‐enhanced MRI is the preeminent diagnostic test for brain metastasis (BM). Detection of BMs for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) planning may improve with a time delay following administration of a high‐relaxivity agent for 1.5‐T and 3‐T imaging systems. Metastasis detection with time‐delayed MRI was evaluated in this study. METHODS: Fifty‐three volumetric MRI studies from 38 patients undergoing SRS for BMs were evaluated. All studies used 0.1‐mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostics) immediately after injection, followed by 2 more axial T1‐weighted sequences after 5‐minute intervals (final image acquisition commenced 15 minutes after contrast injection). Two studies were motion limited and excluded. Two hundred eighty‐seven BMs were identified. The studies were randomized and examined separately by 3 radiologists, who were blinded to the temporal sequence. Each radiologist recorded the number of BMs detected per scan. A Wilcoxon signed‐rank test compared BM numbers between scans. One radiologist determined the scan on which BMs were best defined. All confirmed, visible tumors were contoured using iPlan RT treatment planning software on each of the 3 MRI data sets. A linear mixed model was used to analyze volume changes. RESULTS: The interclass correlations for Scans 1, 2, and 3 were 0.7392, 0.7951, and 0.7290, respectively, demonstrating excellent interrater reliability. At least 1 new lesion was detected in the second scan as compared with the first in 35.3% of subjects (95% CI 22.4%–49.9%). The increase in BM numbers between Scans 1 and 2 ranged from 1 to 10. At least 1 new lesion was detected in the third scan as compared with the second in 21.6% of subjects (95% CI 11.3%–35.3%). The increase in BM numbers between Scans 2 and 3 ranged from 1 to 9. Between Scans 1 and 3, additional tumors were seen on 43.1% of scans (increase ranged from 1 to 14). The median increase in tumor number for all comparisons was 1. There was a significant increase in number of BMs detected from Scan 1 to Scan 2 (p < 0.0367) and from Scan 1 to Scan 3 (p < 0.0264). In 34 of the 51 subjects (66.7%), the radiologist selected the third scan as the one providing the clearest tumor definition. There was an average 25.4% increase in BM volume between Scans 1 and 2 (p < 0.0001) and a 9% increase in BM volume between Scans 2 and 3 (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who are being prepared for SRS of BMs, delayed MRI after contrast injection revealed more targets that needed treatment. In addition, apparent treatment volumes increased with a time delay. To avoid missing tumors that could be treated at the time of planned SRS and resultant “treatment failures,” the authors recommend that postcontrast MR images be acquired between 10 and 15 minutes after injection in patients undergoing SRS for treatment of BMs.

N2  -  Background/Objective: Malignant edema can be a life‐threatening complication of large hemispheric infarction (LHI), and is often treated with osmotherapy. In this exploratory analysis of data from the GAMES‐RP study, we hypothesized that patients receiving osmotherapy had symptomatic cerebral edema, and that treatment with intravenous (IV) glibenclamide would modify osmotherapy use as compared with placebo. Methods: GAMES‐RP was a phase 2 multi‐center prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled study in LHI. Patients were randomized to IV glibenclamide (e.g. IV glyburide) or placebo. Cerebral edema therapies included osmotherapy and/or decompressive craniectomy at the discretion of the treating team. Total bolus osmotherapy dosing was quantified by “osmolar load”. Radiographic edema was defined by dichotomizing midline shift at 24 h. Clinical changes were defined as any increase in NIHSS1a. Results: Osmotherapy was administered to 40 of the 77 patients at a median of 39 [27–55] h after stroke onset. The median baseline DWI lesion volume was significantly larger in the osmotherapy treated group (167 [146–211] mL v. 139 [112–170] mL; P=0.046). Adjudicated malignant edema (75% v. 16%; P<0.001) was more common in the osmotherapy treated group. There were no differences in the proportion of patients receiving osmotherapy or the median total osmolar load between treatment arms. Most patients (76%) had a decrease in consciousness (NIHSS item 1A ≥1) on the day they began receiving osmotherapy. Conclusions: In the GAMES‐RP trial, osmolar therapies were most often administered in response to clinical symptoms of decreased consciousness. However, the optimal timing of administration and impact on outcome after LHI have yet to be defined.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: The polyphenol resveratrol has been suggested to exert beneficial effects on memory and the aging hippocampus due to calorie‐restriction mimicking effects. However, the evidence based on human interventional studies is scarce. We therefore aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on memory performance, and to identify potential underlying mechanisms using a broad array of blood‐based biomarkers as well as hippocampus connectivity and microstructure assessed with ultra‐high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF‐MRI). METHODS: In this double‐blind, randomized controlled trial, 60 elderly participants (60‐79 years) with a wide body‐mass index (BMI) range of 21‐37 kg/m2 were randomized to receive either resveratrol (200 mg/day) or placebo for 26 weeks (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02621554). Baseline and follow‐up assessments included the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT, main outcome), the ModBent task, anthropometry, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation and neurotrophins derived from fasting blood, multimodal neuroimaging at 3 and 7 T, and questionnaires to assess confounding factors. RESULTS: Multivariate repeated‐measures ANOVA did not detect significant time by group effects for CVLT performance. There was a trend for preserved pattern recognition memory after resveratrol, while performance decreased in the placebo group (n.s., p = 0.07). Further exploratory analyses showed increases in both groups over time in body fat, cholesterol, fasting glucose, interleukin 6, high sensitive C‐reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and in mean diffusivity of the subiculum and presubiculum, as well as decreases in physical activity, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor and insulin‐like growth factor 1 at follow‐up, which were partly more pronounced after resveratrol. DISCUSSION: This interventional study failed to show significant improvements in verbal memory after 6 months of resveratrol in healthy elderly with a wide BMI range. A non‐significant trend emerged for positive effects on pattern recognition memory, while possible confounding effects of unfavorable changes in lifestyle behavior, neurotrophins and inflammatory markers occurred. Our findings also indicate the feasibility to detect (un)healthy aging‐related changes in measures of hippocampus microstructure after 6 months using 7T diffusion MRI. More studies incorporating a longer duration and larger sample size are needed to determine if resveratrol enhances memory performance in healthy older adults.

N2  -  Hemiparesis after stroke is associated with increased neural activity not only in the lesioned but also in the contralesional hemisphere. While most studies have focused on the role of contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) activity for motor performance, data on other areas within the unaffected hemisphere are scarce, especially early after stroke. We here combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elucidate the contribution of contralesional M1, dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) for the stroke‐affected hand within the first 10 days after stroke. We used "online"TMS to interfere with neural activity at subject‐specific fMRI coordinates while recording 3D movement kinematics. Interfering with aIPS activity improved tapping performance in patients, but not healthy controls, suggesting a maladaptive role of this region early poststroke. Analyzing effective connectivity parameters using a Lasso prediction model revealed that behavioral TMS effects were predicted by the coupling of the stimulated aIPS with dPMC and ipsilesional M1. In conclusion, we found a strong link between patterns of frontoparietal connectivity and TMS effects, indicating a detrimental influence of the contralesional aIPS on motor performance early after stroke.

N2  -  (1) Background: Memory deficits are common sequelae of pediatric Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Only methods for non‐focused cognitive remediation are available to the pediatric field. The aims of this feasibility trial are the description, implementation, and test of an intensive program specific to the training and re‐adaptation of memory function in children, called Intensive Memory‐Focused Training Program (IM‐FTP); (2) Methods: Eleven children and adolescents with ABI (mean age at injury = 12.2 years, brain tumor survivors excluded) were clinically assessed and rehabilitated over 1‐month through IM‐FTP, including physio‐kinesis/occupational, speech, and neuropsychology treatments. Each patient received a psychometric evaluation and a brain functional MRI at enrollment and at discharge. Ten pediatric controls with ABI (mean age at injury = 13.8 years) were clinically assessed, and rehabilitated through a standard program; (3) Results: After treatment, both groups had marked improvement in both immediate and delayed recall. IM‐FTP was associated with better learning of semantically related and unrelated words, and larger improvement in immediate recall in prose memory. Imaging showed functional modification in the left frontal inferior cortex; (4) Conclusions: We described an age‐independent reproducible multidisciplinary memory‐focused rehabilitation protocol, which can be adapted to single patients while preserving inter‐subject comparability, and is applicable up to a few months after injury. IM‐FTP will now be employed in a powered clinical trial.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: WM lesion segmentation is often performed with the use of subjective rating scales because manual methods are laborious and tedious; however, automated methods are now available. We compared the performance of total lesion volume grading computed by use of an automated WM lesion segmentation algorithm with that of subjective rating scales and expert manual segmentation in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Structural T1 and FLAIR MR imaging data from 50 subjects with diabetes (age, 67.7 ± 7.2 years) and 50 nondiabetic sibling pairs (age, 67.5 ± 9.4 years) were evaluated in an institutional review board‐approved study. WM lesion segmentation maps and total lesion volume were generated for each subject by means of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) Lesion Segmentation Toolbox. Subjective WM lesion grade was determined by means of a 0‐9 rating scale by 2 readers. Ground‐truth total lesion volume was determined by means of manual segmentation by experienced readers. Correlation analyses compared manual segmentation total lesion volume with automated and subjective evaluation methods. RESULTS: Correlation between average lesion segmentation and ground‐truth total lesion volume was 0.84. Maximum correlation between the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox and ground‐truth total lesion volume (ρ = 0.87) occurred at the segmentation threshold of k = 0.25, whereas maximum correlation between subjective lesion segmentation and the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox (ρ = 0.73) occurred at k = 0.15. The difference between the 2 correlation estimates with ground‐truth was not statistically significant. The lower segmentation threshold (0.15 versus 0.25) suggests that subjective raters overestimate WM lesion burden. CONCLUSIONS: We validate the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox for determining total lesion volume in diabetes‐enriched populations and compare it with a common subjective WM lesion rating scale. The Lesion Segmentation Toolbox is a readily available substitute for subjective WM lesion scoring in studies of diabetes and other populations with changes of leukoaraiosis.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: The cohort of stroke patients will be identified and will have had a cortical/subcortical stroke proven on imaging (CT/MRI). Those eligible for surgery will undergo a further MRI Stealth and tractography scan to determine preservation of motor tracts and for surgical planning. They will also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine presence of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs). The eligible participants and those who consent to the surgical procedure will then undergo implantation of the stimulators on the contralateral side of the lesion on the motor cortex extradurally. This will involve the patient being anaesthetised under general anaesthesia (GA), being positioned and with the use of the MRI STEALTH neuronavigation system to identify the contralateral motor cortex to the stroke side. One burr hole will be performed at the site identified followed by a small trepanation of the skull. Two (2) Lamitrode 44 electrodes (St Jude Medical, Neurodivision, Plano, Tx, USA) will be placed on the dura overlying the motor cortex as demonstrated by the MRI. We will then do a subcutaneous tunnelling of the electrode lead behind the ear to mid thorax, connect an extension lead of 60cm (St Jude Medical) and tunnelling that further to exit at the right or left abdominal fossa which will be connected to an external pulse generator. This operation is estimated to take about 60 to 90 minutes. They will then stay in the High Dependency Unit overnight for observations and have intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours post surgery. A postoperative STEALTH CT scan will also be performed to exclude any extradural hematoma and to fuse lead placement with the preoperative tractography data. The patients will then have their stimulation intensity identified via a recording of a motor‐evoked potential (MEP) elicited in the unaffected upper limb from the external pulse generator pulses. The intensity will be set as midway point between the field potential and active motor thresholds. After approximately 10 days and following the initial setting of stimulation intensity as stated before, the external pulse generator and the extension lead will be removed. The remaining electrode lead (in the mid thorax) will then be connected to the Proclaim Internal Pulse Generator (IPG) (St Jude Medical). This procedure will be done under local anaesthetic and will take about 15 minutes. The IPG will then be programmed to reflect the established stimulation intensity. This system/implant will remain in‐situ indefinitely as there are no long‐term risks from leaving the electrodes implanted. Following this, both implanted and non‐implanted groups will undergo intense physiotherapy sessions for the next 12 weeks. In the implanted group, one group will be randomised to have an immediate start (day 3) and the other group will have a delayed start i.e. starting at day 45. During and after this period of physiotherapy, they will assessed on their upper limb motor function. The physiotherapy sessions will consist of: ‐ daily (week days) x one hour intervention at the School of Physiotherapy ‐ home (GRASP) programme to be done daily (including weekends) {Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Programme (GRASP) is a programme designed to improve upper limb function in post‐stroke patients. It comes with a manual that will be distributed and taught to the patients to allow them to do the exercises‐range of motion, strengthening, weigh‐bearing, functional tasks and fine motor skills, at home to supplement the intense physiotherapy sessions. They are encouraged to spend at least half an hour each day doing those exercises at home) ‐ participants will rotate around a circuit of exercises which will include: stretching, strengthening individual major upper limb muscles (progressive resisted), functional upper limb activities (both unilateral and bilateral tasks) Exercises will be individualised to the participant's current ability and side affected. The programme is designed by Professor Leigh Hale (Head of Physiotherapy) and will be delivered by final year undergraduate physiotherapy students under the supervision of a School of Physiotherapy neurorehabilitation clinical educator/supervisor. Depending on when the participants are available, the participants can either attend as a group or individually‐this will not change their exercises as they will be individualised exercises. All patients will be given an exercise book as a log book to determine their attendance and exercises performed at home. CONDITION: Stroke PRIMARY OUTCOME: Feasibility of the procedure ; The feasibility of the procedure will be gauged from the success of each participant complying to at least 80% of the rehabilitation sessions and ability to successfully complete each of the clinical tests and procedures. Safety of the intervention ; The safety will be determined by the number and type of adverse events that occur whilst having the implant. ; The risk of having an adverse event in this procedure is that of any surgical or anaesthetic complication such as bleeding and infection. As the implants are implanted extradurally, there are no real risks for intracerebral or subdural hematomas; an extradural hematoma is theoretically possible but has not been encountered in over 60 cortical implants performed by the Principal Investigator (PI). Nonetheless, participants will undergo a post operative CT scan to determine position of the electrodes and also to rule out any underlying hematoma. ; Participants will be given 24 hours antibiotic prophylaxis to minimise risk of infection (risk is rare being 2‐4%). If they did pose to have a risk of infection, inflammatory and infection markers like Full Blood Count (FBC) / White Cell Count (WCC) and C‐Reactive Protein will be monitored. ; There is also a theoretical risk of seizures but these are isolated reports showing that the seizures were relate to intensity of stimulation. In this study, we use sub threshold stimulation and burst parameters that are known to be safe in TMS protocols and in previous implanted electrode studies performed by the PI. If there was a seizure, we would perform an EEG to confirm seizure activity, then stop the stimulation and treat with anti‐epileptics. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Individual acceptability of the intervention, determined by qualitative interview. The patients will be evaluated at pre‐op, 6 weeks post implantation, 12 weeks post implantation and then at 6 months post implantation by the physiotherapists to evaluate their upper limb function. They will be assessed with the following: ; ‐ Muscle strength testing (hand held dynamometer) ; ‐ Fugl Meyer‐upper limb assessment (UEFM) ; ‐ Motor dexterity (nine hole peg test) ; ‐ Wolf Motor Function ; ‐ Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) ; ‐ Stroke upper limb capacity scale INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Aged at least 18 years on the day of consent 2. capable of understanding and signing an informed consent form 3. have a cortical or subcortical stroke at least 4 months earlier, screened by prior CT/MRI and verified by study MRI 5. suitable and fit for surgery 4. been assessed by physiotherapy and deemed suitable (UEFM 20 to 50‐moderate to mild upper limb function; Motor Assessment Scale: 2/6 on the Upper Arm Function scale; likely to be able to participate in 80% or more of the 12 weeks of daily physiotherapy post‐surgery sessions)
