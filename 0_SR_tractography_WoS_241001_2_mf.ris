N2  -  Objective: To investigate how functional neuronavigation and intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) influence glioma resection.
Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven patients World Health Organization (WHO) grade I: 20; II: 19; III: 41; IV: 57 underwent resection for supratentorial gliomas in an operative suite equipped with intraoperative high-field MRI and microscope-based neuronavigation. Besides standard anatomical image data including T1- and T2-weighted sequences, various functional data from magnetoencephalography (n=37), functional MRI (n=65), positron emission tomography (n=8), MR spectroscopy (n=28) and diffusion tensor imaging (n=55) were integrated in the navigational setup.; Results: Intraoperative MRI showed primary complete resection in 27% of all patients ( I: 50%; II: 53%; III: 2%; IV: 28%). In 41% of all patients (I: 40%; II: 26%; III: 66%; IV: 28%) the resection was extended owing to intraoperative MRI increasing the percentage of complete resections to 40% (I: 70%; II: 58%; III: 17%; IV: 40%). Integrated application of functional navigation resulted in low post-operative morbidity with a transient new neurological deficit in 10.2% (paresis: 8.8% and speech disturbance: 1.4%) decreasing to a permanent deficit in 2.9% (four of 137 patients with a new or increased paresis).; Conclusions: The combination of intraoperative MRI and functional navigation allows safe extended resections in glioma surgery. However, despite extended resections, still in the majority of the grade III and IV gliomas no gross total resection could be achieved owing to the extension of the tumor into eloquent brain areas. Intraoperative MRI data can be used to localize the tumor remnants reliably and compensate for the effects of brain shift.

N2  -  The assessment of cerebral functions has long been the domain of positron-emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. The use of rapid imaging sequences and contrast agents enables physiological and pathophysiological cerebral processes to be assessed and monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Both T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced fast imaging sequences can be used to assess tissue perfusion, vascularity, and microcirculation by applying models developed in nuclear medicine. The diffusion of water molecules and hemodynamic aspects of the macrovasculature can also be monitored. Functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enables the visualization of neuronal function and activity, and MR spectroscopy makes possible the metabolic mapping of lesions and surrounding tissue. The advantages of MR techniques includes their low invasiveness, multiplanar imaging ability, and lack of radiation. This contribution discusses the clinical use of functional MR imaging methods and their role in neuroradiological diseases. Measuring perfusion and diffusion allows detailed insight into the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and is already being used routinely in acute ischemic stroke. Dynamic MR angiography enables the hemodynamic assessment of vascular malformations. In CNS neoplasms these imaging techniques can improve lesion characterization and the selecting, planning, and monitoring of therapy. Functional MR imaging techniques have also revolutionized the study of psychiatric illness; however,their clinical utility here is still limited. Initial results in patients with dementia and schizophrenia have provided insight into the pathophysiological changes of these diseases.

N2  -  In this feasibility study we propose a method based on sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for estimating simultaneously the intracellular sodium concentration (C-1, in mM) and the extracellular volume fraction (alpha) in grey and white matters (GM, WM) in brain in vivo. Mean C-1 over five healthy volunteers was measured similar to 11 mMin both GM and WM, mean alpha was measured similar to 0.22 in GM and similar to 0.18 in WM, which are in close agreement with standard values for healthy brain tissue (C-1 similar to 10-15 mM, alpha similar to 0.2). Simulation of 'fluid' and 'solid' inclusions were accurately detected on both the C-1 and alpha 3D maps and in the C-1 and alpha distributions over whole GM and WM. This non-invasive and quantitative method could provide new biochemical information for assessing ion homeostasis and cell integrity in brain and help the diagnosis of early signs of neuropathologies such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors or stroke.

N2  -  Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we applied a deep learning -based approach using the StyleGAN model to explore patterns related to MS and predict disease progression in magnetic resonance images (MRI). Methods: We trained the StyleGAN model unsupervised using T 1 -weighted GRE MR images and diffusion -based ADC maps of MS patients and healthy controls. We then used the trained model to resample MR images from real input data and modified them by manipulations in the latent space to simulate MS progression. We analyzed the resulting simulationrelated patterns mimicking disease progression by comparing the intensity profiles of the original and manipulated images and determined the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). Results: Our results show that MS progression can be simulated by manipulating MR images in the latent space, as evidenced by brain volume loss on both T 1 -weighted and ADC maps and increasing lesion extent on ADC maps. Conclusion: Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of the StyleGAN model in medical imaging to study image markers and to shed more light on the relationship between brain atrophy and MS progression through corresponding manipulations in the latent space.

N2  -  Rabies remains a virtually incurable disease once symptoms develop, Neuroimaging studies demonstrate lesions in the different parts of the neuroaxis, even before brain symptoms are evident. These abnormalities have been detailed in both rabies virus-infected humans and dogs with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI disturbances were similar in both forms (furious or paralytic) in human rabies; however, they were more pronounced in paralytic than in furious rabies virus-infected dogs in which examination was done early in the disease course. Abnormalities were not confined only to neuronal structures of hippocampus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and brain stem but also extended to white matter. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been clearly shown to be intact during the time rabies virus-infected patients and dogs remained conscious, whereas leakage was demonstrated as soon as they became comatose. Although the location of MRI abnormalities can help diagnosing rabies, the intensities of signals are usually not very distinct and sometimes not recognizable. Newer techniques and protocols have been developed and utilized, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, and the latter provides both qualitative and quantitative data. These techniques have been applied to normal and rabies virus-infected dogs to construct fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps. Results showed clear-cut evidence of BBB intactness with absence of vasogenic brain edema and preservation of most neuronal structures and tracts except at the level of brainstem in paralytic rabies-infected dogs. Neuroimaging is one of the most useful tools for the in vivo study of central nervous system infections.

N2  -  Purpose This study aimed to determine the accuracy of detecting ischemic core volume using computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke compared to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) as the reference standard. Methods This retrospective monocentric study included patients who underwent CTP and DW-MRI for suspected acute ischemic stroke. The ischemic core size was measured at DW-MRI. The detectability threshold volume was defined as the lowest volume detected by each method. Clinical data on revascularization therapy, along with the clinical decision that influenced the choice, were collected. Volumes of the ischemic cores were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Of 83 patients who underwent CTP, 52 patients (median age 73 years, IQR 63-80, 36 men) also had DW-MRI and were included, with a total of 70 ischemic cores. Regarding ischemic cores, only 18/70 (26%) were detected by both CTP and DW-MRI, while 52/70 (74%) were detected only by DW-MRI. The median volume of the 52 ischemic cores undetected on CTP (0.6 mL, IQR 0.2-1.3 mL) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that of the 18 ischemic cores detected on CTP (14.2 mL, IQR 7.0-18.4 mL). The smallest ischemic core detected on CTP had a volume of 5.0 mL. Among the 20 patients with undetected ischemic core on CTP, only 10% (2/20) received thrombolysis treatment. Conclusions CTP maps failed in detecting ischemic cores smaller than 5 mL. DW-MRI remains essential for suspected small ischemic brain lesions to guide a correct treatment decision-making.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Language dysfunction, visual deficit, numeracy impairment, and Gerstmann syndrome often occur in the cortical area; furthermore, the subcortical white matter is the inviolable limit of "functional neurosurgery." Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tractography are capable of providing the data required for safe "surgical planning" at both the cortical and subcortical levels.
METHODS: We report our experience regarding high-grade gliomas affecting the dominant angular gyrus (AG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and their respective subcortical areas using intraoperative MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Retrospectively, we reviewed a consecutive series of 27 patients operated in a BrainSuite for high-grade intraparenchymal tumors of the left posterior temporoparietal junction. We included tumors involving the dominant AG, SMG, andor IPS and the subcortical course of arcuate fasciculus (AF) and all the patients who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI to localize the AF and the eloquent cortical areas. Just after craniotomy, new volumetric MRI and DTI verified and corrected possible brain shift. After the gross total resection was carried out, and before approaching the residual mass close to the white matter tract, an intraoperative MRI was again performed.; RESULTS: We operated on 27 patients, 15 males and 12 females, whose diagnosis was always high-grade glioma. During the preoperative neurologic examination, 6 patients were asymptomatic; 3 presented a Gerstmann syndrome; 16 showed dysphasic disturbances, 6 of which were associated with visual field deficits; and 2 showed weakness of the right limb.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this approach is completely safe and effective as an alternative to awake surgery.

N2  -  Progress in imaging techniques has contributed to improvements in reliable diagnosis and surgical decision making in neurosurgery. From the viewpoint of neurosurgeons, there are two major needs in the development of imaging techniques. One is greater accuracy in demonstrating the anatomy of the brain at microscopic resolutions and the other is visualization of function or metabolism that is invisible on surgical views. Use of 3.OT magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in clinical patients has revealed anatomy appropriate for microsurgery at high resolution, and three-dimensional reconstruction of MRI on high-specification computers helps neurosurgeons to understand the anatomy of the brain in individual patients. Functional imaging methods such as functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and magnetoencephalography have provided new insights in brain surgery, visualizing various cerebral functions on anatomic images. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging is used to visualize neural tracts passing through subcortical white matter and MR spectroscopy is used to show the metabolic status of lesions. These tools are also forms of functional imaging. New noninvasive imaging techniques are still being developed to visualize function more easily. Here, we summarize the roles of recent imaging techniques in our previous studies and discuss the future of imaging in neurosurgery.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the location of white matter tracts with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) during neurosurgical procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical committee approval and signed informed consent were obtained. A 1.5-T magnetic resonance imager with an adapted rotating surgical table that is placed in a radiofrequency-shielded operating theater was used for pre- and intraoperative imaging. DTI was performed by applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions in 38 patients (20 female patients, 18 male patients; age range, 7-77 years; mean age, 45.6 years) who were undergoing surgery (35 craniotomy and three burr hole procedures). Color-encoded maps of fractional anisotropy were generated by depicting white matter tracts. A rigid registration algorithm was used to compare pre- and intraoperative images.; RESULTS: Intraoperative DTI was technically feasible in all patients, and no major image distortions occurred in the areas of interest. Pre- and intraoperative color-encoded maps of fractional anisotropy could be registered; these maps depicted marked and highly variable shifting of white matter tracts during neurosurgical procedures. In the 27 patients who underwent brain tumor resection, white matter tract shifting ranged from an inward shift of 8 mm to an outward shift of 15 mm (mean shift +- standard deviation, outward shift of 2.5 mm +- 5.8). In 16 (59%) of 27 patients, outward shifting was detected; in eight (30%), inward shifting was detected. In eight patients who underwent temporal lobe resections for drug-resistant epilepsy, shifting was only inward and ranged from 2 to 14 mm (9 mm +- 3.3). In two of the three patients who underwent burr hole procedures, outward shifting occurred.; CONCLUSION: Intraoperative DTI can depict shifting of major white matter tracts that is caused by surgical intervention.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in neurosurgical planning and follow-up is currently being defined and needs clinical validation. To that end, we sought correlations between preoperative and postoperative DTI and clinical motor deficits in patients with space-occupying lesions involving the corticospinal tract (CST).
METHODS: DTI findings in four patients with masses near the CST and not involving motor cortex were retrospectively reviewed and compared with contralateral motor strength. CST involvement was determined from anisotropy and eigenvector directional color maps. The CST was considered involved if it was substantially deviated or had decreased anisotropy. Interpretations of the DTIs were blinded to assessments of motor strength, and vice versa.; RESULTS: Of the four patients with potential CST involvement before surgery, DTI confirmed CST involvement in three, all of whom had preoperative motor deficits. The patient without CST involvement on DTI had no motor deficit. After surgery, DTI showed CST preservation and normalization of the position andor anisotropy in two of the three patients with preoperative deficits, and both of those patients had improvement in motor strength. The other patient with preoperative deficits had evidence of wallerian degeneration on DTI and had only equivocal clinical improvement.; CONCLUSION. Preoperative CST involvement, as determined on DTI, was predictive of the presence or absence of motor deficits, and postoperative CST normalization on DTI was predictive of clinical improvement. Further study is warranted to define the role of DTI in planning tumor resections and predicting postoperative motor function.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the significance of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) modality for the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of ventriculitis.
Patients and methods: Twelve patients with ventriculitis were enrolled in this study. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance images (MRI) and ADC maps of the periventricular white matter, intraventricular collections detected in the third or lateral ventricles and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained. The images and ADC data from each lesion were correlated and then compared amongst the different lesions. CSF studies were performed via external ventricular drain (EVD) catheters or lumbar punctures performed on the same day as ADC mapping. Linear regression was used to analyze relationships among pleocytosis, glucose, chloride, protein content of pus, and ADC counting.; Results: A total of 24 ADC values for intraventricular pus and CSF findings were obtained from 12 patients and analyzed. The DW MRI showed marked hyperintensity in purulent lesions, and the corresponding ADC maps revealed prominent hypointensity and decreased ADC values in dependent CSF compared with non-dependent CSF and normal white matter. Dependent CSF is defined as the CSF which is mixed with purulent discharge which is located at the lower portion of the ventricle by gravity. The correlations between ADC counting and pleocytosis, and also protein content were strong: r(2) = -0.84, r(2) = -0.62, respectively (p < 0.001).; Conclusion: A decreased ADC value and increased signal intensity of dependent intraventricular fluid by DW MRI suggests the presence of material with restricted water diffusion in the ventricular space. This is seen in pyogenic ventriculitis when water diffusion is restricted in suppurative fluid. ADC counting is negatively correlated with pleocytosis and the protein content of CSF. Therefore, the ADC value might be a useful non-invasive method for the follow-up evaluation of ventriculitis as well as the diagnosis of it. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  MRI assessment of diffusion changes in acute cerebral ischaemia necessitates analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). We used the concept of relative weighted mean ADC (rwmADC) to obtain an accurate estimate of the extent of infarcted tissue. We studied ten patient with of acute ischaemic stroke, using diffusion- and perfusion- weighted MRI The rwmADC was used to calculate a corrected ADC-lesion volume (DLVR), which was compared with the diffusion-lesion volume (DLV), initial perfusion lesion volumes and the follow-up infarct volume on T2-weighted images. We looked at correlations between the MRI and clinical findings. DLVR was closest to the final infarct size and had the best clinicoradiological correlation (r = 0.77). Weighting the mean ADC within the ischaemic and normal parenchyma can give a more correct estimate of the volume of infarcted brain parenchyma, thus improving the definition of the penumbra.

N2  -  Purpose: This study aims to test the ability of quantitative temporal diffusion spectroscopy (qTDS) to assess cellular changes associated with radiation-induced cell death in a rat glioma model.
Methods and Materials: Tumor response to a single fraction of 20 Gy of x-ray radiation was investigated in a rat glioma (9L) model. Tumor response was monitored longitudinally at postinoculation days 21, 23, and 25, using a specific implementation of qTDS with acronym IMPULSED (Imaging Microstructural Parameters Using Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion), as well as conventional diffusion and high-resolution anatomic imaging. IMPULSED method combines diffusion-weighted signals acquired over a range of diffusion times that are then analyzed and interpreted using a theoretical model of water diffusion in tissues, which generates parametric maps depicting cellular and subcellular structural information on a voxel-wise basis. Results from different metrics were compared statistically.; Results: A single dose of 20 Gy x-ray radiation significantly prolonged survival of 9L-bearing rats. The mean cell sizes of irradiated tumors decreased (P < .005) after radiation treatment, which we associate with cell shrinkage and the formation of small cellular bodies during apoptosis and necrosis. A combination of IMPULSED-derived parameters (mean cell size d and extracellular structural parameter beta(ex)) separated 90% of irradiated tumors from the nonirradiated cases at post inoculation day 23, whereas a combination of tumor growth and conventional apparent diffusion coefficient did not differentiate irradiated tumors from nonirradiated tumors.; Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the IMPULSED method to be a new method for deriving quantitative microstructural parameters in a preclinical tumor model. The method provides unique information based on the diffusion time dependency of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, which cannot be obtained by conventional diffusion weighted imaging methods, and the results have a close correlation with primary biologic markers of treatment efficacy, such as cell death and survival.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the value of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in differentiating persistent or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from nontumoral postradiotherapeutic alterations.
Methods and Materials: In 26 patients with suspicion of persistent or recurrent HNSCC, MRI of the head and neck was performed, including routine turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences and an additional echo-planar DW-MRI sequence, using a large range of b-values (0-1000 smm(2)). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated. In the suspect areas at the primary site and in the suspect lymph nodes, signal intensity was measured on the native b0 and b1000 images and ADC values were calculated for these tissues. The same was done for surrounding irradiated normal tissue. Imaging results were correlated to histopathology.; Results: Signal intensity on native b0 images was significantly lower for HNSCC than for nontumoral postradiotherapeutic tissue (p < 0.0001), resulting in a sensitivity of 66.2%, specificity of 60.8%, and accuracy of 62.4%. Signal intensity on native b1000 images was significantly higher for HNSCC than for nontumoral tissue (p < 0.0001), resulting in a sensitivity of 71.6%, specificity of 71.3%, and accuracy of 71.4%. ADC values were significantly lower for HNSCC than for nontumoral tissue (p < 0.0001), resulting in a sensitivity of 94.6%, specificity of 95.9%, and accuracy of 95.5%. When compared with computed tomography, TSE-MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, DW-MRI yielded fewer false-positive results in persistent primary site abnormalities and in persistent adenopathies, and aided in the detection of subcentimetric nodal metastases.; Conclusions: Diffusion weighted-MRI accurately differentiates persistent or recurrent HNSCC from nontumoral tissue changes after (chemo)radiotherapy.

N2  -  Purpose: This study aimed to further investigate the effects of agmatine on brain edema in the rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) injury using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring and biochemical and histopathologic evaluation.
Materials and methods: Following surgical induction of MCAO for 90 min, agmatine was injected 5 min after beginning of reperfusion and again once daily for the next 3 post-operative days. The events during ischemia and reperfusion were investigated by T2-weighted images (T2WI), serial diffusion-weighted images (DWI), calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and contrast-enhanced TI-weighted images (CE-TI WI) during 3 h-72 h in a 1.5 T Siemens MAGNETON Avanto Scanner. Lesion volumes were analyzed in a blinded and randomized manner. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), Nissl, and Evans Blue stainings were performed at the corresponding sections.; Results: Increased lesion volumes derived from T2WI, DWI, ADC, CE-TI WI, and TTC all were noted at 3 h and peaked at 24 h-48 h after MCAO injury. 'ITC-derived infarct volumes were not significantly different from the T2WI, DWI-, and CE-TI WI-derived lesion volumes at the last imaging time (72 h) point except for significantly smaller ADC lesions in the MCAO model (P < 0.05). Volumetric calculation based on TTCderived infarct also correlated significantly stronger to volumetric calculation based on last imaging time point derived on T2WI, DWI or CE-TI WI than ADC (P < 0.05). At the last imaging time point, a significant increase in Evans Blue extravasation and a significant decrease in Nissl-positive cells numbers were noted in the vehicle-treated MCAO injured animals. The lesion volumes derived from T2WI, DWI, CE-T1WI, and Evans blue extravasation as well as the reduced numbers of Nissl-positive cells were all significantly attenuated in the agmatine-treated rats compared with the control ischemia rats (P <0.05).; Conclusion: Our results suggest that agmatine has neuroprotective effects against brain edema on a reperfusion model after transient cerebral ischemia.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive value of the ischemic lesion size, as depicted in the acute stroke phase on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and time-to-peak (TTP) maps of tissue perfusion imaging, for infarct size, as derived from T2-weighted imaging in the postacute phase.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging within 1-24 hours after stroke onset and a follow-up T2-weighted investigation after about 8 days were included. Lesion volumes were evaluated by using a semiautomatic thresholding technique. Volumetric results of acute diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging were analyzed in comparison with follow-up T2-weighted images and in terms of the time difference between symptom onset and initial MR imaging.; RESULTS: At diffusion-weighted imaging, the acute lesion defined by a signal intensity increase of more than 20%, compared with the contralateral side, showed the best correlation with the infarct size after 1 week. At perfusion imaging, the best predictor relative to the contralateral side was a delay of more than 6 seconds on TTP maps. Temporal analysis of volumetric results, which depended on the time difference between symptom onset and examination, revealed two patient subgroups.; CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted imaging helped to predict the size of the lesion on T2-weighted images obtained after about 8 days in patients with a symptom onset of more than 4 hours (r = 0.96), while in patients with a symptom onset of less than 4 hours, perfusion imaging provided important additional information about brain tissue with impaired perfusion.

N2  -  Introduction. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare recently-described clinical-radiological entity characterized by the combination of neurological symptoms and usually reversible neuro-images of bilateral posterior cerebral edema. The differential diagnosis with cerebral infarction can be a challenge.
Methods. A retrospective study was conducted from January 2006 to September 2010 including all cases of PRES observed in intensive care unit patients with varying predisposing conditions. Imaging findings, cerebral location and difficulty encountered with differential diagnosis were examined.; Results. The study cohort included four women and one man, mean age 30 years (range 23-44) with various predisposing conditions: cesarean section with spinal anesthesia in a context of prematurity (n = 2); cesarean section for intrauterine fetal death (n = 1); lupus nephritis (n = 1); (hypertension (n = 1). The brain computed tomography scan was unremarkable for the first two patients and showed lesions in favor of subsequent infarction in the others. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the key diagnostic element for PRES showing signal abnormalities on T2, FLAIR and diffusion sequences, with a typical parieto-occipital localization.; ConclusionDiscussion. PRES is a little-known disease. Prognosis is good with early diagnosis and proper management; imaging with MRI is the key to diagnosis. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging.
Materials and Methods: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (88), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (48), FLAIR (78), and T2-weighted image (88). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze die presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images.; Results: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (88), inferior colliculus (69), corpus callosum (28), pons (28), medulla (18), and bilateral cerebral white matter (18). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (34), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map, All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.; Conclusions: Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - The apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI has been used to differentiate reversible from irreversible ischemic injury. However, the ADC can be falsely elevated by partial volume averaging of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with parenchyma, limiting the accuracy of this approach. This study tested the hypothesis that the accuracy of differentiating reversible from irreversible ischemic injury could be improved by CSF suppression at image acquisition.
Methods - Sixteen patients presenting within 6 hours from symptoms, and having partial reversal of the acute lesion on DWI were studied using conventional CSF-suppressed DWI. Lesions were segmented from coregistered acute DWI and follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR) series. The segmented volumes were applied to conventional ( ADCC) and CSF-suppressed ADC (wADC(FLIPD)) maps to classify each voxel as progressed to infarct or reversed. Individual voxel ADC values were pooled across all patients. Sensitivity to predict reversal, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for both methods.; Results - A total of 25 313 voxels were classified as progressed and 31 952 voxels reversed. Across all lesion voxels, ADC(FLIPD) values more accurately depicted tissue fate compared with ADCC values (P < 0.0001). The largest difference in the two methods was in voxels with <75% parenchyma, where the accuracy of ADCC was only 50% compared with 62% for ADC(FLIPD).; Conclusion - CSF-suppressed ADC measurements gave a more accurate identification of reversible ischemic injury in this sample. We predict that multimodal MRI models of tissue viability in ischemic stroke will be more accurate if CSF-suppressed ADC measurements are used.

N2  -  This stroke experiment was designed to define the mismatch between perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in MRI by applying early or instantly acquired PWI. Eight rats were induced with stroke through photothrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and scanned serially between 1 h and day 3 after induction using DWI and PWI with a 1.5 T MR scanner. The relative lesion volumes (rLV) on MRI and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained specimens were defined as the proportion of lesion volume over brain volume. Discrepancies in the rLV between PWI- and DWI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were expressed by subtraction of the ADC from PWI, resulting in three possible patterns: (i) (PWI-ADC > 10% of PWI) denoting a mismatch; (ii) (-(10% of PWI) <= PWI-ADC <= 10% of PWI) denoting a match; and (iii) (PWI-ADC < -(10% of PWI)) denoting a reverse mismatch. The differences were compared with the minuend being either early PWI (ePWI) or instant PWI (iPWI) and the subtrahend being instant ADC (iADC). The occurrence and evolution of PWI-ADC patterns were analysed. Over time, PWI-ADC discrepancies evolved from,mismatch, through to match, to reversed mismatch. The PWI-ADC mismatch still existed 3 days after MCA occlusion in one to three of the eight cases. The rLVs and mismatch incidences between the ePWI-iADC and iPWI-iADC models were linear correlated. A higher mismatch rate occurred in iPWI-iADC within day 1 and in ePWI-iADC at day 3. Both ePWI and iPWI proved useful to define PWI-ADC patterns within day 1. At day 3, iPWI appeared more adequate.

N2  -  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used as a non-invasive method for the evaluation of pre-operation motor function. However, patients with cortical function impairment, such as those with hemiparesis, can rarely achieve hand clenching, a typical fMRI task for central sulcus identification, and the method is also of limited use in uncooperative children. Thus, it is important to develop a new method for identifying primary motor areas (PMA) in such individuals. This study used corticospinal tractography to identify the PMA in 20 patients with deep-seated brain tumor. Two regions of interest were set within the brainstem for corticospinal tract (CST) fiber tracking: one at the level of the pons and the other at the level of the cerebral peduncle. The CST fiber tracking results and fMRI activation signals were merged with three-dimensional anatomic MRI findings. The consistency of identifying the PMA by CST and fMRI was analyzed. fMRI activation signals were distributed mainly in the contralateral central sulcus around the omega-shaped hand knob. The CST consistently propagated from the pons and cerebral peduncle to the suspected PMA location. There was a good correlation between CST fiber tracking results and fMRI activation signals in terms of their abilities to identify the PMA. The differences between fMRI and CST fiber tracking findings may result from our functional task, which consisted only of hand movements. Our results indicate that diffusion tensor imaging is a useful brain mapping technique for identifying the PMA in paralyzed patients and uncooperative children.

N2  -  The evaluation of therapeutic response using cross-sectional imaging techniques, particularly gadolinium-enhanced MRI, is an integral part of the clinical management of brain tumors in veterinary patients. Spontaneous canine brain tumors are increasingly recognized and utilized as a translational model for the study of human brain tumors. However, no standardized neuroimaging response assessment criteria have been formulated for use in veterinary clinical trials. Previous studies have found that the pathophysiologic features inherent to brain tumors and the surrounding brain complicate the use of the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) assessment system. Objectives of this review are to describe strengths and limitations of published imaging-based brain tumor response criteria and propose a system for use in veterinary patients. The widely used human Macdonald and response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria are reviewed and described as to how they can be applied to veterinary brain tumors. Discussion points will include current challenges associated with the interpretation of brain tumor therapeutic responses such as imaging pseudophenomena and treatment-induced necrosis, and how advancements in perfusion imaging, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown promise in differentiating tumor progression from therapy-induced changes. Finally, although objective endpoints such as MR imaging and survival estimates will likely continue to comprise the foundations for outcome measures in veterinary brain tumor clinical trials, we propose that in order to provide a more relevant therapeutic response metric for veterinary patients, composite response systems should be formulated and validated that combine imaging and clinical assessment criteria.

N2  -  Owing to its rapid acquisition time and high sensitivity, diffusion-weighted imaging has turned into a routine sequence for brain imaging. This is the case not only for stroke, but also for various diseases such as abscesses or tumors. Being aware of the artifacts is important for optimal interpretation. After a brief review of the normal patterns, the most frequent artifacts, inherent to the echoplanar imaging technique, are described and we provide suggestions to avoid them. Most current traps are caused by T2-weighting of the diffusion images; the key for avoiding erroneous interpretation relies on the ADC map.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Differentiating sellar region meningiomas from pituitary adenomas on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences can be difficult. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive technique of magnetic resonance perfusion imaging. The range of applications of ASL in neurosurgery has increased, and the information provided can be unique and complementary to other MRI sequences. Here we investigate the utility of ASL MRI in differentiating between sellar region meningiomas and pituitary adenomas.
METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison of quantitative assessments on absolute and normalized tumor blood flow in histologically proven meningiomas versus pituitary adenomas.; RESULTS: A total of 15 patients with sellar region lesions were identified, including 9 meningiomas and 6 pituitary adenomas. Mean absolute tumor blood flow and normalized tumor blood flow were significantly higher in meningiomas (131 mL100 gmin and 2.22) than adenomas (47 mL100 gmin and 0.92; P < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: ASL MRI is a useful adjunct sequence in differentiating sellar region meningiomas, which exhibit high perfusion, from pituitary adenomas, which exhibit relatively low perfusion.

N2  -  Objectives: To evaluate microstructural cerebral changes in children with neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) based on T-2, relaxation time measurements at 3Tesla.
Methods: From our dataset of pediatric MRI examinations at 3T 19 pediatric NE I patients (1.9-14.3 years of age, 9 girls, 10 boys) were retrospectively selected and compared with the previously published group of 44 healthy children (0-16 years of age). MRI examination included a triple echo TSE sequence as basis for T-2 maps. T, relaxation times were measured in 37 brain regions.; Results: Compared with healthy controls, T, relaxation times had the tendency to be increased by 1.01% (GM) to 11.85% (dentate nucleus) for NE I patients. Only in posterior limb of the internal capsule and parietooccipital white matter values were reduced. No differences were observed between both hemispheres. Overall, no strong evidence supporting a difference between NFI patients with and without optic glioma or with normal and impaired neuropsychological development was observed.; Conclusions: Using T, relaxation times it was possible to describe measurable microstructural differences in multiple brain regions between NFl patients and healthy children regardless of whether signal abnormalities were visible on conventional images.

N2  -  Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is known to have poor prognosis, with no available imaging marker that can predict survival at the time of diagnosis. Diffusion weighted images are used in characterisation of cellularity and necrosis of GBM. The purpose of this study was to assess whether pattern or degree of diffusion restriction could help in the prognostication of patients with GBM. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 84 consecutive patients with confirmed GBM on biopsy or resection. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The total volume of the tumor and total volume of tumor showing restricted diffusion were calculated. The lowest Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) in the region of the tumor and in the contralateral Normal Appearing White Matter were calculated in order to calculate the nADC. Treatment and follow-up data in these patients were recorded. Multivariate analsysis was completed to determine significant correlations between different variables and the survival of these patients. Results: Patient survival was significantly related to the age of the patient (p<0.0001; 95% CI-1.022-1.043) and the nADC value (p=0.014; 95% CI-0.269-0.860) in the tumor. The correlation coefficients of age and nADC with survival were -0.335 (p=0.002) and 0.390 (p<0.001), respectively. Kaplan Meier survival function, grouped by normalized Apparent Diffusion Coefficient cut off value of 0.75, was significant (p=0.007). Conclusion: The survival of patients with GBM had small, but significant, correlations with the patient's age and nADC within the tumor.

N2  -  A 37-year-old man came to our neurosurgical department with a 2-month history of a progressive invalidating balance disorder. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging found a T2-weighted hypersignal lesion of the right cerebellopontine angle that severely compressed the brainstem, however the position of cranial nerves was not clearly identified. The new MRI diffusion tool, tractography, allowed to reconstruct the trajectory of cranial nerves that were displaced by the tumor. As such, the acoustic facial bundle was severely flattened posteriorly and superiorly, while the lower nerves were pushed inferiorly. Effective neurosurgical decompression was performed and confirmed the position of cranial nerves VLXII. The patient was discharged and returned home without any cranial nerve deficit. This case illustrates how advances in imaging can now better describe the anatomy surrounding brain tumors and make surgery safer to the benefit of patients.

N2  -  In this paper we report our experience with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for optic radiation (OR) visualization during resection of tumors. We hypothesize that intraoperative OR visualization helps to maintain patients visual fields. DWI studies were performed together with T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in four patients with lesions in or adjacent to the OR (glioblastoma, oligo-astrocytoma, cavernoma, and metastasis; n=1 each). The OR was identified from one of six DWI data acquisitions, segmented and reconstructed three-dimensionally. The image data were neuronavigationally transferred into the operative field, and provided the neurosurgeon with information on lesion site and adjacent OR localization. Preoperative and postoperative neuroophthalmological testing included, among others, perimetry to define the value of diffusion-weighted image guidance during OR lesion resection. Three lesions were removed completely. In one case, low-grade tumor parts infiltrating the OR were intentionally left. No persistent visual field deficits were induced. In one patient, a transient homonymous hemianopia attributable to postoperative swelling completely resolved under steroid medication. The authors conclude that intraoperative OR visualization, realized by neuronavigationally displayed DWI data, might prove to be helpful to maintain patients visual fields.

N2  -  Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been widely used to better visualize disease in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised safety concerns about the use of GBCAs. Therefore, the development of novel approaches that can decrease or even eliminate GBCA exposure while providing similar contrast information would be of significant use clinically. Methods: In this work, we present a deep learning based approach for contrast-enhanced T1 synthesis on brain tumor patients. A 3D high-resolution fully convolutional network (FCN), which maintains high resolution information through processing and aggregates multi-scale information in parallel, is designed to map pre-contrast MRI sequences to contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. Specifically, three pre-contrast MRI sequences, T1, T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC), are utilized as inputs and the post-contrast T1 sequences are utilized as target output. To alleviate the data imbalance problem between normal tissues and the tumor regions, we introduce a local loss to improve the contribution of the tumor regions, which leads to better enhancement results on tumors. Results: Extensive quantitative and visual assessments are performed, with our proposed model achieving a PSNR of 28.24 dB in the brain and 21.2 dB in tumor regions. Conclusion and Significance: Our results suggest the potential of substituting GBCAs with synthetic contrast images generated via deep learning.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-There is ample evidence that in anterior circulation stroke, the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion may escape infarction and thus is not a reliable infarct predictor. In this study, we assessed the predictive value of the mean transit time (MTT) for final infarction within the DWI lesion, first in patients scanned back-to-back with (15)O-positron emission tomography and MR (DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging; "Cambridge sample") within 7 to 21 hours of clinical onset, then in a large sample of patients with anterior circulation stroke receiving DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging within 12 hours (85% within 6 hours; "I-KNOW sample").
Methods-Both samples underwent structural MRI at approximately 1 month to map final infarcts. For both imaging modalities, MTT was calculated as cerebral blood volumecerebral blood flow. After image coregistration and matrix resampling, the MTT values between voxels of interest that later infarcted or not were compared separately within and outside DWI lesions (DWI+ and DWI-, respectively) both within and across patients. In the I-KNOW sample, receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for these voxel of interest populations and areas under the curve and optimal thresholds calculated.; Results-In the Cambridge data set (n = 4), there was good concordance between predictive values of MTT(positron emission) (tomography) and MTT(perfusion-weighted) (imaging) for both DWI+ and DWI- voxels of interest indicating adequate reliability of MTT(perfusion-weighted imaging) for this purpose. In the I-KNOW data set (N = 42), the MTT significantly added to the DWI lesion to predict infarction in both DWI+ and DWI- voxels of interest with areas under the curve approximately 0.78 and 0.64 (both P < 0.001) and optimal thresholds approximately 8 seconds and 11 seconds, respectively.; Conclusions-Despite the relatively small samples, this study suggests that adding MTT(perfusion-weighted imaging) may improve infarct prediction not only as already known outside, but also within, DWI lesions.

N2  -  Purpose of review
Time from symptom onset to treatment is considered to be the key variable that influences the indication of recanalization therapy for treatment of acute brain infarction. Symptom duration less than 24 h defines transient ischemic attack (TIA). The evolution of multimodal brain MRI demonstrates that neuroimaging findings of tissue injury may be more important predictors of clinical outcomes than arbitrary time thresholds.; Recent findings; Preliminaries studies suggest that stroke victims with a significant penumbra estimated by the diffusionperfusion mismatch on MRI benefit from thrombolysis beyond the currently recommended time window of 4.5 h. New software programs can automatically produce reliable perfusion and diffusion maps for use in clinical practice. Combined diffusion and perfusion MRI reveals an acute ischemic lesion in about 60% of TIA patients. Patients with transient symptoms and a restricted diffusion lesion on MRI are considered by the American Heart Association (AHA) scientific committee to have suffered a brain infarction and have a very high risk of early stroke recurrence.; Summary; Multimodal MRI provides critical real-time information about ongoing tissue injury as well as the risk of additional ischemic damage. It is becoming an essential tool for the diagnosis, management and triage of acute TIA and brain infarction.

N2  -  BackgroundAdvancements in hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MR) systems allow for combining the advantages of each modality. Integrating information from MRI and PET can be valuable for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. However, combining diffusion MRI (dMRI) and PET data, which provide highly complementary information, has rarely been exploited in image post-processing. dMRI has the ability to investigate the white matter pathways of the brain through fibre tractography, which enables comprehensive mapping of the brain connection networks (the "connectome"). Novel methods are required to combine information present in the connectome and PET to increase the full potential of PET-MRI. MethodsWe developed a CONNectome-based Non-Local Means (CONN-NLM) filter to exploit synergies between dMRI-derived structural connectivity and PET intensity information to denoise PET images. PET-MR data are parcelled into a number of regions based on a brain atlas, and the inter-regional structural connectivity is calculated based on dMRI fibre-tracking. The CONN-NLM filter is then implemented as a post-reconstruction filter by combining the nonlocal means filter and a connectivity-based cortical smoothing. The effect of this approach is to weight voxels with similar PET intensity and highly connected voxels higher when computing the weighted-average to perform more informative denoising. The proposed method was first evaluated using a novel computer phantom framework to simulate realistic hybrid PET-MR images with different lesion scenarios. CONN-NLM was further assessed with clinical dMRI and tau PET examples. ResultsThe results showed that CONN-NLM has the capacity to improve the overall PET image quality by reducing noise while preserving lesion contrasts, and it outperformed a range of filters that did not use dMRI information. The simulations demonstrate that CONN-NLM can handle various lesion contrasts consistently, as well as lesions with different levels of inter-connectivity. ConclusionCONN-NLM has unique advantages of providing more informative and accurate PET smoothing by adding complementary structural connectivity information from dMRI, representing a new avenue to exploit synergies between MRI and PET.

N2  -  Neurosurgeons rely on image-guidance to perform safe, successful surgery efficiently and cost-effectively. Neuronavigation involves rigid frame-based or fiducial-based frameless stereotactic guidance that derives its accuracy from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This imaging can be obtained days or immediately before surgery. Fundamentally, however these systems do not address the brain shift that results from the loss of cerebrospinal fluid once the cranium is opened. Intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) systems were developed in part to compensate for such brain shift during surgery. Like its predecessors, ioMRI affords excellent soft tissue discrimination and the ability to view the surgical site in three dimensions. Moreover, as all of these approaches use CT or MR imaging, being able to view the tumor being biopsied or resected allows the surgeon to preoperatively determine a surgical corridor that avoids critical structures. However, unlike its predecessor, ioMRI also allows the surgeon to see in real-time what the surgery has accomplished, allowing the surgeon to revisit the surgical field to exclude the presence of intraoperative hemorrhage. Although all ioMRI systems offer T1- and T2-weighted imaging, only high-field (>= 1.5 Tesla) systems are routinely capable of MR spectroscopy (MRS), MR angiography (MRA), MR venography (MRV), diffusion-and susceptibility-weighted imaging, as well as ultrastructural (diffusion and fiber tracking) and physiologic imaging by means of MR perfusion and brain activation (fMRI) studies. Identifying vascular structures with MRA and MRV may prevent their injury during surgery. Biopsying areas of elevated phosphocholine on MRS may improve the diagnostic yield for brain biopsy. Locating brain function may affect the surgical path chosen to biopsy or resect a tumor. Despite these advantages, however, there remains debate over the optimal field strength and configuration for an ioMRI-guided system.

N2  -  Rationale and Objective. To assess the value of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pediatric and adolescent tumor patients with focus on detection and delineation of malignant tumors of the central nervous system, chest, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system.
Materials and Methods. Twenty-nine pediatric and adolescent patients (17 males, 12 females, age, 2 months-20 years, mean age: 8.9 years) with clinically suspected malignant tumors were examined with use of a 1.5-T MR scanner with open bore design without sedation or general anesthesia. DWI images were acquired with a single-shot echo planar imaging, (EPI) sequence in free breathing with b-values of 0, 500, and 1000 mms(2). Images were assessed by two readers in consensus. Artifacts in DWI were graded as not relevant, acceptable, or nondiagnostic. DWIapparent diffusion coefficient maps were correlated with T1-weighted post-contrast images, and the detectability and correct delineation of the tumors were graded using a three grade scale.; Results. Free-breathing DWI was successfully performed in all patients. In 27 patients, no relevant artifacts were observed; acceptable artifacts were seen in two patients. In all patients, malignancies were detected both on DWI and T1-weighted gadolinium images. Detection and delineation of tumors were possible in all cases with both sequences; T1-weighted gadolinium imaging was superior to DWI in only three patients. Additionally, small diffusion restricted lymph nodes were detected in three patients.; Conclusion. DWI is reliable for the accurate detection and delineation of malignant pediatric and adolescent tumors.

N2  -  Quantitative mapping of hyperperfused and hypercellular regions of glioblastoma has been proposed to improve definition of tumor regions at risk for local recurrence following conventional radiation therapy. As the processing of the multiparametric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) and diffusion-weighted (DW-) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for delineation of these subvolumes requires additional steps that go beyond the standard practices of target definition, we sought to devise a workflow to support the timely planning and treatment of patients. A phase II study implementing a multiparametric imaging biomarker for tumor hyperperfusion and hypercellularity consisting of DCE-MRI and high b-value DW-MRI to guide intensified (75 Gy/30 fractions) radiation therapy (RT) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma was launched. In this report, the workflow and the initial imaging outcomes of the first 12 patients are described. Among all the first 12 patients, treatment was initiated within 6 weeks of surgery and within 2 weeks of simulation. On average, the combined hypercellular volume and high cerebral blood volume/tumor perfusion volume were 1.8 times smaller than the T1 gadolinium abnormality and 10 times smaller than the FLAIR abnormality. Hypercellular volume and high cerebral blood volume/tumor perfusion volume each identified largely distinct regions and showed 57% overlap with the enhancing abnormality, and minimal-to-no extension outside of the FLAIR. These results show the feasibility of implementing a workflow for multiparametric magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy into clinical trials with a coordinated multidisciplinary team, and the unique and complementary tumor subregions identified by the combination of high b-value DW-MRI and DCE-MRI.

N2  -  Objectives: We studied patients managed by active surveillance to determine whether there was a difference over time in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI in those who progressed to radical treatment (progressors, n=17) compared with those who did not (non-progressors, n=33).
Methods: 50 consecutive patients (Stage T12a, Gleason grade <= 3+4, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <15 ng ml(-1), <50% cores positive) were imaged endorectally (baseline and 1-3 years follow-up) with T-2 weighted (T2W) and echo-planar diffusion-weighted MRI sequences. Regions of interest drawn on ADC maps with reference to the T2W images yielded AD(Call) (b=0-800), ADC(fast) (b=0-300) and ADC(slow) (b=300-800) for whole prostate (minus tumour) and tumour (low signal-intensity peripheral zone lesion in biopsy-positive octant).; Results: Tumour and whole prostate ADC(all) and ADC(fast) were significantly reduced over time in progressors (p=0.03 and 0.03 for tumours, respectively; p=0.02 and 0.007 for the whole prostate, respectively). There were no significant changes in ADC over time in non-progressors. A 10% reduction in tumour ADC(all) indicated progression with a 93% sensitivity and 40% specificity (A(z) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.68). Percentage reductions in whole prostate ADC(all), ADC(fast) and ADC(slow) were also significantly greater in progressors than in non-progressors (p=0.01, 0.03 and 0.008, respectively).; Conclusion: This pilot study shows that DW-MRI has potential for monitoring patients with early prostate cancer who opt for active surveillance.

N2  -  Solid tumor microstructure is related to the aggressiveness of the tumor, interstitial pressure and drug delivery pathways, which are closely associated with treatment response, metastatic spread and prognosis. In this study, we introduce a novel diffusion MRI data analysis framework, pulsed and oscillating gradient MRI for assessment of cell size and extracellular space (POMACE), and demonstrate its feasibility in a mouse tumor model.
In vivo and ex vivo POMACE experiments were performed on mice bearing the GL261 murine glioma model (n = 8). Since the complete diffusion time dependence is in general non-analytical, the tumor microstructure was modeled in an appropriate timefrequency regime by impermeable spheres (radius R-cell, intracellular diffusivity D-ics) surrounded by extracellular space (ECS) (approximated by constant apparent diffusivity D-ecs in volume fraction ECS). POMACE parametric maps (ECS, R-cell, D-ics, D-ecs) were compared with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging metrics, electron microscopy (EM), alternative ECS determination based on effective medium theory (EMT), and optical microscopy performed on the same samples.; It was shown that D-ecs can be approximated by its long time tortuosity limit in the range 1(88 Hz)-31 ms. ECS estimations (44 +- 7% in vivo and 54 +- 11% ex vivo) were in agreement with EMT-based ECS and literature on brain gliomas. Ex vivo, ECS maps correlated well with optical microscopy. Cell sizes (R-cell = 4.8 +- 1.3 in vivo and 4.3 +- 1.4 mu m ex vivo) were consistent with EM measurements (4.7 +- 1.8 mu m).; In conclusion, R-cell and ECS can be quantified and mapped in vivo and ex vivo in brain tumors using the proposed POMACE method. Our experimental results support the view that POMACE provides a way to interpret the frequency or time dependence of the diffusion coefficient in tumors in terms of objective biophysical parameters of neuronal tissue, which can be used for non-invasive monitoring of preclinical cancer studies and treatment efficacy.

N2  -  Sport concussion is associated with disturbances in brain function in the absence of gross anatomical lesions, and may have long-term health consequences. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods provide a powerful tool for investigating alterations in white matter microstructure reflecting the long-term effects of concussion. In a previous study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed that athletes with a history of concussion had elevated fractional anisotropy (FA) and reduced mean diffusivity (MD) parameters. To better understand these effects, this study compared DTI results to neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), which was used to estimate the intracellular volume fraction (V-IC) and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Sixty-eight (68) varsity athletes were recruited, including 37 without a history of concussion and 31 with concussion >6 months prior to imaging. Univariate analyses showed elevated FA and decreased MD for concussed athletes, along with increased V-IC and reduced ODI, indicating greater neurite density and coherence of neurite orientation within white matter. Multivariate analyses also showed that for athletes with a history of concussion, white matter regions with increased FA had increased V-IC and decreased ODI, with greater effects among athletes who were imaged a longer time since their last concussion. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between the biophysics of water diffusion and concussion neurobiology for young, healthy adults. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4201-4211, 2017.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI has been used worldwide to produce images of brain tissue structure and connectivity, in the normal and diseased brain. Diffusion MRI has revolutionized the management of acute brain ischemia (stroke), saving life of many patients and sparing them significant disabilities. In addition to stroke, diffusion MRI is now widely used for the detection of cancers and metastases (breast, prostate, liver). Another major field of application of diffusion MRI regards the wiring of the brain. Diffusion MRI is now used to map the circuitry of the human brain with incredible accuracy, opening up new lines of inquiry for human neuroscience and for the understanding of brain illnesses or mental disorders. Here, as a pioneer of the field, I provide a personal account on the historical development of these concepts over the last 30years.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to identify and assess visual field defects caused by primary damage to the optic radiation in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Ten individuals with spastic CP (six females, four males, with a median age of 21 years [range 17-38y]) had their brain lesions documented with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI fibre tractography. Their macular ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) were examined with OCT and their visual fields were plotted. All participants had good visual acuity and were able to cooperate with the MRI and OCT examinations, as well as undergoing reliable perimetry. We found focal thinning of the GCL+IPL and corresponding homonymous visual field defects in individuals with brain damage affecting the optic radiation. We used GCL+IPL sector asymmetry as a sensitive OCT parameter to identify focal visual field defects. We observed no such sector asymmetry in GCL+IPL, or focal visual field defects, in individuals with normal MRI optic radiation imaging. Lesions affecting the optic radiation cause retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. OCT examination of the GCL in the macula identified corresponding focal damage to the optic radiation in individuals with spastic CP and can be used to predict focal visual field defects.
What this paper adds; Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) may be associated with damage to the optic radiation.; Damage to the optic radiation causes retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration (RTSD).; RTSD can be mapped using optical coherence tomography.; Ganglion cell topography can predict visual field defects in individuals with spastic CP.

N2  -  Hypoperfusion following acute stroke is common in the infarct core and periphery tissues. The present study evaluated the efficacy of salvianolic acid (SA) on the cerebral perfusion of patients who had suffered from acute stroke using perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) to examine the blood perfusion of the affected brain tissue prior to and following treatment. Patients who were admitted to PLA 153 Central Hospital within 72 h of acute stroke symptom onset and had a Glasgow coma scale 5 were randomized into two groups: SA and control groups. Patients in the SA group were administered SA 0.13 g/day for 14 days. PWI was performed for all patients at admission and post-treatment. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were applied to assess neurological function at admission and 3 months post treatment. A total of 159 patients were enrolled (85 patients in the SA group and 74 patients in the control group). A total of 62 patients in the SA group and 51 patients in the control group exhibited hypoperfusion in the ipsihemisphere of the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) lesion. In addition, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), a ratio of the signal value of the region of interest in the same hemisphere of the DWI lesion to that of its mirror in the PWI CBV map, decreased significantly following treatment with SA compared with the control group in patients with hypoperfusion (P=0.02), which were indicated by PWI images at admission, in the DWI lesions or the surrounding areas. Additionally, there was no significant difference in patients with normal perfusion at admission in rCBV in DWI lesions or its surrounding area between the two groups at day 15. However, a significant improvement in NIHSS (P=0.001) and mRS (P=0.005) was indicated in the SA group compared with the control at day 90. The present study indicated that SA may improve the neurological dysfunction of patients with acute stroke, which may be explained by the increased perfusion of hypoperfused brain tissues.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) in imaging of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
Methods: Eighteen patients with single-site extrapulmonary tuberculosis were evaluated with contrast-enhanced dedicated MRI of the clinically symptomatic site followed by WB-MRI using contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional (3D) modified DIXON technique (m-DIXON) and diffusion-weighted WB imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) sequences. Studies were read by 2 experienced radiologists, and additional lesions seen on WB-MRI were separately charted.; Results: Of 18 patients, 14 were found to have asymptomatic involvement of other organs on WB-MRI. In 5 patients, the information was helpful in choosing an easily accessible site for biopsyaspiration. Postcontrast 3D m-DIXON was better in picking up brain and lymph nodal lesions, whereas DWIBS was better in detecting vertebral lesions.; Conclusions: Whole-body MRI may be used for assessing the asymptomatic involvement of other body organs in tuberculosis. The combination of postcontrast 3D m-DIXON and DWIBS is complementary and may provide a road map for biopsy of accessible lesions.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in tracking tumor growth and response to treatment. However, studies using these measures may lack statistical power to draw definitive conclusions regarding changes in tumor cellularity. Using apparent diffusion coefficient values taken from the literature, the investigators estimated sample sizes for a range of changes to the mean.
Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed of studies measuring the average apparent diffusion coefficients for various bodily tissues, and the mean and standard deviation from each study were recorded. Analyses of statistical power were then performed using these values and comparing them to a population of healthy controls.; Results: Tumor cellularity as measured by apparent diffusion coefficients may have high sensitivity, but the analyses indicate that investigations in this field may potentially suffer from low statistical power. For example, the findings indicate that samples of <20 patients may require a mean change of approximately 25% between study conditions.; Conclusions: Suggestions are offered for improvements in methodologic approaches and in data reporting to assist in overcoming the limitations of small sample sizes. On the basis of this literature review, reference values are provided to help investigators estimate study sample size to achieve adequate statistical power.

N2  -  Background: Advances in magnetic resonance imaging and the introduction of clinical decision support systems has underlined the need for an analysis tool to extract and analyze relevant information from magnetic resonance imaging data to aid decision making, prevent errors, and enhance health care.
Objective: The aim of this study was to design and develop a modular medical image region of interest analysis tool and repository (MIROR) for automatic processing, classification, evaluation, and representation of advanced magnetic resonance imaging data.; Methods: The clinical decision support system was developed and evaluated for diffusion-weighted imaging of body tumors in children (cohort of 48 children, with 37 malignant and 11 benign tumors). Mevislab software and Python have been used for the development of MIROR. Regions of interests were drawn around benign and malignant body tumors on different diffusion parametric maps, and extracted information was used to discriminate the malignant tumors from benign tumors.; Results: Using MIROR, the various histogram parameters derived for each tumor case when compared with the information in the repository provided additional information for tumor characterization and facilitated the discrimination between benign and malignant tumors. Clinical decision support system cross-validation showed high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between these tumor groups using histogram parameters.; Conclusions: MIROR, as a diagnostic tool and repository, allowed the interpretation and analysis of magnetic resonance imaging images to be more accessible and comprehensive for clinicians. It aims to increase clinicians' skillset by introducing newer techniques and up-to-date findings to their repertoire and make information from previous cases available to aid decision making. The modular-based format of the tool allows integration of analyses that are not readily available clinically and streamlines the future developments.

N2  -  In relation to the adult brain, the immature brain might be more vulnerable to damage during and following traumatic brain iujury, particularly in white-matter tracts. Given well-established evidence of corpus callosum atrophy, we hypothesized that anterior commissure volume (using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in this structure would be decreased in children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury relative to typically developing children. Second, given the purported role of the anterior commissure in interhemispheric axon conveyance between temporal lobes, we hypothesized that temporal lobe white matter, temporal lesion volume, and injury severity (Glasgow Coma Scale score) would be predictive of decreased anterior commissure cross-sectional volume in patients with traumatic brain injury. Finally, we wished to establish the relationship between the anterior commissure and the temporal stem, a major white-matter tract into the temporal lobes, using diffusion tensor imaging fiber-tracking maps for each patient. We also hypothesized that children with traumatic brain injury would exhibit decreased fractional anisotropy in relation to typically developing children in a fiber system including the anterior commissure and the temporal lobes. Decreased anterior commissure cross-sectional volume was observed in patients with traumatic brain injury, and, as predicted, anterior commissure and temporal white-matter volumes were positively related to each other and to higher Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Lesion volume was not independently predictive of anterior commissure volume in the overall model. Diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy values differed between the groups for the temporal stem-anterior commissure system, with the traumatic brain injury group exhibiting decreased fractional anisotropy. The anterior commissure, like the corpus callosum, appears to be highly vulnerable to white-matter degenerative changes resulting from mechanisms such as the direct impact of trauma, progressive axonal injury as tissue in other brain regions atrophies, or myelin degeneration. This is the first systematic examination of anterior commissure atrophy following traumatic brain injury using in vivo quantitative MRI and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking in pediatric subjects.

N2  -  The quantitative assessment of the anatomic consequences of cerebral infarction is critical in the study of the etiology and therapeutic response in patients with stroke. We present here an overview of the operation of "WebParc,'' a computational system that provides measures of stroke lesion volume and location with respect to canonical forebrain neural systems nomenclature. Using a web-based interface, clinical imaging data can be registered to a template brain that contains a comprehensive set of anatomic structures. Upon delineation of the lesion, we can express the size and localization of the lesion in terms of the regions that are intersected within the template. We demonstrate the application of the system using MRI-based diffusion-weighted imaging and document measures of the validity and reliability of its uses. Intra- and inter-rater reliability is demonstrated, and characterized relative to the various classes of anatomic regions that can be assessed. The WebParc system has been developed to meet criteria of both efficiency and intuitive operator use in the real time analysis of stroke anatomy, so as to be useful in support of clinical care and clinical research studies. This article is an overview of its base-line operation with quantitative anatomic characterization of lesion size and location in terms of stroke distribution within the separate gray and white matter compartments of the brain.

N2  -  This article presents a warping technique for correcting brain tissue distortion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans due to stroke lesion growth and for mapping MRI scans to histological sections. Meshes are imposed upon the images for feature specification, and these features are exactly matched in the different images to be mapped, while the other voxels are matched by interpolation. This technique was tested on serial MR images and histological sections that were acquired in a nonhuman primate model of stroke. This technique was able to deliver satisfactory warping results. It is simple and robust and can be utilized in many applications for comparison of multimodality medical images and histological sections. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The optimal surgical management of gliomas requires a balance between surgical cytoreduction and preservation of neurological function. Preoperative functional neuroimaging, such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has emerged as a possible tool to inform patient selection and surgical planning. However, evidence that preoperative fMRI or DTI improves extent of resection, limits neurological morbidity, and broadens surgical indications in classically eloquent areas is lacking. In this review, the authors describe facets of functional neuroimaging techniques that may limit their impact on neurosurgical oncology and critically evaluate the evidence supporting fMRI and DTI for patient selection and operative planning in glioma surgery. The authors also propose alternative applications for functional neuroimaging in the care of glioma patients.

N2  -  T-1 relaxation time (T-1) is a quantitative magnetic resonance measure that enables a global evaluation of white matter disease in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to investigate whether mapping of T-1 values in critical white matter tracts, defined by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging, could provide a stronger surrogate marker of disability. 25 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 healthy controls were imaged with a dual-echo T-2-weighted sequence. Whole brain T-1 maps were acquired using a multi-slice inversion recovery sequence and DT images generated from a spin-echo, echo-planar diffusion weighted sequence. Trajectories were defined to follow the course of white matter fibre tracts in the pyramidal pathways and corpus callosum. T-1 values were sampled along these trajectories. Total white matter T-1 was sampled by defining white matter masks on axial slices of the T-1 maps. Median T-1 in the pyramidal tracts, corpus callosum and total white matter of MS patients was significantly longer than in controls (p < 0.0001). Median pyramidal tract T-1 correlated significantly with the pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems Score (r = 0.64, p = 0.0007) and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (r = 0.55, p = 0.005). By contrast, no correlation with disability was observed for corpus callosum T-1 or total white matter T-1. Our findings show that quantifying pathology within the pyramidal tracts, by utilizing T-1, provides a strong correlate of disability compared with the overall white matter burden of disease. Pyramidal tract T-1 may also provide an objective, sensitive measure for monitoring the progression of motor deficits and disability.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The consistency of meningioma is a factor that may influence surgical planning and the extent of resection. The aim of our study is to develop a predictive model of tumor consistency using the radiomic features of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and the tumor elasticity measured by intraoperative ultrasound elastography (IOUS-E) as a reference parameter.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on supratentorial meningiomas that were operated on between March 2018 and July 2020. Cases with IOUS-E studies were included. A semiquantitative analysis of elastograms was used to define the meningioma consistency. MRIs were preprocessed before extracting radiomic features. Predictive models were built using a combination of feature selection filters and machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. A stratified 5-fold cross-validation was performed. Then, models were evaluated using the area under the curve and classification accuracy.; RESULTS: Eighteen patients were available for analysis. Meningiomas were classified as hard or soft according to a mean tissue elasticity threshold of 120. The best-ranked radiomic features were obtained from T1-weighted post-contrast, apparent diffusion coefficient map, and T2-weighted images. The combination of Information Gain and ReliefF filters with the Naive Bayes algorithm resulted in an area under the curve of 0.961 and classification accuracy of 94%.; CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a high-precision classification model that is capable of predicting consistency of meningiomas based on the radiomic features in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted, T1-weighted post-contrast, and apparent diffusion coefficient map).

N2  -  Background and Purpose-We sought to study the role of MRI-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements for the prediction of lesion development in acute stroke patients.
Methods-Thirty-two patients were treated with tissue plasminogen activator. Diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted MRI, T2-weighted imaging, and MR angiography were performed before treatment (2.8+-0.9 hours after symptom onset) and on follow-up (days I and 7). CBF thresholds (12 and 22 mL100 g per minute) were applied to bolus tracking MRI maps to determine predictive cutoff levels.; Results-In 21 patients (group A), the terminal lesion volume (T2-weighted imaging) was larger than the initial DWI lesion volume (89+-93 versus 21+-38 mL). In 11 patients (group B), the terminal lesion volume was smaller than the initial DWI lesion volume (7 +- 27 versus 15 +- 29 mL). The initial DWI lesion volume did not differ between both groups. The presence of a tissue volume greater than or equal to50 mL with a CBF value less than or equal to12 mL100 g per minute was predictive for lesion enlargement to day 7 in T2-weighted imaging (positive predictive value, 0.80).; Conclusions-The presence of a tissue volume greater than or equal to50 mL with a CBF value less than or equal to12 mL100 g per minute predicts further lesion growth in hyperacute stroke patients. MRI-derived CBF values, with all their present limitations, are valuable in early estimation of prognosis of stroke patients.

N2  -  Background: Gliomas are the most common primary brain neoplasms. Misdiagnosis occurs in glioma grading due to an overlap in conventional MRI manifestations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the power of radiomic features based on multiple MRI sequences -T2-Weighted-Imaging-FLAIR (FLAIR), T1-Weighted-Imaging-Contrast-Enhanced (T1-CE), and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map - in glioma grading, and to improve the power of glioma grading by combining features.
MaterialMethods: Sixty-six patients with histopathologically proven gliomas underwent T2-FLAIR and T1WI-CE sequence scanning with some patients (n=63) also undergoing DWI scanning. A total of 114 radiomic features were derived with radiomic methods by using in-house software. All radiomic features were compared between high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs). Features with significant statistical differences were selected for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The relationships between significantly different radiomic features and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression were evaluated.; Results: A total of 8 radiomic features from 3 MRI sequences displayed significant differences between LGGs and HGGs. FLAIR GLCM Cluster Shade, T1-CE GLCM Entropy, and ADC GLCM Homogeneity were the best features to use in differentiating LGGs and HGGs in each MRI sequence. The combined feature was best able to differentiate LGGs and HGGs, which improved the accuracy of glioma grading compared to the above features in each MRI sequence. A significant correlation was found between GFAP and T1-CE GLCM Entropy, as well as between GFAP and ADC GLCM Homogeneity.; Conclusions: The combined radiomic feature had the highest efficacy in distinguishing LGGs from HGGs.

N2  -  High b-value diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables us to detect far smaller architectures, by using q-space analysis, than the resolution in conventional MRI. Average displacement, one of the q-space parameters, quantitatively reflects architecture size and is very useful in observing small changes in microstructures in vivo (e.g., neurodegeneration, tumor heterogeneity, and others). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is performed by a two-dimensional (2D) multislice method; however, due to finite slice thickness and slice gap, there is a partial-volume effect that makes it difficult to detect the net q-space signal. On the other hand, three-dimensional (3D) MRI, having the advantages of very thin slice thickness and no slice gap (contiguous slices), allows volumetric evaluation acquired in a small isotropic voxel, as compared to 2D multislice imaging. Little is known about the isotropic high-resolution 3D DWI application to q-space analysis. In this study, we have developed and implemented a high h-value 3D DWI sequence, applied q-space analysis to study the reliability of high b-value 3D DWI and obtained a microscopic analytical map with isotropic high resolution and less contamination.

N2  -  In the present work, we reported a new nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)-mediated magnetization transfer (MT) signal at around -1.6 ppm (NOE(-1.6)) in rat brain and investigated its application in the detection of acute ischemic stroke in rodent model. Using continuous wave (CW) MT sequence, the NOE(-1.6) is reliably detected in rat brain. The amplitude of this new NOE signal in rat brain was quantified using a 5-pool Lorentzian Z-spectral fitting method. Amplitudes of amide, amine, NOE at -3.5 ppm (NOE(-3.5)), as well as NOE(-1.6) were mapped using this fitting method in rat brain. Several other conventional imaging parameters (R-1, R-2, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and semi-solid pool size ratio (PSR)) were also measured. Our results show that NOE(-1.6), R-1, R-2, ADC, and APT signals from stroke lesion have significant changes at 0.5-1 h after stroke. Compared with several other imaging parameters, NOE(-1.6) shows the strongest contrast differences between stroke and contralateral normal tissues and stays consistent over time until 2 h after onset of stroke. Our results demonstrate that this new NOE(-1.6) signal in rat brain is a new potential contrast for assessment of acute stroke in vivo and might provide broad applications in the detection of other abnormal tissues.

N2  -  The present study evaluated the shift of the pyramidal tract during resection of 17 proximal intraaxial brain tumors. In each case intraoperative diffusion-weighted (iDW) magnetic resonance imaging with a motion-probing gradient applied in the anteroposterior direction was performed using a scanner with a 0.3 T vertical magnetic field. The position of the white matter bundles containing the pyramidal tract was estimated on the coronal images before and after resection of the neoplasm, and both quantitative and directional evaluation of its displacement was done. In all cases iDW imaging provided visualization of the structure of interest. The magnitude of the pyramidal tract displacement due to removal of the neoplasm varied from 0.5 to 8.7 mm (mean 4.4 +/- 2.5 mm) on the lesion side and from 0 to 3.6 mm (mean 1.3 +/- 1.1 mm) on the normal side (p < 0.001). Tumor location in regards to the pyramidal tract was significantly associated with the direction of the pyramidal tract displacement (p < 0.05). Outward shift occurred in 10 out of 13 cases of the lateral neoplasms, whereas in all 4 superomedial tumors inward shift was marked. In conclusion, the direction of the pyramidal tract displacement during resection of the proximal intraaxial brain tumors is mainly determined by position of the neoplasm, but can be unpredictable in some cases, which necessitates use of subcortical brain mapping and intraoperative imaging, particularly iDW imaging with updated neuronavigation.

N2  -  Recently, attention has been drawn toward brain imaging technology in the medical field, among which MRI plays a vital role in clinical diagnosis and lesion analysis of brain diseases. Different sequences of MR images provide more comprehensive information and help doctors to make accurate clinical diagnoses. However, their costs are particularly high. For many image-to-image synthesis methods in the medical field, supervised learning-based methods require labeled datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised learning-based generative adversarial network with adaptive normalization (AN-GAN) for synthesizing T2-weighted MR images from rapidly scanned diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MR images. In contrast to the existing methods, deep semantic information is extracted from the high-frequency information of original sequence images, which are then added to the feature map in deconvolution layers as a modality mask vector. This image fusion operation results in better feature maps and guides the training of GANs. Furthermore, to better preserve semantic information against common normalization layers, we introduce AN, a conditional normalization layer that modulates the activations using the fused feature map. Experimental results show that our method of synthesizing T2 images has a better perceptual quality and better detail than the other state-of-the-art methods.

N2  -  First language (L1) and second language (L2) processing in bilinguals is not yet fully understood, especially not when considering the non-dominant hemisphere. Ten healthy, right-handed volunteers underwent language mapping of the right hemisphere by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and an object-naming task in their L1 and L2. All elicited naming errors together, no responses, and all errors without hesitation were analyzed separately for cortical distributions of error rates (ERs: number of errors divided by the number of applied stimulations). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in ERs between the L1 and L2 for all errors (L1 20.6 +/- 14.8%, L2 15.4 +/- 11.2%), no responses (L1 13.5 +/- 10.9%, L2 9.2 +/- 10.8%), and all errors without hesitation (L1 14.4 +/- 11.2%, L2 10.8 +/- 10.0%). The areas that showed high ERs for the L1 included the dorsal precentral and middle precentral gyrus, whereas the triangular inferior frontal gyrus showed high ERs for the L2. When focusing on error distributions per single stimulation points, differences in ERs between the L1 and L2 were initially observed for stimulation within the angular and middle middle frontal gyrus, but did not withstand correction for the false discovery rate (FDR-correctedp > 0.05). In conclusion, this exploratory study shows the feasibility of rTMS to the right hemisphere for language mapping and reveals cortical areas involved in L1 and L2 processing, but has to be followed up by larger studies enrolling more homogeneous cohorts.

N2  -  Background Surgery of single cerebral metastases is standard but frequently fails to achieve local tumour control. Reliable predictors for local tumour progression and overall survival are unknown. MRI-based apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) correlate with tumour cellularity and invasion. The present study analysed a potential relation between the MRI based apparent diffusion coefficients local recurrence and outcome in patients with brain metastases. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for patients with cerebral metastases and complete surgical resection evaluated by an early postoperative MRI < 72h. Minimal ADC and mean ADC were assessed in preoperative 1,5T-MRI scans by placing regions of interests in the tumour and the peritumoural tissue. Results Analysis of the relation between ADC values, local progression and outcome was performed in 86 patients with a mean age of 59 years (range 33-83 years). Primary site was NSCLC in 37.2% of all cases. Despite complete resection 33.7% of all patients suffered from local in-brain-progression. There were no significant differences in ADC values in groups based on histology. In the present cohort, the mean ADCmin and the mean ADCmean within the metastasis did not differ significantly between patients with and without a later local in-brain progression (634 x 10(-6)vs. 661 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s and 1324 x 10(-6)vs. 1361 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s; 1100 x 10(-6)vs. 1054 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s; eachp > 0.05). Mean ADC values did not correlate significantly with PFS and OAS. Conclusion In the present study analysed ADC values had no significant impact on local in brain progression and survival parameters.

N2  -  Predicting clinical outcomes after stroke, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prediction of long-term clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke using parametric response mapping (PRM) based on perfusion MRI data. Multiparametric perfusion MRI datasets from 30 patients with chronic ischemic stroke were acquired at four-time points ranging from V2 (6 weeks) to V5 (7 months) after stroke onset. All perfusion MR parameters were analyzed using the classic whole-lesion approach and voxel-based PRM at each time point. The imaging biomarkers from each acquired MRI metric that was predictive of both neurological and functional outcomes were prospectively investigated. For predicting clinical outcomes at V5, it was identified that PRMTmax-, PRMrCBV-, and PRMrCBV+ at V3 were superior to the mean values of the corresponding maps at V3. We identified correlations between the clinical prognosis after stroke and MRI parameters, emphasizing the superiority of the PRM over the whole-lesion approach for predicting long-term clinical outcomes. This indicates that complementary information for the predictive assessment of clinical outcomes can be obtained using PRM analysis. Moreover, new insights into the heterogeneity of stroke lesions revealed by PRM can help optimize the accurate stratification of patients with stroke and guide rehabilitation.

N2  -  Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate various radiomics-based machine learning classification models using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps for differentiating between low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Methods Fifty-two glioma patients, including 18 LGGs (grade II) and 34 HGGs (grade III/IV), were examined using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance scanner. The ADC and CBF maps were obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion-weighted imaging, respectively. A total of 91 radiomic features were extracted from each of the tumor volume on the ADC and CBF maps. We constructed 4 types of machine learning classifiers based on (1) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized logistic regression (LASSO-LR), (2) random forest (RF), (3) support vector machine (SVM) with the radial basis function kernel (SVM-RBF), and (4) SVM with the linear kernel (SVM-L). A training set with 36 gliomas (70%) was used to select the important radiomic features and train each model using 5-fold cross-validation. The remaining 16 gliomas (30%) were used as a test set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the model performance. Results A radiomic feature, ADC first-order-based skewness, was selected as an important variable in all classification models. According to the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the areas under the curve of the LASSO-LR, RF, SVM-RBF, and SVM-L models for the training set were 0.965, 1.000, 0.979, and 0.969, respectively. For the test set, the areas under the curve of the LASSO-LR, RF, SVM-RBF, and SVM-L models were 0.883, 0.917, 0.717, and 0.917, respectively. All classification models showed sufficient diagnostic performance on the test set. Conclusions Radiomics-based machine learning classifiers using the quantitative ADC and CBF maps are useful for differentiating HGGs from LGGs.

N2  -  To investigate the application value of magnetic resonance diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in newborn piglets and to compare imaging and pathological results. Of 36 piglets investigated, 18 were in the experimental group and 18 in the control group. The HIBD model was established in newborn piglets by ligating the bilateral common carotid arteries and placing them into hypoxic chamber. All piglets underwent conventional MRI and DKI scans at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h postoperatively. Mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were constructed. Then, the lesions were examined using light and electron microscopy and compared with DKI images. The MD value of the lesion area gradually decreased and the MK value gradually increased in the experimental group with time. The lesion areas gradually expanded with time; MK lesions were smaller than MD lesions. Light microscopy revealed neuronal swelling in the MK- and MD-matched and mismatched regions. Electron microscopy demonstrated obvious mitochondrial swelling and autophagosomes in the MK- and MD-matched region but normal mitochondrial morphology or mild swelling in the mismatched region. DKI can accurately evaluate early ischemic-hypoxic brain injury in newborn piglets.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance brain scan in a 54-year-old man with ingravescent headache disclosed an expansive intraventricular non infiltrating process, hypointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2, without signal intensification after the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent. The lesion was studied with diffusion and perfusion sequences. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and the Signal/Time Relative Intensity curves after perfusion study were analyzed. Diffusion images confirmed the solid nature of the lesion, while perfusion images displayed the vascular proliferation within the lesion. Diffusion and perfusion sequences were helpful in suggesting the neuroradiological diagnosis of subependymoma, subsequently confirmed by pathologic testing following the neurosurgical tumour resection.

N2  -  Distinguishing between low-grade oligodendrogliomas (ODs) and astrocytomas (AC) is of interest for defining prognosis and stratifying patients to specific treatment regimens. The purpose of this study was to determine if the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion imaging can help to differentiate between newly diagnosed grade II OD and AC subtypes and to evaluate the ADC and FA values for the mixed population of oligoastrocytomas (OA). Fifty-three patients with newly diagnosed grade II gliomas were studied using a 1.5T whole body scanner (23 ODs, 16 ACs, and 14 OAs). The imaging protocol included post-gadolinium T1-weighted images,. T2-weighted images, and either three and/or six directional diffusion imaging sequence with b=1000 s/mm(2). Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed using in-house software to calculate maps of ADC and for six directional acquisitions, FA. The intensity values were normalized by values from normal appearing white matter (NAWM) to generate maps of normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC) and normalized fractional anisotropy (nFA). The hyperintense region in the T2 weighted image was defined as the T2All region. A Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed on the 25th, median, and 75th nADC and nFA among the three subtypes. Logistic regression was performed to determine how well the nADC and nFA predict subtype. Lesions diagnosed as being OD had significantly lower nADC and significantly higher nFA, compared to AC. The nADC and nFA values individually classified the data with an accuracy of 87%. Combining the two did not enhance the classification. The patients with OA had nADC and nFA values between those of OD and AC. This suggests that ADC and FA may be helpful in directing tissue sampling to the most appropriate regions for taking biopsies in order to make a definitive diagnosis.

N2  -  MRI is routinely used for diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of response to therapy for patients with glioma. Gliomas are spatially heterogeneous and infiltrative lesions that are quite variable in terms of their response to therapy. Patients classified as having low-grade histology have a median overall survival of 7 years or more, but need to be monitored carefully to make sure that their tumor does not upgrade to a more malignant phenotype. Patients with the most aggressive grade IV histology have a median overall survival of 12-15 months and often undergo multiple surgeries and adjuvant therapies in an attempt to control their disease. Despite improvements in the spatial resolution and sensitivity of anatomic images, there remain considerable ambiguities in the interpretation of changes in the size of the gadolinium-enhancing lesion on T-1-weighted images as a measure of treatment response, and in differentiating between treatment effects and infiltrating tumor within the larger T-2 lesion. The planning of focal therapies, such as surgery, radiation and targeted drug delivery, as well as a more reliable assessment of the response to therapy, would benefit considerably from the integration of metabolic and physiological imaging techniques into routine clinical MR examinations. Advanced methods that have been shown to provide valuable data for patients with glioma are diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopic imaging. Multiparametric examinations that include the acquisition of such data are able to assess tumor cellularity, hypoxia, disruption of normal tissue architecture, changes in vascular density and vessel permeability, in addition to the standard measures of changes in the volume of enhancing and nonenhancing anatomic lesions. This is particularly critical for the interpretation of the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of novel therapies, which are increasingly including agents that are designed to have anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative properties as opposed to having a direct effect on tumor cell viability.

N2  -  Glioblastoma (GBM) stands as the most prevalent and lethal malignant brain tumor, characterized by its highly infiltrative nature. This study aimed to identify additional MRI and metabolomic biomarkers of GBM and its impact on healthy tissue using an advanced-stage C6 glioma rat model. Wistar rats underwent a stereotactic injection of C6 cells (GBM group, n = 10) or cell medium (sham group, n = 4). A multiparametric MRI, including anatomical T2W and T1W images, relaxometry maps (T2, T2*, and T1), the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), was performed. Additionally, ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) HRMAS spectra were acquired. The MRI analysis revealed significant differences in the T2 maps, T1 maps, MTR, and mean diffusivity parameters between the GBM tumor and the rest of the studied regions, which were the contralateral areas of the GBM rats and both regions of the sham rats (the ipsilateral and contralateral). The ex vivo spectra revealed markers of neuronal loss, apoptosis, and higher glucose uptake by the tumor. Notably, the myo-inositol and phosphocholine levels were elevated in both the tumor and the contralateral regions of the GBM rats compared to the sham rats, suggesting the effects of the tumor on the healthy tissue. The MRI parameters related to inflammation, cellularity, and tissue integrity, along with MRS-detected metabolites, serve as potential biomarkers for the tumor evolution, treatment response, and impact on healthy tissue. These techniques can be potent tools for evaluating new drugs and treatment targets.

N2  -  Distinct from signal alterations in diffusion-weighted images, T-2-values are also dependent on tissue water content and known to increase with time from symptom onset in acute ischaemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a detectable increase of T-2-values in different regions in acute ischaemic stroke in the acute and subacute situation and to study the effect of recanalization on the evaluation of T-2-values in the subacute phase. In addition, we sought to evaluate whether this increase in T-2-values is reversible. For this purpose, 22 patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery underwent magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery to determine final infarct size, time-of-flight-angiography (acute and on day 1 or 2) and a triple echo-T-2-sequence (calculation of T-2 maps) within 6 h after symptom onset. Images were co-registered and regions of diffusion restriction and prolonged time-to-peak as well as surviving tissue (surviving tissue = time-to-peak - final infarct size) and lesion growth (lesion growth = final infarct size-diffusion restriction) were defined and superimposed onto the quantitative T-2 map. In addition, patients were dichotomized according to recanalization information. Mean quantitative T-2-values were derived for each patient within each region of interest. Mean T-2-values for patients with recanalization (n = 15) in surviving tissue region of interest were 115.8 +/- 7.2 ms (mean +/- SD) and in the lesion growth region of interest 114.6 +/- 7.0 ms. T-2-values for patients without recanalization (n = 7) were 117.7 +/- 11.4 ms in surviving tissue region of interest and 117.3 +/- 12.1 ms in lesion growth region of interest. There was no significant difference between T-2-values measured in lesion growth and surviving tissue region of interest for patients with or without recanalization. Even though it has been shown that T-2-values increase with time from symptom onset within the infarct core, increased T-2-values in areas of perfusion impairment do not identify irreversible damaged brain tissue and high T-2-values are even found in tissue that is not part of the final infarct lesion and can therefore normalize. In conclusion, this study suggests that T-2-values are not a valid imaging biomarker in acute stroke to predict tissue outcome.

N2  -  Conventional structural imaging provides limited information on tumor characterization and prognosis. Advances in neurosurgical techniques, radiotherapy planning and novel drug treatments for brain tumors have generated increasing need for reproducible, noninvasive, quantitative imaging biomarkers. This review considers the role of physiological MRI and PET molecular imaging in understanding metabolic processes associated with tumor growth, blood flow and ultrastructure. we address the utility of various techniques in distinguishing between tumors and non-neoplastic processes, in tumor grading, in defining anatomical relationships between tumor and eloquent brain regions and in determining the biological substrates of treatment response. Much of the evidence is derived from limited case series in individual centers. Despite their 'added value', the effect of these techniques as an adjunct to structural imaging in clinical research and practice remains limited.

N2  -  The combination of mapping functional cortical neurons by intra-operative cortical stimulation and axonal architecture by diffusion tensor MRI fiber tracking can be used to delineate the pathways between functional regions. In this study the authors investigated the feasibility of combining these techniques to yield connectivity associated with motor speech and naming. Diffusion tensor MRI fiber tracking provides maps of axonal bundles and was combined with intraoperative mapping of eloquent cortex for a patient undergoing brain tumor surgery. Tracks from eight stimulated sites in the inferior frontal cortex including mouth motor, speech arrest, and anomia were generated from the diffusion tensor MRI data. The regions connected by the fiber tracking were compared to foci from previous functional imaging reports on language tasks. Connections were found between speech arrest, mouth motor, and anomia sites and the SMA proper and cerebral peduncle. The speech arrest and a mouth motor site were also seen to connect to the putamen via the external capsule. This is the first demonstration of delineation of subcortical pathways using diffusion tensor MRI fiber tracking with intraoperative cortical stimulation. The combined techniques may provide improved preservation of eloquent regions during neurological surgery, and may provide access to direct connectivity information between functional regions of the brain.

N2  -  We recently generated a high-resolution supratentorial vascular topographic atlas using diffusion-weighed MRI in a population of large artery infarcts. These MRI-based topographic maps are not easily applicable to CT scans, because the standard-reference-lines for axial image orientation (i.e., anterior-posterior commissure line versus orbito-meatal line, respectively) are 'not parallel' to each other. Moreover, current, widely-used CT-based vascular topographic diagrams omit demarcation of the inter-territorial border-zones. Thus, we aimed to generate a CT-specific high-resolution atlas, showing the supratentorial cerebrovascular territories and the inter-territorial border-zones in a statistically rigorous way. The diffusion-weighted MRI lesion atlas is based on 1160 patients (67.0 +/- 13.3 years old, 53.7% men) with acute (<1-week) cerebral infarction due to significant (>50%) stenosis or occlusion of a single large cerebral artery: anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery. We developed a software package enabling the transformation of our MR-based atlas into a re-oriented CT space corresponding to the axial slice orientations used in clinical practice. Infarct volumes are individually mapped to the three vascular territories on the CT template-set, generating brain maps showing the voxelwise frequency of infarct by the affected parent vessel. We then mapped the three vascular territories collectively, generating a dataset of Certainty-Index (CI) maps to reflect the likelihood of a voxel being a member of a specific vascular territory. Border-zones could be defined by using either relative infarct frequencies or CI differences. The topographic vascular territory atlas, revised for CT, will allow for easier and more accurate delineation of arterial territories and borders on CT images.

N2  -  Brain metastasis is a common characteristic of late-stage lung cancers. High doses of targeted radiotherapy can control tumor growth in the brain but can also result in radiotherapy-induced necrosis. Current methods are limited for distinguishing whether new parenchymal lesions following radiotherapy are recurrent tumors or radiotherapy-induced necrosis, but the clinical man-agement of these two classes of lesions differs significantly. Here, we developed, validated, and evaluated a new MRI technique termed selective size imaging using filters via diffusion times (SSIFT) to differentiate brain tumors from radiotherapy necrosis in the brain. This approach generates a signal filter that leverages diffusion time dependence to establish a cell size-weighted map. Computer simulations in silico, cultured cancer cells in vitro, and animals with brain tumors in vivo were used to comprehen-sively validate the specificity of SSIFT for detecting typical large cancer cells and the ability to differentiate brain tumors from radiotherapy necrosis. SSIFT was also implemented in patients with metastatic brain cancer and radiotherapy necrosis. SSIFT showed high correlation with mean cell sizes in the relevant range of less than 20 wm. The specificity of SSIFT for brain tumors and reduced contrast in other brain etiologies allowed SSIFT to differentiate brain tumors from peritumoral edema and radio-therapy necrosis. In conclusion, this new, cell size-based MRI method provides a unique contrast to differentiate brain tumors from other pathologies in the brain.Significance: This work introduces and provides preclinical validation of a new diffusion MRI method that exploits intrinsic differences in cell sizes to distinguish brain tumors and radiotherapy necrosis.

N2  -  This paper illustrates the feasibility and utility of combining cranial anatomy and brain function on the same 3D-printed model, as evidenced by a neurosurgical planning case study of a 29-year-old female patient with a low-grade frontal-lobe glioma. We herein report the rapid prototyping methodology utilized in conjunction with surgical navigation to prepare and plan a complex neurosurgery. The method introduced here combines CT and MRI images with DTI tractography, while using various image segmentation protocols to 3D model the skull base, tumor, and five eloquent fiber tracts. This 3D model is rapid-prototyped and coregistered with patient images and a reported surgical navigation system, establishing a clear link between the printed model and surgical navigation. This methodology highlights the potential for advanced neurosurgical preparation, which can begin before the patient enters the operation theatre. Moreover, the work presented here demonstrates the workflow developed at the National University Hospital of Iceland, Landspitali, focusing on the processes of anatomy segmentation, fiber tract extrapolation, MRI/CT registration, and 3D printing. Furthermore, we present a qualitative and quantitative assessment for fiber tract generation in a case study where these processes are applied in the preparation of brain tumor resection surgery.

N2  -  Background and objectives: In Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS), visual hallucinations (VH) are experienced by people with sight loss due to eye disease or lesional damage to early visual pathways. The aim of this crosssectional study was to investigate structural brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in CBS.Methods: Sixteen CBS patients, 17 with eye disease but no VH, and 19 normally sighted people took part. Participants were imaged on a 3T scanner, with 1 mm resolution T1 weighted structural imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging with 64 diffusion directions.Results: The three groups were well matched for age, sex and cognitive scores (MMSE). The two eye disease groups were matched on visual acuity. Compared to the sighted controls, we found reduced grey matter in the occipital cortex in both eye disease groups. We also found reductions of fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivity in widespread areas, including occipital tracts, the corpus callosum, and the anterior thalamic radiation. We did not find any significant differences between the eye disease participants with VH versus without VH, but did observe a negative association between hippocampal volume and VH severity in the CBS group.Discussion: Our findings suggest that although there are cortical and subcortical effects associated with sight loss, structural changes do not explain the occurrence of VHs. CBS may relate instead to connectivity or excitability changes in brain networks linked to vision.

N2  -  Background and purpose Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare complex neurodegenerative disorder presents with various radiological features. The study aimed to investigate the structural abnormalities in NIID using multi-shell diffusion MR. Materials and methods Twenty-eight patients with adult-onset NIID and 32 healthy controls were included. Volumetric and diffusion MRI measures, including volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) of six brain structures, including cortex, subcortical GM, cerebral WM, cerebellar GM and WM, and brainstem, were obtained and compared between NIID and healthy controls. Associations between MRI measures and clinical variables were investigated. Results Brain lesions of NIID included corticomedullary junction lesions on DWI, confluent leukoencephalopathy, lesions on callosum, cerebellar middle peduncle, cerebellar paravermal area and brainstem, and brain atrophy. Compared to healthy controls, NIID showed extensive volume loss of all the six brain regions (all p < 0.001); lower FA in cerebral WM (p < 0.001); higher MD in all WM regions; lower ODI in cortex (p < 0.001); higher ODI in subcortical GM (p < 0.001) and brainstem (p = 0.016); lower ICVF in brainstem (p = 0.001), and cerebral WM (p < 0.001); higher ISOVF in all the brain regions (p < 0.001). Higher MD of cerebellar WM was associated with worse cognitive level as evaluated by MoCA scores (p = 0.011). Conclusions NIID patients demonstrated widespread brain atrophy but heterogeneous diffusion alterations. Cerebellar WM integrity impairment was correlated with the cognitive decline. The findings of the current study offer a sophisticated picture of brain structural alterations in NIID.

N2  -  In this multicenter study, we performed a tractography-based parcellation of the thalamus and its white matter connections to investigate the relationship between thalamic connectivity abnormalities and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). Dual-echo, morphological and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were collected from 52 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 57 healthy controls from six European centers. Patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment. Thalamic connectivity defined regions (CDRs) were segmented based on their cortical connectivity using diffusion tractography-based parcellation. Between-group differences of CDRs and cortico-thalamic tracts DT MRI indices were assessed. A vertex analysis of thalamic shape was also performed. A random forest analysis was run to identify the best imaging predictor of global cognitive impairment and deficits of specific cognitive domains. Twenty-two (43%) MS patients were cognitively impaired (CI). Compared to cognitively preserved, CI MS patients had increased fractional anisotropy of frontal, motor, postcentral and occipital connected CDRs (0.002<P<0.02). They also experienced more pronounced atrophy in anterior thalamic regions and abnormal DT MRI indices of all cortico-thalamic tracts. Damage of specific cortico-thalamic tracts explained global cognitive dysfunction and impairment of selected cognitive domains better than all other MRI variables. Thalamic CDR DT MRI abnormalities were correlated with abnormalities of the corresponding cortico-thalamic tracts. Cortico-thalamic disconnection is, at various levels, implicated in cognitive dysfunction in MS.

N2  -  Objective Accurate identification of potentially salvageable tissues is critical for improving acute stroke treatment. A previous study showed that the kurtosis lesion exhibited insignificant response after prompt reperfusion treatment, while the diffusion/kurtosis lesion mismatch could recover after reperfusion. We hypothesized that these 2 regions are in different metabolic states. Materials and Methods Transient oxygen challenge (OC) is a procedure that uses oxygen as a metabolic bio-tracer and has been performed to explore metabolic activity in tissues. We combined OC with multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion kurtosis imaging and T2* mapping sequences) to study metabolic activity in the ischemic brain of Sprague Dawley rats. Results Oxygen challenge image analysis revealed changes in T2* values, most significantly in the mean diffusivity (MD)/mean kurtosis (MK) lesion mismatch (22.3 +/- 1.6%) and least significantly in the MK lesions (6.6 +/- 0.6%). The MD images acquired within 138 +/- 9 minutes after ischemia showed a larger ischemic lesion (45.5 +/- 3.0% of the total area) than the MK images (33.2 +/- 4.2% of the total area). The change rate of the MK value (53.0 +/- 4.4%) was higher than that of the MD value (37.5 +/- 3.2%). Conclusions The present study shows that MK lesion and MD/MK lesion mismatch exhibited different metabolic activity states. The MK lesion presented metabolic-related values close to the ischemic core, while at least part of the MD/MK mismatch area was comparable with ischemic penumbra metabolic activity. These findings are important to support image-guided individualized stroke therapies.

N2  -  The goal of glioma surgery is maximal safe resection in order to provide optimal tumor control and survival benefit to the patient. There are multiple imaging modalities beyond traditional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that have been incorporated into the preoperative workup of patients presenting with gliomas. The aim of these imaging modalities is to identify cortical and subcortical areas of eloquence, and their relationship to the lesion. In this article, multiple modalities are described with an emphasis on the underlying technology, clinical utilization, advantages, and disadvantages of each. functional MRI and its role in identifying hemispheric dominance and areas of language and motor are discussed. The nuances of magnetoencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation in localization of eloquent cortex are examined, as well as the role of diffusion tensor imaging in defining normal white matter tracts in glioma surgery. Lastly, we highlight the role of stimulated Raman spectroscopy in intraoperative histopathological diagnosis of tissue to guide tumor resection. Tumors may shift the normal arrangement of functional anatomy in the brain; thus, utilization of multiple modalities may be helpful in operative planning and patient counseling for successful surgery.

N2  -  PurposeHyperpolarized C-13 magnetic resonance allows for the study of real-time metabolism in vivo, including significant hyperpolarized C-13 lactate production in many tumors. Other studies have shown that aggressive and highly metastatic tumors rapidly transport lactate out of cells. Thus, the ability to not only measure the production of hyperpolarized C-13 lactate but also understand its compartmentalization using diffusion-weighted MR will provide unique information for improved tumor characterization.
MethodsWe used a bipolar, pulsed-gradient, double spin echo imaging sequence to rapidly generate diffusion-weighted images of hyperpolarized C-13 metabolites. Our methodology included a simultaneously acquired B-1 map to improve apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) accuracy and a diffusion-compensated variable flip angle scheme to improve ADC precision.; ResultsWe validated this sequence and methodology in hyperpolarized C-13 phantoms. Next, we generated ADC maps of several hyperpolarized C-13 metabolites in a normal rat, rat brain tumor, and prostate cancer mouse model using both preclinical and clinical trial-ready hardware.; ConclusionADC maps of hyperpolarized C-13 metabolites provide information about the localization of these molecules in the tissue microenvironment. The methodology presented here allows for further studies to investigate ADC changes due to disease state that may provide unique information about cancer aggressiveness and metastatic potential.

N2  -  Purpose: Advanced imaging modalities such as high b-value diffusion and dynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging have the potential to improve the clinical management of glioblastoma by informing prognosis, predicting sites of progression, and guiding dose-escalated radiation to maximize tumor control and minimize toxicity.
Methods and Materials: Fifty-two patients with de novo glioblastoma underwent magnetic resonance imaging before chemoradiation therapy. Enhanced tumor volumes (TVs), excluding the surgical cavity, hypercellularity (TVHCV) and increased cerebral blood volume (TVCBV) were defined using conventional gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, high b-value (3000 smm(2)) diffusion-weighted images, and cerebral blood volume maps from T1-weighted dynamic contrast enhancement images, respectively. The image-phenotype TVs were analyzed for prediction of progression-free survival (Cox proportional hazard models), and sites of progression (pattern of failure tumor volume).; Results: The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the cohort was 13 months. The TVCBV and TVHCV were spatially distinct, with a mean overlap of only 21%. Univariate analysis showed that increasing age, decreasing radiation dose, larger TVHCV, and larger overlap ofTVHCVand TVCBV were significantly associated with inferior PFS. Multivariate analysis identified that TVHCV was the most adversely prognostic imaging-defined variable. Enhanced TVs, excluding the surgical cavity, and the union of TVHCV and TVCBV showed a high likelihood of containing the pattern of failure tumor volume, and the volume composed of the intersection of TVHCV and TVCBV had an especially high likelihood of progression.; Conclusions: TVHCV and the overlap of TV(HCV)and TVCBV are prognostic for PFS. Combinations of gadolinium- enhanced TVs, TVCBV, andTV(HCV) could predict tumor progression locations better than could individual subvolumes. Radiation dose escalation to these subvolumes could be a promising therapeutic strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose:To determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be used to distinguish between tumor tissue and peritumoral brain tissue in cerebral gliomas.
Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients with 44 biopsies were enrolled in this study. ADC maps calculated from a diffusion-weighted (DW) multislice EPI sequence were coregistered With conventional MR images. Neuronavigated biopsies and intraoperative markers were used for correlation with the histologic specimens.,ADC values and lesion-to-brain ratios of the different sequences were calculated and compared for tumor tissue and peritumoral brain tissue. A logistic regression analysis Was performed to determine the diagnostic value of the ADC maps.; Results: The ADC values and ratios demonstrated a large overlap between tumor tissue and peritumoral tissue. Group comparisons revealed a significantly (P = 0.03) lower ADC ratio in tumor tissue (mean = 1.28 +- 0.39) compared to peritumoral tissue (mean = 1.48 +- 0.30), whereas the absolute ADC values did not differ significantly. In the logistic regression analysis, the lesion-to-brain ratio of the gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-weighted sequence was the most valuable predictor of the presence of tumor tissue. The ADC value and ratio were not identified as significant predictors.; Conclusion: The ADC is not helpful for distinguishing, tumor tissue from peritumoral brain tissue in gliomas.

N2  -  The principal barrier to clinical application of diffusion-weighted MR imaging is the severe image degradation caused by patient motion, One way to compensate for motion effects is the use of a ''navigator echo'' phase correction scheme, In this work, a modification of this technique is introduced, in which the phase correction step is performed in the frequency domain (i.e., after the readout Fourier transform). This significantly improves the robustness of the navigator echo approach and, when combined with cardiac gating, allows diagnostic quality diffusion-weighted images of the brain to be routinely obtained on standard clinical scanner hardware, The technique was evaluated in phantom studies and in 23 humans (3 normal volunteers and 20 patients). Diffusion anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were generated from the image data and showed decreased apparent diffusion in acute stroke lesions and, in several cases, increased apparent diffusion in chronic stroke lesions.

N2  -  Background. - The aim of our study was to report the usefulness of intraoperative MRI guidance in the resection of brain lesions adjacent to eloquent areas.
Patients and methods. - A single center prospective series of gliomas amenable to optimized resection with intraoperative MRI between September 2014 and December 2015.; Results. - The study included 56 patients. The median duration of the first intraoperative MRI was 38 min, interquartile range (IQR 30-46). Fourteen patients (40%) underwent a second intraoperative MRI, which had a median duration of 26 min (IQR, 18-30). The median total operative time was 265 min (IQR, 242-337). After the first intraoperative MRI, the median residual glioma volume of the 35 gliomas adjacent to eloquent areas was 7.04 cm(3) (IQR, 2.22-13.8), which did not significantly differ from the other gliomas (P=0.07). After the second intraoperative MRI, the median residual glioma volume was 3.86 cm(3) (IQR, 0.82-6.99), which did not significantly differ from the other patients (P=0.700). On the postoperative MRI, the median extent of the glioma resections adjacent to eloquent areas was 99.78% (IQR, 88.9-100), which was not significantly different from the rest of the population (P=0.290). At 6 months after surgery, the median Karnofsky Performance Score was 90, and 2.8% of the patients presented a permanent new neurological deficit.; Conclusion. - Our results suggest that intraoperative MRI is an effective and safe technique to improve the extent of brain lesion resections close to eloquent areas.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To integrate spatial three-dimensional information concerning the pyramidal tracts into a customized system for frameless neuronavigation during brain tumor surgery.
METHODS: Four consecutive patients with intracranial tumors in eloquent areas underwent diffusion-weighted and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging studies within 48 hours before surgery. Diffusion-weighted datasets were merged with anatomic data for navigation purposes. The pyramidal tracts were segmented and reconstructed for three-dimensional visualization. The reconstruction results, together with the fused-image dataset, were available during surgery in the environment of a customized neuronavigation system.; RESULTS: In all four patients, the combination of reconstructed data and fused images was a helpful additional source of information concerning the tumor seat and topographical interaction with the pyramidal tract. In two patients, intraoperative motor cortex stimulation verified the tumor seat with regard to the precentral gyrus.; CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows individual estimation of large fiber tracts applicable as important information in intraoperative neuronavigation and in planning brain tumor resection. A three-dimensional representation of fibers associated with the pyramidal tract during brain tumor surgery is feasible with the presented technique and is a helpful adjunct for the neurosurgeon. The main drawbacks include the length of time required for the segmentation procedure, the lack of direct intraoperative control of the pyramidal tract position, and brain shift. However, mapping of large fiber tracts and its intraoperative use for neuronavigation have the potential to increase the safety of neurosurgical procedures and to reduce surgical morbidity.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEThis study assesses whether magnetization transfer (MT) imaging provides additive information to conventional MRI in brain tumors.
METHODSMT data of 26 patients with neoplastic and metastatic brain tumors were analyzed at 1.5 T. For the 3 largest tumor groups investigated in this studyglioblastoma multiforme (GBM), meningiomas, and metastasesstatistical comparisons were performed. Analyzed MT parameters included the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and 4 quantitative MT parameters (qMT): Relaxation times (T1, T2), exchange rate (kf), and macromolecular content (F). Total imaging time of high-resolution whole brain MTR and qMT imaging with balanced steady-state free precession required 9 minutes. Five ROIs were chosen: Contrast-enhancing (T1W-CE), noncontrast-enhancing (T1W-non-CE), proximal hyperintensity (T2W-pSI), distal hyperintensity (T2W-dSI), and a reference (ref).; RESULTSPathologies showed significant (P < .05) MT changes (MTR and qMT) compared to the reference. The T1W-CE, T1W-non-CE, and T2W-pSI ROIs of GBMs, meningiomas, and metastases showed significant differences in MTR and qMT estimates. Similar MTR with significant different qMT values were observed in several ROIs among different lesions. MT maps (MTR and qMT) indicated changes in tissue appearing unaffected on MRI in most glial tumors.; CONCLUSIONSMTR and qMT imaging enables a better differentiation between brain tumors and provides additive information to MRI.

N2  -  BackgroundPurpose/HypothesisThe major factor for the appropriate treatment strategies for ischemia patients is its onset timing.
To study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of T-1 relaxation time in a rotating frame (T-1) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from MRI to estimate ischemia stages.; Study TypePopulationSubjectsPhantomSpecimenAnimal ModelProspective.; In all, 73 patients (49 males, aged 29-78 years and 24 females, aged 22-94 years) with ischemia were prospectively imaged with T-1 and diffusion MRI during the postischemic period.; Field StrengthSequenceAssessment3TT-1 and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).; Ischemic parenchyma included tissue with elevated signal areas on DWI and correlative hypointense areas on ADC maps.; Statistical TestsResultsThe sensitivity of variables to ischemia time was quantified by analyzing the respective correlations of these values with onset time.; T-1 (ipsilateral-contralateral differences in T-1) (R-2=0.956) and T-1ipsi (ipsilateral ischemia T-1 values) (R-2=0.941) were elevated in all ischemic lesions; these values increased linearly as a function of time, unlike ADC (ipsilateral-contralateral differences in ADC) (R-2=-0.410) and ADC(ipsi) (ipsilateral ischemia ADC values) (R-2=0.550). T-1 and T-1ipsi were significantly different between all stages (P<0.01), except the acute and hyperacute stages (P=0.589 for T-1, P=0.290 for T-1ipsi, respectively), but ADC and ADC(ipsi) only between the late subacute and early subacute stages (P<0.01) and the late subacute and chronic stages (P<0.01).; Data ConclusionThese data suggest that T-1 can provide estimates for the ischemic time in patients. T-1 has the potential to outperform diffusion for single-timepoint examination because the T-1 change during strokes is positive and linear. If patients with suspected stroke are scanned by MRI within the appropriate timeframe, T-1 may provide tools for evaluating stroke onset, potentially aiding in treatment strategies.

N2  -  BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) cellularity correlates with whole brain spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) generated relative choline to N-Acetyl-Aspartate ratio (rChoNAA) mapping. In recurrent GBM (rGBM), tumor volume (TV) delineation is challenging and rChoNAA maps may assist with re-RT targeting.MethodsFourteen rGBM patients underwent sMRI in a prospective study. Whole brain sMRI was performed to generate rChoNAA maps. TVs were delineated by the union of rChoNAA ratio over 2 (rChoNAA > 2) on sMRI and T1PC. rChoNAA > 2 volumes were compared with multiparametric MRI sequences including T1PC, T2/FLAIR, diffusion-restriction on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and perfusion relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV).ResultsrChoNAA > 2 (mean 27.6 cc, range 6.6-79.1 cc) was different from other imaging modalities (P <= 0.05). Mean T1PC volumes were 10.7 cc (range 1.2-31.4 cc). The mean non-overlapping volume of rChoNAA > 2 and T1PC was 29.2 cm(3). rChoNAA > 2 was 287% larger (range 23% smaller-873% larger) than T1PC. T2/FLAIR volumes (mean 111.7 cc, range 19.0-232.7 cc) were much larger than other modalities. rCBV volumes (mean 6.2 cc, range 0.2-19.1 cc) and ADC volumes were tiny (mean 0.8 cc, range 0-3.7 cc). Eight in-field failures were observed. Three patients failed outside T1PC but within rChoNAA > 2. No grade 3 toxicities attributable to re-RT were observed. Median progression-free and overall survival for re-RT patients were 6.5 and 7.1 months, respectively.ConclusionsTreatment of rGBM may be optimized by sMRI, and failure patterns suggest benefit for dose-escalation within sMRI-delineated volumes. Dose-escalation and radiologic-pathologic studies are underway to confirm the utility of sMRI in rGBM.

N2  -  Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor with a propensity for intracranial recurrence. We hypothesized that tumors can be visualized with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before they are detected on anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images. We retrospectively analyzed serial MR images from 30 patients, including the DTI and T1-weighted images at recurrence, at 2 months and 4 months before recurrence, and at 1 month after radiation therapy. The diffusion maps and T1 images were deformably registered longitudinally. The recurrent tumor was manually segmented on the T1-weighted image and then applied to the diffusion maps at each time point to collect mean FA, diffusivities, and neurite density index (NDI) values, respectively. Group analysis of variance showed significant changes in FA (p = 0.01) and NDI (p = 0.0015) over time. Pairwise t tests also revealed that FA and NDI at 2 months before recurrence were 11.2% and 6.4% lower than those at 1 month after radiation therapy (p < 0.05), respectively. Changes in FA and NDI were observed 2 months before recurrence, suggesting that progressive microstructural changes and neurite density loss may be detectable before tumor detection in anatomical MR images. FA and NDI may serve as non-contrast MR-based biomarkers for detecting subclinical tumors.

N2  -  Brain myelin and iron content are important parameters in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Both myelin and iron content influence the brain's R-2* relaxation rate. However, their quantification based on R-2* maps requires a realistic tissue model that can be fitted to the measured data. In structures with low myelin content, such as deep gray matter, R-2* shows a linear increase with increasing iron content. In white matter, R-2* is not only affected by iron and myelin but also by the orientation of the myelinated axons with respect to the external magnetic field. Here, we propose a numerical model which incorporates iron and myelin, as well as fibre orientation, to simulate R-2* decay in white matter. Applying our model to fibre orientation-dependent in vivo R-2* data, we are able to determine a unique solution of myelin and iron content in global white matter. We determine an averaged myelin volume fraction of 16.02 +/- 2.07% in non-lesional white matter of patients with MS, 17.32 +/- 2.20% in matched healthy controls, and 18.19 +/- 2.98% in healthy siblings of patients with MS. Averaged iron content was 35.6 +/- 8.9 mg/kg tissue in patients, 43.1 +/- 8.3 mg/kg in controls, and 47.8 +/- 8.2 mg/kg in siblings. All differences in iron content between groups were significant, while the difference in myelin content between MS patients and the siblings of MS patients was significant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a model that combines myelin-induced orientation-dependent and iron-induced orientation-independent components is able to fit in vivo R-2* data.

N2  -  To investigate the increase in MRI contrast enhancement (CE) occurring in glioblastoma during the period between surgery and initiation of chemo-radiotherapy, thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were analyzed by early post-operative magnetic resonance (EPMR) imaging within three days of surgery and by pre-adjuvant magnetic resonance (PAMR) examination before adjuvant therapy. Areas of new CE were investigated by use of EPMR diffusion-weighted imaging and PAMR perfusion imaging (by arterial spin-labeling). PAMR was acquired, on average, 29.9 days later than EPMR (range 20-37 days). During this period an increased area of CE was observed for 17/37 patients. For 3/17 patients these regions were confined to areas of reduced EPMR diffusion, suggesting postsurgical infarct. For the other 14/17 patients, these areas suggested progression. For 11/17 patients the co-occurrence of hyperperfusion in PAMR perfusion suggested progression. PAMR perfusion and EPMR diffusion did not give consistent results for 3/17 patients for whom small new areas of CE were observed, presumably because of the poor spatial resolution of perfusion imaging. Before initiation of adjuvant therapy, areas of new CE of resected glioblastomas are frequently observed. Most of these suggest tumor progression, according to EPMR diffusion and PAMR perfusion criteria.

N2  -  AIM: To investigate the prognostic power of intra-tumoural and gradient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion metrics in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients with histologically confirmed GBM who had undergone preoperative diffusion tensor imaging at 3 T were included. Mean diffusivity (MD) and MD gradient maps were computed. Regions of interest were analysed to determine the minimum MD within the enhancing tumour (minMD). MD gradients were calculated along the enhancing tumour boundary and subjected to histogram analysis. Overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were derived and survival analysis was undertaken.; RESULTS: There were 31 deaths and 37 patients progressed during the study period. Multivariate survival analysis, controlling for treatment and gender, showed that minMD values<6.1 x 10(-4) mm(2)s predicted shorter OS (hazard ratio HR=2.82, 1.25-6.34; p=0.012) and TTP (HR=5.43, 1.96-15.05; p=0.001). Higher MD gradient values of the tumour boundary predicted shorter survival: MD gradient values >4.7x10(-5) mm(2)s (10th centile) had a significantly shorter OS with a HR of 0.43 (0.19-0.96; p=0.04). Similarly, a value above 1.4x10(-4) mm(2)s (75th centile) was a significant predictor for shorter OS (HR=0.39, 0.17-0.89; p=0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: Lower minMD and higher MD gradient values for the 10th and 75th percentile of the tumour boundary demonstrated prognostic value in preoperative GBM. This suggests that MRI diffusion metrics indicative of higher focal cellularity and steeper transition from high cellular tumour edge to low cellular oedema define more aggressive glioblastoma subtypes with a poorer prognosis.

N2  -  This review recounts the history of brain tumor diagnosis from antiquity to the present and, indirectly, the history of neuroradiology. Imaging of the brain has from the beginning held an enormous interest because of the inherent difficulty of this endeavor due to the presence of the skull. Because of this, most techniques when newly developed have always been used in neuroradiology and, although some have proved to be inappropriate for this purpose, many were easily incorporated into the specialty. The first major advance in modern neuroimaging was contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography, which permitted accurate anatomic localization of brain tumors and, by virtue of contrast enhancement, malignant ones. The most important advances in neuroimaging occurred with the development of magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted sequences that allowed an indirect estimation of tumor cellularity; this was further refined by the development of perfusion and permeability mapping. From its beginnings with indirect and purely anatomic imaging techniques, neuroradiology now uses a combination of anatomic and physiologic techniques that will play a critical role in biologic tumor imaging and radiologic genomics.

N2  -  Intraoperative high-field MRI with integrated microscope-based neuronavigation is a safe and reliable technique providing immediate intraoperative quality control. Major indications are pituitary tumor, glioma, and epilepsy surgery. Intraoperative high-field MRI provides intraoperative anatomic images at high quality that are up to the standard of pre- and postoperative neuroradiologic imaging. Compared with previous low-field MRI systems used for intraoperative imaging, not only is the image quality is clearly superior but the imaging spectrum is much wider and the intraoperative work flow is improved. Furthermore, high-field MRI offers various modalities beyond standard anatomic imaging, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to distinguish anti-vascular and anti-tumor effects in the course of anti-angiogenic treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG) as compared to standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
This retrospective study analyzed ADC maps from diffusion-weighted MRI in 14 rHGG patients during bevacizumabirinotecan (BI) therapy. Applying image segmentation, volumes of contrast-enhanced lesions in T1 sequences and of hyperintense T2 lesions (hT2) were calculated. hT2 were defined as regions of interest (ROI) and registered to corresponding ADC maps (hT2-ADC). Histograms were calculated from hT2-ADC ROIs. Thereafter, histogram asymmetry termed "skewness" was calculated and compared to progression-free survival (PFS) as defined by the Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group criteria.; At 8-12 weeks follow-up, seven (50%) patients showed a partial response, three (21.4%) patients were stable, and four (28.6%) patients progressed according to RANO criteria. hT2-ADC histograms demonstrated statistically significant changes in skewness in relation to PFS at 6 months. Patients with increasing skewness (n = 11) following BI therapy had significantly shorter PFS than did patients with decreasing or stable skewness values (n = 3, median percentage change in skewness 54% versus -3%, p = 0.04).; In rHGG patients, the change in ADC histogram skewness may be predictive for treatment response early in the course of anti-angiogenic therapy and more sensitive than treatment assessment based solely on RANO criteria.

Routine precontrast and postcontrast MR imaging helps in localization, characterization, delineation of extension, and follow-up of the parasitic lesions. Moreover, recently developed tools, such as diffusion, perfusion, and MR spectroscopy, help to differentiate parasitic diseases of the central nervous system from simulating lesions. Combining imaging findings with geographic prevalence, clinical history, and serologic tests is required for diagnosis of parasitic diseases of the central nervous system.

T2  -  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

N2  -  Following a previous study with diffusion tensor imaging, we investigated the correlation between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS). We studied 60 MS patients (mean age 45.8 +/- 9.0 years) using 1.5-T MRI. Disease course was RR = 40 and SP = 20. Mean disease duration was 12.8 +/- 8.7 years. Mean EDSS was 3.4 +/- 1.7. Whole brain, gray and white matter normalized volumes were calculated on 3D SPGR T1-WI using a fully automated Hybrid SIENAX method. Parenchymal mean diffusivity (PMD) maps were created after automated segmentation of the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid using T2-WI and DW images. Histogram analysis was performed and DWI indices of peak position (PP), peak height (PH), mean parenchymal diffusivity (MPD) and entropy were obtained. Neuropsychological (NP) evaluation emphasized auditory/verbal and visual/spatial memory, as well as processing speed and executive function. We found significant correlations between DWI and performance in all cognitive domains. Overall, stronger correlations emerged for MPD and entropy than other DWI measures, although all correlations were in the expected direction. The strongest association was between DWI entropy and performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which assesses processing speed and working memory (r = -0.54). Fisher r to z transformations revealed that DWI, gray matter (GMF) and whole brain (BPF) atrophy, T1-lesion volume (LV) and T2-LV all accounted for similar amounts of variance in NP testing. Stepwise regression models determined whether multiple MRI measures predicted unique additive variance in test performance. GMF (R-2 = 0.35, F 30.82, P < 0.01) and entropy (Delta R-2 = 0.06, Delta F= 5.47, P < 0.05) both accounted for unique variance in processing speed. Our data make a stronger case for the clinical validity of DWI in MS than heretofore reported. DWI has very short acquisition times, and the segmentation method applied in the present study is reliable and fully automated. Given its overall simplicity and moderate correlation with cognition, DWI may offer several logistic advantages over more traditional MRI measures when predicting the presence of NP impairment.

N2  -  Diffusion-relaxation correlation NMR can simultaneously characterize both the microstructure and the local chemical composition of complex samples that contain multiple populations of water. Recent developments on tensor-valued diffusion encoding and Monte Carlo inversion algorithms have made it possible to transfer diffusion-relaxation correlation NMR from small-bore scanners to clinical MRI systems. Initial studies on clinical MRI systems employed 5D D-R-1 and D-R-2 correlation to characterize healthy brain in vivo. However, these meth-ods are subject to an inherent bias that originates from not including R-2 or R-1 in the analysis, respectively. This drawback can be remedied by extending the concept to 6D D-R-1-R-2 correlation. In this work, we present a sparse acquisition protocol that records all data necessary for in vivo 6D D-R-1-R-2 correlation MRI across 633 individual measurements within 25 min -a time frame comparable to previous lower-dimensional acquisition protocols. The data were processed with a Monte Carlo inversion algorithm to obtain nonparametric 6D D-R-1-R-2 distri-butions. We validated the reproducibility of the method in repeated measurements of healthy volunteers. For a post-therapy glioblastoma case featuring cysts, edema, and partially necrotic remains of tumor, we present repre-sentative single-voxel 6D distributions, parameter maps, and artificial contrasts over a wide range of diffusion-, R-1-, and R-2-weightings based on the rich information contained in the D-R-1-R-2 distributions.

N2  -  AIM: To evaluate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) as a marker for disease aggressiveness by comparing tumour apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) between patients with low- versus higher-risk localized prostate cancer.
METHOD: Forty-four consecutive patients classified as low- n = 26, stageT1T2a, Gleason score <= 6, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10 (group 1) or intermediatehigh- n = 18, stage >= T2b andor Gleason score >= 7, andor PSA > 10 (group 2) risk, who subsequently were monitored with active surveillance or started neoadjuvant hormone and radiotherapy, respectively, underwent endorectal MRI. T2-weighted (T2W) and DW images (5 b values, 0-800 smm(2)) were acquired and isotropic ADC maps generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) on T2W axial images around whole prostate, central gland (CG), and tumour were transferred to ADC maps. Tumour, CG, and peripheral zone (PZ = whole prostate minus CG and tumour) ADCs (fast component from b = 0-100 smm(2), slow component from b = 100-800 smm(2)) were compared.; RESULTS: T2W-defined tumour volume medians, and quartiles were 1.2 cm(3), 0.7 and 3.3 cm(3) (group 1); and 6 cm(3), 1.3 and 16.5 cm(3) (group 2). There were significant differences in both ADC(fast) (1778 +- 264 x 10(-6) versus 1583 +- 283 x 10(-6) mm(2)s, p = 0.03) and ADC(slow) (1379 +- 321 x 10(-6) versus 1196 +- 158 x 10(-6) mm(2)s, p = 0.001) between groups. Tumour volume (p = 0.002) and ADC(slow) (p = 0.005) were significant differentiators of risk group.; CONCLUSION: Significant differences in tumour ADCs exist between patients with low-risk, and those with higher-risk localized prostate cancer. DW-MRI merits further study with respect to clinical outcomes. (C) 2008 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose We aimed to re-evaluate the relationship between thalamic infarct (TI) localization and clinical symptoms using a vascular (VTM) and a novel functional territorial thalamic map (FTM). Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data of 65 patients with isolated TI were evaluated (female n = 23, male n = 42, right n = 23, left n = 42). A VTM depicted the known seven thalamic vascular territories (VT: inferolateral, anterolateral, inferomedial, posterior, central, anteromedian, posterolateral). An FTM was generated from a probabilistic thalamic nuclei atlas to determine six functionally defined territories (FT: anterior: memory/emotions; ventral: motor/somatosensory/language; medial: behavior/emotions/nociception, oculomotor; intralaminar: arousal/pain; lateral: visuospatial/somatosensory/conceptual and analytic thinking; posterior: audiovisual/somatosensory). Four neuroradiologists independently assigned diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions to the territories mapped by the VTM and FTM. Findings were correlated with clinical features. Results The most frequent symptom was a hemisensory syndrome (58%), which was not specific for any territory. A co-occurrence of hemisensory syndrome and hemiparesis had positive predictive values (PPV) of 76% and 82% for the involvement of the inferolateral VT and ventral FT, respectively. Thalamic aphasia had a PPV of 63% each for involvement of the anterolateral VT and ventral FT. Neglect was associated with involvement of the inferolateral VT/ventral FT. Interrater reliability for the assignment of DWI lesions to the VTM was fair (kappa = 0.36), but good (kappa = 0.73) for the FTM. Conclusion The FTM revealed a greater reproducibility for the topographical assignment of TI than the VTM. Sensorimotor hemiparesis and neglect are predictive for a TI in the inferolateral VT/ventral FT. The hemisensory syndrome alone does not allow any topographical assignment.

N2  -  Imaging of the electrical conductivity distribution inside the human body has been investigated for numerous clinical applications. The conductivity tensors of biological tissue have been obtained from water diffusion tensors by applying several models, which may not cover the entire phenomenon. Recently, a new conductivity tensor imaging (CTI) method was developed through a combination of B1 mapping, and multi-b diffusion weighted imaging. In this study, we compared the most recent CTI method with the four existing models of conductivity tensors reconstruction. Two conductivity phantoms were designed to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Applied to five human brains, the conductivity tensors using the four existing models and CTI were imaged and compared with the values from the literature. The conductivity image of the phantoms by the CTI method showed relative errors between 1.10% and 5.26%. The images by the four models using DTI could not measure the effects of different ion concentrations subsequently due to prior information of the mean conductivity values. The conductivity tensor images obtained from five human brains through the CTI method were comparable to previously reported literature values. The images by the four methods using DTI were highly correlated with the diffusion tensor images, showing a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.65 to 1.00. However, the images by the CTI method were less correlated with the diffusion tensor images and exhibited an averaged R-2 value of 0.51. The CTI method could handle the effects of different ion concentrations as well as mobilities and extracellular volume fractions by collecting and processing additional B1 map data. It is necessary to select an application-specific model taking into account the pros and cons of each model. Future studies are essential to confirm the usefulness of these conductivity tensor imaging methods in clinical applications, such as tumor characterization, EEG source imaging, and treatment planning for electrical stimulation.

N2  -  Aim: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging for differentiation of Brain abscesses from brain lesions taking surgical findings as gold standard.
Methods: This cross sectional study was done at department of Radiology, Lahore General Hospital, Lahore. The study was completed in Six Months (October 1, 2014 till March 31, 2105). After taking informed consent, demographic information (name, age, gender and contact) was obtained. Then patients underwent through Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied with a diffusion sensitivity of b = 0, 500 and 1000smm(2). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were also calculated on computer software. ADC values were taken from the center and wall of the lesion as well as from the surrounding oedema. DWI were analyzed on the basis of signal intensity on diffusion images and corresponding ADC maps. Then patients were underwent biopsyfor histopathology. All biopsysamples were sent to the histopathology laboratoryof hospital and results were compared with results of DWI.; Results: The mean age of the patients was 43.74 +- 14.64 years with minimum and maximum ages of 20 & 70 years respectively. Out of 145(65.91%) patients were male and 75(34.09%) patients were females. The male to female ratio was 1.933:1. The sensitivity of DWI in our study was 91.67%, specificity was 93.18%, positive predictive value was 95.28%, negative predictive value was 88.17% and the diagnostic accuracy was 92.27% taking histopathology as gold standard.; Conclusion: Diffusion weighted imaging is an effective method with high sensitivity and specificity which can help in differentiation of Brain abscesses from brain lesions.

N2  -  Background/Aims: To identify the pyramidal tract by neuronavigation based on intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (iDWI) combined with subcortical stimulation. Methods: Seven patients with brain tumors near the deep white matter underwent resection surgery using neuronavigation based on iDWI to visualize white matter bundles. Subcortical electrical stimulation was performed and electromyography was measured at the extremities when surgical manipulation came near the position corresponding to the depicted bundle. We validated the bundle depicted on iDWI by considering the responses to subcortical stimulation and the distance between the stimulation site and the depicted bundle. Results: Positive motor-evoked potentials were detected in 5 of 7 patients (8 stimulations) and the distance from the stimulation site to the depicted bundle was 0-4.7 mm (mean +/- SD, 1.4 +/- 2.1 mm). Negative (no) responses were obtained in all patients when the distance was more than 5 mm. The neuronavigation system had an average error of 0.79 +/- 0.25 mm and a maximum error of 2.0 mm (n = 16). Conclusion: Neuronavigation based on iDWI combined with subcortical stimulation allowed surgeons to identify the pyramidal tract and avoid inadvertent injury. Our findings demonstrate that the white matter bundles depicted by iDWI can contain the pyramidal tract. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  MR-based diffusion- and perfusion- weighted imaging (DWI/PWI) has become the standard imaging technique to assess the individual brain pathophysiological status in acute ischemic stroke. The finding of a "mismatch" with larger PWI than DWI abnormality is thought to reflect the presence of tissue at-risk of infarction, i.e., penumbra. However, there has been no detailed study of the quantitative relationships between perfusion and diffusion changes in stroke patients. According to the experimental concept of penumbra, the ADC would be expected to remain unchanged despite decreasing perfusion until a critical threshold is reached. We have tested this hypothesis directly in man.
Methods: DWIPWI was performed in 7 patients with MCA territory stroke within 4-10 hrs from onset. Mismatch was defined on diffiision and rMTT maps, and circular ROIs were positioned within the ADC lesion (D), the mismatch area (M), and the normal appearing cortex (N); mirror ROIs were also obtained, and affectedunaffected ratios for ADC and rCBF were computed for each ROI.; Results: The mean (+- ISD) ADC ratios were 0.60 +- 0.09, 0.95 +- 0.10 and 1.02 +- 0.04 in L, M and N, respectively; the corresponding rCBF ratios were 0.32 +- 0.12, 0.75 +- 0.14 and 0.97 +- 0.09, respectively. The relationship was non-linear, with the rCBF but not the ADC ratio for M being significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that for N. A threshold for decline in ADC was apparent around 0.50 rCBF ratio.; Comment: These results directly document in man that the ADC declines only after hypoperfusion has reached a certain degree (about 50%), consistent with the concept of the ischaemic penumbra.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Aging is accompanied by clinically silent cerebral white matter injury identified through white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-and diffusion tensor imaging-based measures of white matter integrity. The temporal course of FLAIR and diffusion tensor imaging changes within WMHs and their less-injured periphery (ie, their penumbra), however, has not been fully studied. We used longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging and FLAIR to explore these changes.
Methods-One hundred fifteen participants, aged 73.7 +- 6.7 years, received clinical evaluations and MRIs on 2 dates. WMHs and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were produced from FLAIR and diffusion tensor imaging and coregistered to a standardized space. Each distinct WMH was categorized as growing, stagnant, or noncontiguous incident. The penumbra of each WMH was similarly categorized as corresponding to a stagnant, growing, or noncontiguous incident WMH. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess whether FA and FLAIR measurements changed between baseline and follow-up and differed between tissue categories.; Results-Baseline FA differed significantly by tissue category, with the following ordering of categories from highest to lowest FA: penumbra of noncontiguous incident, then stagnant, then growing WMHs; noncontiguous incident, then stagnant, then growing WMHs. Despite differences in baseline values, all tissue categories experienced declines in FA over time. Only noncontiguous incident WMHs showed significant FLAIR signal increases over time, and FLAIR signal significantly decreased in stagnant WMHs.; Conclusions-WMHs and their penumbra vary in severity and together span a continuous spectrum of white matter injury that worsens with time. FLAIR fails to capture this continuous injury process fully but does identify a subclass of lesions that seem to improve over time.

N2  -  RATIONALE: Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) remains challenging due in part to its histologic intratumoral heterogeneity that contributes to its overall poor treatment response. Our goal was to evaluate a voxel-based biomarker, the functional diffusion map (fDM), as an imaging biomarker to detect heterogeneity of tumor response in a radiation dose escalation protocol using a genetically engineered murine GBM model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four genetically engineered murine GBM models [Ink4a-Arf(-/-) /Pten(loxp/loxp)/Ntv-a RCAS/PDGF(+)/Cre <+>] were randomized in four treatment groups (n = 6 per group) consisting of daily doses of 0, 1, 2, and 4 Gy delivered for 5 days. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired for tumor delineation and quantification of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, respectively. MRI experiments were performed daily for a week and every 2 days thereafter. For each animal, the area under the curve (AUC) of the percentage change of the ADC (AUC(ADC)) and that of the increase in fDM values (AUC(fDM+)) were determined within the first 5 days following therapy initiation. RESULTS: Animal survival increased with increasing radiation dose. Treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in tumor ADC values. The strongest correlation between survival and ADC measurements was observed using the AUC(fDM+) metric (R-2 = 0.88). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the efficacy of a voxel-based imaging biomarker (fDM) was able to detect spatially varying changes in tumors, which were determined to be a more sensitive predictor of overall response versus whole-volume tumor measurements (AUCADC). Finally, fDM provided for visualization of treatment-associated spatial heterogeneity within the tumor.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and image registration were used to investigate a patient with a massive left-sided brain tumor, whose size was largely disproportionate to his subtle neurological deficits. MRI was obtained from the patient and his healthy identical twin, who acted as anatomical reference for DTI and as a control for quantitative measures. To compensate for the patient's altered anatomy, seed and way points for probabilistic tractography were drawn on the color-coded direction maps of the healthy twin. Registration, based on the combination of b(0)-images, T2-weighted and T1-weighted images, was used to identify the corresponding regions in the patient. The corticospinal tract (CST), the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and the cingulum bundle (CB) showed displaced anatomy. A significant difference was found. between fractional anisotropy distribution along the left SLF and CB, but not along the CST. These findings fit well with the patient's substantial preservation of his motor abilities, while abnormalities of the SLF and CB could explain the subtle but detectable cognitive deficits.

N2  -  Purpose: To assess and compare the potential of various diffusion-related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters to detect early radiotherapy (RT)-induced changes in tumors.
Materials and Methods: Nineteen tumors in a rat model were imaged on a clinical 3T system before and 72 hours after a single RT session. Diffusion imaging was performed using an echo planar sequence containing 16 b-factors and six gradient directions. This allowed us to perform a tensor analysis of mono-and biexponential decays and a q-space analysis. Parametric maps (both trace and fractional anisotropy) were reconstructed for: 2-point apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), 16-point ADC, biexponential amplitudes and ADCs, and height, width, and kurtosis of the probability density function (PDF). A texture analysis yielded quantities such as average and contrast. The sensitivity of diffusion-related parameters was quantified in terms of the mean relative difference (when comparing pre- and post-RT status).; Results: Traces and anisotropies display differences in response to RT. Average traces are most sensitive for ADCs and kurtosis. Average anisotropies are all very sensitive except the slow biexponential component. The best contrast (traces) was found for the ADCs and the width of the PDF.; Conclusion: ADC performed well, but high b-values analysis added extra sensitive parameters for monitoring early RT-induced changes.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Embolic events are a major cause for procedure-related strokes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Transcranial Doppler sonography can reveal embolic events as microembolic signals (MES) during CEA. MES during declamping and shunting are frequently detected. MES during shunting are rare and known to be correlated with the neurological outcome of the patient. In the present study, we analyzed the occurrence of MES within different stages of CEA and whether MES within those stages were correlated with cerebral ischemia, as detected by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and brain infarction, as detected by contrast-enhanced MRI.
Methods-Thirty-three patients were monitored intraoperatively for MES using transcranial Doppler sonography. DWI was performed within 24 hours before and after surgery. Positive postoperative DWI led to reexamination with contrast-enhanced T1-MRI 7 to 10 days after CEA for detection of cerebral infarction.; Results-MES were detected in 32 of 33 patients. The highest number of MES was found during shunting and declamping. A significant correlation was found between MES and DWI-lesions during dissection. A significant correlation was found between MES during dissection and shunting, and nonsignificant correlation was found between MES and the occurrence of cerebral infarction.; Conclusion-MES could be regularly detected during CEA. Dissection and shunting seem to be the most vulnerable stages of the procedure.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate whether neurological symptoms related to a specific axonal fiber tract in brain white matter were associated with a higher degree of tissue damage in that region, in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis. To this end, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to segment and evaluate the fiber bundle of interest was implemented, taking care to circumvent the problems caused by pathology. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography was used to construct, from healthy volunteer data, a probability map for the pyramidal tract (PYT), and this map was applied to patients to calculate DT-derived metrics inside the PYT.
In CIS patients with clinical symptoms related to motor function, the DT-derived mean diffusivity and the lesion volume in the PYT were found to be increased, while the fractional anisotropy was no different, when compared to those patients without motor symptoms. These results may be explained by several microstructural changes in the damaged tissue, such as changes in the permeability of axonal cell membranes, decreases of axonal density and edema.; The approach taken to analyze a specific fiber tract was possible because the axons in the tract have a high orientational coherence, allowing tissue structure changes to be isolated from the tissue architecture. Its extension to other white matter fiber bundles is therefore limited to bundles with high orientational coherence. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) with simultaneous data acquisition promises a comprehensive evaluation of cerebral pathophysiology on a molecular, anatomical, and functional level. Considering the necessary changes to the MR scanner design the feasibility of arterial spin labeling (ASL) is unclear.
Purpose: To evaluate whether cerebral blood flow imaging with ASL is feasible using a prototype PETMRI device.; Material and Methods: ASL imaging of the brain with Flow-sensitive Alternating Inversion Recovery (FAIR) spin preparation and true fast imaging in steady precession (TrueFISP) data readout was performed in eight healthy volunteers sequentially on a prototype PETMRI and a stand-alone MR scanner with 128 x 128 and 192 x 192 matrix sizes. Cerebral blood flow values for gray matter, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, and relative signal change were compared. Additionally, the feasibility of ASL as part of a clinical hybrid PETMRI protocol was demonstrated in five patients with intracerebral tumors.; Results: Blood flow maps showed good delineation of gray and white matter with no discernible artifacts. The mean blood flow values of the eight volunteers on the PETMR system were 51 +- 9 and 51 +- 7 mL100 gmin for the 128 x 128 and 192 x 192 matrices (stand-alone MR, 57 +- 2 and 55 +- 5, not significant). The value for signal-to-noise (SNR) was significantly higher for the PETMRI system using the 192 x 192 matrix size (P < 0.01), the relative signal change (delta S) was significantly lower for the 192 x 192 matrix size (P = 0.02). ASL imaging as part of a clinical hybrid PETMRI protocol could successfully be accomplished in all patients in diagnostic image quality.; Conclusion: ASL brain imaging is feasible with a prototype hybrid PETMRI scanner, thus adding to the value of this novel imaging technique.

N2  -  Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in American football players has garnered increasing public attention following reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive tauopathy. While the mechanisms underlying repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-induced neurodegeneration are unknown and antemortem diagnostic tests are not available, neuropathology studies suggest a pathogenic role for microvascular injury, specifically blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Thus, our main objective was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI approach we have developed to detect impairments in brain microvascular function. To this end, we scanned 42 adult male amateur American football players and a control group comprising 27 athletes practicing a non-contact sport and 26 non-athletes. MRI scans were also performed in 51 patients with brain pathologies involving the blood-brain barrier, namely malignant brain tumours, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic traumatic contusion. Based on data from prolonged scans, we generated maps that visualized the permeability value for each brain voxel. Our permeability maps revealed an increase in slow blood-to-brain transport in a subset of amateur American football players, but not in sex- and age-matched controls. The increase in permeability was region specific (white matter, midbrain peduncles, red nucleus, temporal cortex) and correlated with changes in white matter, which were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging. Additionally, increased permeability persisted for months, as seen in players who were scanned both on- and off-season. Examination of patients with brain pathologies revealed that slow tracer accumulation characterizes areas surrounding the core of injury, which frequently shows fast blood-to-brain transport. Next, we verified our method in two rodent models: rats and mice subjected to repeated mild closed-head impact injury, and rats with vascular injury inflicted by photothrombosis. In both models, slow blood-to-brain transport was observed, which correlated with neuropathological changes. Lastly, computational simulations and direct imaging of the transport of Evans blue-albumin complex in brains of rats subjected to recurrent seizures or focal cerebrovascular injury suggest that increased cellular transport underlies the observed slow blood-to-brain transport. Taken together, our findings suggest dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI can be used to diagnose specific microvascular pathology after traumatic brain injury and other brain pathologies.

N2  -  Glioblastoma multiforme are infiltrative lesions that have a high degree of heterogeneity, both within and between different patients. Imaging is critical for all phases in the evaluation and treatment of these lesions, but has been limited in providing information that is reliable enough to stratify patients into groups with uniform behavior and to predict outcome. Although magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice for visualizing anatomic features of the lesion, its results are ambiguous in terms of defining the functional characteristics of the lesion and distinguishing tumor from treatment induced necrosis. Recent advances in magnetic resonance have made possible the routine acquisition of physiological data such as perfusion-and diffusion-weighted images and of metabolic data such as water suppressed proton spectroscopic images. These provide quantitative measurements that are more closely related to the biological properties of the tumor and reflect changes in tumor vascularity, cellularity and proliferation that are associated with tumor progression. As the molecular properties that influence invasion and neoplastic transformation are elucidated, it is critical that noninvasive imaging techniques are available for investigating new therapies and tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics. The data obtained from patients with glioblastoma multiforme have already demonstrated that these new magnetic resonance techniques are able to contribute to diagnosis, characterization of malignant potential, treatment planning and assessment of response to therapy.

N2  -  Aside from bidimensional measurements from conventional contrast-enhanced MRI, there are no validated or FDA-qualified imaging biomarkers for high-grade gliomas. However, advanced functional MRI techniques, including perfusion-and diffusion-weighted MRI, have demonstrated much potential for determining prognosis, predicting therapeutic response, and assessing early treatment response. They may also prove useful for differentiating pseudoprogression from true progression after temozolomide chemoradiation and pseudoresponse from true response after anti-angiogenic therapy. This review will highlight recent developments using these techniques and emphasize the need for technical standardization and validation in prospective studies in order for these methods to become incorporated into standard-of-care imaging for brain tumor patients.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to explore the evolution of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in normal-appearing tissue of the corpus callosum during the 1st year after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and relate findings to outcome. Fifty-seven patients (mean age 34 [range 11-63] years) with moderate to severe TBI were examined with diffusion weighted MRI at three time points (median 7 days, 3 and 12 months), and a sex- and age-matched control group of 47 healthy individuals, were examined once. The corpus callosum was subdivided and the mean ADC values computed blinded in 10 regions of interests without any visible lesions in the ADC map. Outcome measures were Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) and neuropsychological domain scores at 12 months. We found a gradual increase of the mean ADC values during the 12 month follow-up, most evident in the posterior truncus (r=0.19, p<0.001). Compared with the healthy control group, we found higher mean ADC values in posterior truncus both at 3 months (p=0.021) and 12 months (p=0.003) post-injury. Patients with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesions in the corpus callosum in the early MRI, and patients with disability (GOSE score 6) showed evidence of increased mean ADC values in the genu and posterior truncus at 12 months. Mean ADC values in posterior parts of the corpus callosum at 3 months predicted the sensory-motor function domain score (p=0.010-0.028). During the 1st year after moderate and severe TBI, we demonstrated a slowly evolving disruption of the microstructure in normal appearing corpus callosum in the ADC map, most evident in the posterior truncus. The mean ADC values were associated with both outcome and ability to perform speeded, complex sensory-motor action.

N2  -  Metronidazole can cause adverse effects both in the central and peripheral nervous system. We report a 34-year-old female who presented a reversible cerebellar syndrome and peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect associated with the use of metronidazole. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintense T2 and FLAIR bilateral symmetrical cerebellar lesions, without contrast enhancement or mass effect, isointense in diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense in apparent diffusion coefficient sequences. Also, electrophysiological evaluation was consistent with axonal polyneuropathy. She had received metronidazole for a liver abscess during 49 days. After discontinuation of metronidazole, she had rapid regression of cerebellar symptoms and normalization of MRI, with subsequent disappearance of peripheral symptoms. The brain MRI, electromyography and nerve conduction studies performed at 35 months later showed complete resolution of the lesions. Although metronidazole neurotoxicity is a rare event, it must be borne in mind because the prognosis is usually favorable after stopping the drug.

N2  -  In this study, we present a new three-dimensional (3D), diffusion-prepared turbo spin echo sequence based on a stimulated-echo read-out (DPsti-TSE) enabling high-resolution and undistorted diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). A dephasing gradient in the diffusion preparation module and rephasing gradients in the turbo spin echo module create stimulated echoes, which prevent signal loss caused by eddy currents. Near to perfect agreement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between DPsti-TSE and diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DW-EPI) was demonstrated in both phantom transient signal experiments and phantom imaging experiments. High-resolution and undistorted DPsti-TSE was demonstrated in vivo in prostate and carotid vessel wall. 3D whole-prostate DWI was achieved with four b values in only 6 min. Undistorted ADC maps of the prostate peripheral zone were obtained at low and high imaging resolutions with no change in mean ADC values [(1.60 +/- 0.10) x 10(-3) versus (1.60 +/- 0.02) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s]. High-resolution 3D DWI of the carotid vessel wall was achieved in 12 min, with consistent ADC values [(1.40 +/- 0.23) x 10(-3) mm2/s] across different subjects, as well as slice locations through the imaging volume. This study shows that DPsti-TSE can serve as a robust 3D diffusion-weighted sequence and is an attractive alternative to the traditional two-dimensional DW-EPI approaches.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The utility of virtual and augmented reality based on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for glioma surgery has not been previously investigated.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 79 glioma patients and 55 control subjects. Preoperatively, the lesion and related eloquent structures were visualized by diffusion tensor tractography and blood oxygen leveledependent functional MRI. Intraoperatively, microscope- based functional neuronavigation was used to integrate the reconstructed eloquent structure and the real head and brain, which enabled safe resection of the lesion. Intraoperative MRI was used to verify brain shift during the surgical process and provided quality control during surgery. The control group underwent surgery guided by anatomic neuronavigation.; RESULTS: Virtual and augmented reality protocols based on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI provided useful information for performing tailored and optimized surgery. Complete resection was achieved in 55 of 79 (69.6%) glioma patients and 20 of 55 (36.4%) control subjects, with average resection rates of 95.2% +- 8.5% and 84.9% +- 15.7%, respectively. Both the complete resection rate and average extent of resection differed significantly between the 2 groups (P < 0.01). Postoperatively, the rate of preservation of neural functions (motor, visual field, and language) was lower in controls than in glioma patients at 2 weeks and 3 months (P < 0.01).; CONCLUSION: Combining virtual and augmented reality based on functional neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI can facilitate resection of gliomas involving eloquent areas.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides excellent soft tissue differentiation and in vivo assessment of physiologic and metabolic properties of tissue. As new and more aggressive treatment modalities and combined modalities are being investigated for brain tumor treatment, it is becoming more important to accurately define tumor volumes for treatment planning, to determine the most aggressive tumor regions for intensified radiation treatment, to identify early regional response to therapy for reoptimization of treatment, and to detect early indicators of developing normal tissue toxicity. Readily available MR techniques of physiologic and metabolic imaging can currently provide useful information regarding tumor tissue properties including chemical composition, cerebral blood volume, perfusion, vascular permeability, and water mobility. This article will focus on the potential value of MR physiologic and metabolic imaging in the clinical management of malignant gliomas.

N2  -  A modern challenge for neuroimaging techniques is to contribute to the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early diagnosis includes recognition of pre-demented conditions, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or having a high risk of developing AD. The role of neuroimaging therefore extends beyond its traditional role of excluding other conditions such as neurosurgical lesions. In addition, early diagnosis would allow early treatment using currently available therapies or new therapies in the future. Structural imaging can detect and follow the time course of subtle brain atrophy as a surrogate marker for pathological processes. New MR techniques and image analysis software can detect subtle brain microstructural, perfusion or metabolic changes that provide new tools to study the pathological processes and detect pre-demented conditions. This review focuses on markers of macro- and microstructural, perfusion, diffusion and metabolic MR imaging and spectroscopy in AD.

N2  -  The developed magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) can visualize the internal conductivity distribution at Larmor frequency by measuring the B1 transceive phase data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The recovered high-frequency conductivity (HFC) value is highly complex and heterogeneous in a macroscopic imaging voxel. Using high and low b-value diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data, the multi-compartment spherical mean technique (MC-SMT) characterizes the water molecule movement within and between intra- and extra-neurite compartments by analyzing the microstructures and underlying architectural organization of brain tissues. The proposed method decomposes the recovered HFC into the conductivity values in the intra- and extra-neurite compartments via the recovered intra-neurite volume fraction (IVF) and the diffusion patterns using DWI data. As a form of decomposition of intra- and extra-neurite compartments, the problem to determine the intra- and extra-neurite conductivity values from the HFC is still an underdetermined inverse problem. To solve the underdetermined problem, we use the compartmentalized IVF as a criterion to decompose the electrical properties because the ion-concentration and mobility have different characteristics in the intra- and extra-neurite compartments. The proposed method determines a representative apparent intra- and extra-neurite conductivity values by changing the underdetermined equation for a voxel into an over-determined minimization problem over a local window consisting of surrounding voxels. To suppress the noise amplification and estimate a feasible conductivity, we define a diffusion pattern distance to weight the over-determined system in the local window. To quantify the proposed method, we conducted a simulation experiment. The simulation experiments show the relationships between the noise reduction and the spatial resolution depending on the designed local window sizes and diffusion pattern distance. Human brain experiments (five young healthy volunteers and a patient with brain tumor) were conducted to evaluate and validate the reliability of the proposed method. To quantitatively compare the results with previously developed methods, we analyzed the errors for reconstructed extra-neurite conductivity using existing methods and indirectly verified the feasibility of the proposed method.

N2  -  Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors with poor prognosis. In this study, we report a novel approach combining both in vivo multi-parametric MRI and in vitro cell culture assessments to evaluate the pathogenic development of gliomas. Osteopontin (OPN), a pleiotropic factor, has been implicated in the formation and progression of various human cancers, including gliomas, through its functions in regulating cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and migration. Using rat C6 glioma model, the combined approach successfully monitors the acquisition and decrease of cancer hallmarks. We show that knockdown of the expression of OPN reduces C6 cell proliferation, survival, viability and clonogenicity in vitro, and reduces tumor burden and prolongs animal survival in syngeneic rats. OPN depletion is associated with reduced tumor growth, decreased angiogenesis, and an increase of tumor-associated metabolites, as revealed by T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, K-trans maps, and 1H-MRS, respectively. These strategies allow us to define an important role of OPN in conferring cancer hallmarks, which can be further applied to assess the functional roles of other candidate genes in glioma. In particular, the non-invasive multi-parametric MRI measurement of cancer hallmarks related to proliferation, angiogenesis and altered metabolism may serve as a useful tool for diagnosis and for patient management.

N2  -  This study aimed to determine the potential value of intravoxel water diffusion heterogeneity imaging for brain tumor characterization and evaluation of high-grade gliomas, by comparing an established heterogeneity index (a value) measured in human high-grade gliomas to those of normal appearing white and grey matter landmarks. Twenty patients with high-grade gliomas prospectively underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging using multiple b-values. The stretched-exponential model was used to generate a and distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) maps. The a values and DDCs of the tumor and contralateral anatomic landmarks were measured in each patient. Differences between a values of tumors and landmark tissues were assessed using paired t-tests. Correlation between tumor a and tumor DDC was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Mean a of tumors was significantly lower than that of contralateral frontal white matter (p=0.0249), basal ganglia (p<0.0001), cortical grey matter (p<0.0001), and centrum semiovale (p=0.0497). Correlation between tumor a and tumor DDC was strongly negative (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.8493; p<0.0001). The heterogeneity index a of human high-grade gliomas is significantly different from those of normal brain structures, which potentially offers a new method for evaluating brain tumors. The observed negative correlation between tumor a and tumor DDC requires further investigation. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Objective. To evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) featuring constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography in tracking the extracranial course of the facial nerve to provide a reliable facial nerve map to facilitate well-tolerated and effective tumor resection.
Study Design. Magnetic resonance DWI was conducted on 2 parotid-healthy cadaveric patients with various protocols to identify the best representation of the extracranial facial nerve tract. This was subsequently correlated to dissection of the facial nerves to ascertain anatomic validation. These protocols were applied to 2 live, parotid-healthy patients to assess feasibility of in vivo facial nerve tract identification.; Results. Correlations between imaged tracts and the anatomic course of the extracranial facial nerve were identified to an accuracy of 1 mm. The main trunk and bifurcation tracts were identified on imaging. Fractional anisometry values in cadaveric and live patients were within the range expected for the facial nerve within the parotid gland.; Conclusions. Our results indicated the potential for accurate 3-dimensional visualization of the extracranial course of the facial nerve, which could have diagnostic implications in differentiating benign from malignant tumors and, crucially, neural involvement. Preoperative planning applications of DWI could help in planning surgical approaches and providing focused counseling.

N2  -  Background: Recently, we characterized a Gamma Knife r radiation necrosis mouse model with various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols to identify biomarkers useful in differentiation from tumors. Though the irradiation was focal to one hemisphere, a contralateral injury was observed that appeared to be localized in the white matter only. Interestingly, this injury was identifiable in T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps, but not on post-contrast T1-weighted images. This observation of edema independent of vascular changes is akin to the perilesional edema seen in clinical radiation necrosis.
Findings: The pathology underlying the observed white-matter MRI changes was explored by performing immunohistochemistry for healthy axons and myelin. The presence of both healthy axons and myelin was reduced in the contralateral white-matter lesion.; Conclusions: Based on our immunohistochemical findings, the contralateral white-matter injury is most likely due to axonal degeneration.

N2  -  We attempted to investigate the potential role for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to diagnose trilateral retinoblastoma (TRb) by retrospectively reviewing brain magnetic resonance images of retinoblastoma patients. Observations: The median ADC measured 620.95 for TRb (n=6) and 1238.5 for normal pineal gland in bilateral retinoblastoma (n=8). Monitoring ADC trends aided in establishing the appropriate diagnoses in 3 patients (2 TRb, 1 benign pineal cyst). Conclusions: Our results provide baseline reference data and describe the importance of downward trending ADC which should prompt consideration of TRb. Unchanged high/nonrestricted values (>1000) may distinguish those with benign pineal tissue and obviate invasive neurosurgical procedures.

N2  -  Cerebral embolization is still a major concern in patients undergoing transfemoral carotid artery stenting. Intraoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), two techniques currently used to study this phenomenon, have provided data suggesting the importance of aortic arch catheterization in determining the overall embolic load observed during this procedure. In order to reduce this cerebral embolization, some Authors have proposed the performance of carotid artery stenting through a cervical access, either surgical or percutaneous. We review in this article the available TCD and DW-MRI data supporting transcervical CAS, along with its clinical results.

N2  -  Brain injury in sickle cell disease (SCD) comprises a wide spectrum of neurological damage. Neurocognitive deficits have been described even without established neurological lesions. DTI is a rapid, noninvasive, and non-contrast method that enables detection of normal-appearing white matter lesions not detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of the study was to evaluate if stem cell transplantation can revert white matter lesions in patients with SCD. Twenty-eight SCD patients were evaluated with MRI and DTI before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with 26 healthy controls (HC). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity maps, global efficiency, path length, and clustering coefficients. Compared to HC, SCD patients had a lower FA (p = 0.0086) before HSCT. After HSCT, FA increased and was not different from healthy controls (p = 0.1769). Mean MD, RD, and AD decreased after HSCT (p = 0.0049; p = 0.0029; p = 0.0408, respectively). We confirm previous data of white matter lesions in SCD and present evidence that HSCT promotes recovery of brain injury with potential improvement of brain structural connectivity.

N2  -  Neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the care of patients with infiltrating gliomas, in whom imaging changes are often the first indications of tumor response or progression. Unfortunately, evaluation of glioma response is often not straightforward, even for experienced radiologists. Post-surgical or radiation-related changes may mimic the appearance of disease progression, while medications such as corticosteroids and antiangiogenic agents may mimic tumor response without truly arresting tumor growth or improving patient survival. Immunotherapy response can result in inflammatory changes which manifest as progressively increasing tumor enhancement and edema over months. Many of these pitfalls can be minimized or avoided altogether by the use of modern brain tumor response criteria, while others will require new imaging tools before they can be fully addressed. Advanced MRI methods and novel positron emission tomography (PET) agents are proving important for this purpose, and their role will undoubtedly continue to grow in the future.

N2  -  Purpose: Automated lesion segmentation is increasingly used in acute ischemic stroke magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We explored in detail the performance of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholding for delineating baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions.
Methods: Retrospective, exploratory analysis of the prospective observational single-center 1000Plus study from September 2008 to June 2013 (clinicaltrials. org; NCT00715533). We built a fully automated lesion segmentation algorithm using a fixed ADC threshold (<= 620 x 10(-6) mm(2)s) to delineate the baseline DWI lesion and analyzed its performance compared to manual assessments. Diagnostic capabilities of best possible ADC thresholds were investigated using receiver operating characteristic curves. Influential patient factors on ADC thresholding techniques' performance were studied by conducting multiple linear regression.; Results: 108 acute ischemic stroke patients were selected for analysis. The median Dice coefficient for the algorithm was 0.43 (IQR 0.20-0.64). Mean ADC values in the DWI lesion (beta = -0.68, p < 0.001) and DWI lesion volumes (beta = 0.29, p < 0.001) predicted performance. Optimal individual ADC thresholds differed between subjects with a median of <= 691 x 10(-6) mm(2)s (IQR <= 660-750 x 10(-6) mm(2)s). Mean ADC values in the DWI lesion (beta = -0.96, p < 0.001) and mean ADC values in the brain parenchyma (beta = 0.24, p < 0.001) were associated with the performance of individual thresholds.; Conclusion: The performance of ADC thresholds for delineating acute stroke lesions varies substantially between patients. It is influenced by factors such as lesion size as well as lesion and parenchymal ADC values. Considering the inherent noisiness of ADC maps, ADC threshold-based automated delineation of very small lesions is not reliable.

N2  -  Background: The regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to propofol and indomethacin may be abnormal in patients with brain tumors. First, the authors tested the hypothesis that during propofol anesthesia alone and combined with indomethacin, changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and plasma mean transit time (MTT) differ in the peritumoral tissue compared with the contralateral normal brain region. Second, the authors tested the hypothesis that CBF and CBV are reduced and MTT is prolonged, in both regions during propofol anesthesia and indomethacin administration compared with propofol alone.
Methods: The authors studied eight patients subjected to craniotomy under propofol-fentanyl anesthesia for supratentorial brain tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted and structural sequences, was performed (1) on the day before surgery, (2) before and (3) after administration of indomethacin in the propofol-fentanyl anesthetized patient, and (4) 2 days after surgery. Maps of CBF, CBV, and MTT were calculated. The regions of interest were peritumoral gray matter and opposite contralateral gray matter, Analysis of variance was used to analyze flow data.; Results: Propofol anesthesia was associated with a median 32% (range, 3-61%) and 47% (range, 17-67%) reduction in CBF in the peritumoral and contralateral regions, respectively. The interaction between intervention with propofol and indomethacin and region of interest was not significant for any flow modalities. Neither intervention nor region was significant for MTT, CBF, and CBV (P > 0.05).; Conclusion: The CBF, CBV, and MTT responses to propofol and indomethacin are not different in the peritumoral region compared with contralateral brain tissue. Indomethacin did not further influence regional CBF, CBV, and MTT during propofol anesthesia.

N2  -  The present experiments were carried out to provide direct in vivo evidence for the involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the induction of ischemic brain injury. Malonate, which produces lesions similar to those of focal ischemia-reperfusion by a reversible inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase in mitochondria, was injected into the left striatum in the rat brain without or with the simultaneous injection of a cell permeable peptidic JNK inhibitor, (L)-HIV-TAT(48-57)-PP-JP-JBD(20). Two regions of malonate-induced brain injury were visualized as a hyperintense region with surrounding hypointense regions by apparent diffusion coefficient mapping magnetic resonance imaging. The INK inhibitor significantly counteracted both hyper- and hypointense regions at the early stage of brain injury. Histological examination clarified that the inhibitor suppressed the induction of coagulation necrosis and spongy degeneration at early and late stages. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Diffuse astrocytomas of the adult cerebral hemispheres are unique among tumours in human beings in the extent to which their imaging features are related to histopathological characteristics and clinical behaviour. However, understanding is still restricted about the value of imaging features in the measurement of response and of progression in these tumours. The present approach used in clinical trials, which consists of an anatomical measurement of the enhancing tumour on MRI, has many problems, and might not be acceptable as a surrogate endpoint for survival in patients with glioblastoma who are enrolled in clinical trials. Dynamic imaging techniques, such as capillary permeability mapping, are being used in studies of new drugs that target specific molecular features of gliomas; however, the validity of these techniques has not been elucidated. Diffusion imaging can be valuable for fibre-tract mapping to assist surgical planning and might become useful in measuring early response to treatment in densely cellular tumours. Functional imaging techniques can be used to localise motor, sensory, and language-control areas before surgery. Intraoperative MRI has produced improvements in the extent of tumour resection, and molecular imaging is another technique on the horizon, which could come to have a role in clinical trials in the near future. Thus, as a rapidly expanding sphere of investigation, brain-tumour imaging is producing great excitement. The aim of these new techniques is to aid the identification of more effective treatments.

N2  -  Four patients with longstanding tectal tumors are included in this study. The tectal lesion in a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patient was due to a hamartoma, while others represented gliomas. On spectroscopy, decreased NAA peaks with resultant decreases in the NAA/Cho, and NAA/Cr ratios were observed in two patients. In three patients, on diffusion MRI the tectal tumors were hyperintense on b=1000 s/mm(2) (heavily diffusion-weighted) images. On apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, they had high signal, and high ADC values (mean = 1.20 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), compared to normal cerebral parenchyma. Diffusion MRI findings suggested that tectal tumors had a relatively high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (high-signal on b=1000 s/mm(2) images) in association with a relatively loose intercellular matrix (high ADC values).

N2  -  Introduction: The two most common infectious causes of ring-enhancing lesions are neurocysticercosis (NCC) and tuberculoma. It is a challenge to differentiate NCC and tuberculomas radiologically since they show the same imaging findings on computed tomography (CT). Hence, this study was performed to assess the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an additional advanced modality to aptly characterize the lesion. Conventional MRI with additional advanced imaging sequences like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) aids in characterizing the lesion and helps in differentiating NCC and tuberculomas.
Objectives: To compare the findings of DWI, ADC cut-off values, spectroscopy, and contrast-enhanced MRI in differentiating NCC from tuberculoma.; Materials and methods: Individuals who matched the inclusion criterion underwent an MRI of the brain (plain and contrast) in a 1.5 Tesla, 18-channel, magnetic resonance scanner (Magnetom Avanto (R), Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The following imaging sequences were included: T1WI (axial and sagittal), T2-weighted imaging (axial and coronal), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, DWI at 0, 500, and 1000 mm(2)s b-values with corresponding ADC values, and single-voxel MRS. Based on MRI features such as number, size, location, margins of lesions, scolex, surrounding edema, DWI features with corresponding ADC values, enhancement pattern of lesions, and spectroscopy findings, we evaluated and differentiated the lesions as NCC or tuberculoma. Radiological diagnoses were correlated in terms of clinical symptoms and response to treatment.; Results: In our study, 42 subjects were included, of which the total number of NCC cases was 25 (59.52%) and tuberculoma was 17 (40.47%). The mean age of patients included was 42.85 +- 14.76 years (21 to 78 years). On post-contrast imaging, all 25 cases of NCC (100%) showed thin ring enhancement whereas the majority of tuberculomas (64.7%) showed thick irregular ring enhancement. On MRS, all 25 cases (100%) of NCC showed an amino acid peak and all 17 cases (100%) of tuberculoma showed a lipid lactate peak. On DWI, out of 25 NCC cases, restriction of diffusion was absent in the majority of cases (88%) and out of 17 cases of tuberculoma, restriction of diffusion was present in 12 cases (70.5%) (T2 hyperintense tuberculoma, indicative of caseating tuberculoma with central liquefaction) and was absent in the rest. In our study, the mean ADC value of NCC lesions (1.30 +- 0.137 x 10(-3) mm(2) s) was found to be greater than that of tuberculoma (0.74 +- 0.090 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). ADC value of 1.2 x 10(-3) was obtained as a cut-off to differentiate NCC and tuberculoma. The ADC cut-off value of 1.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)s showed a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 94.1% in differentiating NCC from tuberculoma.; Conclusions: Conventional MRI with additional advanced imaging sequences like DWI, ADC, MRS, and postcontrast T1WI aids in characterizing the lesion and thereby helps in differentiating NCC and tuberculomas. Hence, multiparametric MRI assessment is useful in making a prompt diagnosis and eliminating the need for a biopsy.

N2  -  Purpose: To develop a murine model of radiation necrosis using fractionated, subtotal cranial irradiation; and to investigate the imaging signature of radiation-induced tissue damage using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques.
Methods and Materials: Twenty-four mice each received 60 Gy of hemispheric (left) irradiation in 10 equal fractions. Magnetic resonance images at 4.7 T were subsequently collected using T1-, T2-, and diffusion sequences at selected time points after irradiation. After imaging, animals were killed and their brains fixed for correlative histologic analysis.; Results: Contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images at months 2, 3, and 4 showed changes consistent with progressive radiation necrosis. Quantitatively, mean diffusivity was significantly higher (mean = 0.86, 1.13, and 1.24 mu m(2)ms at 2,3, and 4 months, respectively) in radiated brain, compared with contralateral untreated brain tissue (mean = 0.78, 0.82, and 0.83 mu m(2)ms) (p < 0.0001). Histology reflected changes typically seen in radiation necrosis.; Conclusions: This murine model of radiation necrosis will facilitate investigation of imaging biomarkers that distinguish between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence. In addition, this preclinical study supports clinical data suggesting that diffusion-weighted imaging may be helpful in answering this diagnostic question in clinical settings.

N2  -  Background: Identifying the ischemic penumbra in acute stroke subjects is important for the clinical decision making process. The aim of this study was to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance singal (fMRI) to investigate the change in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of these subjects in three different subsections of acute stroke regions: the infarct core tissue, the penumbra tissue, and the normal brain tissue. Another aim of this study was to test the feasilbility of consistently detecting the penumbra region of the brain through ALFF analysis.
Methods: Sixteen subjects with first-ever acute ischemic stroke were scanned within 27 hours of the onset of stroke using magnetic resonance imaging. The core of infarct regions and penumbra regions were determined by diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging respectively. The ALFF were measured from resting-state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans. The averaged relative ALFF value of each regions were correlated with the time after the onset of stroke.; Results: Relative ALFF values were significantly different in the infarct core tissue, penumbra tissue and normal brain tissue. The locations of lesions in the ALFF maps did not match perfectly with diffusion and perfusion-weighted imagings; however, these maps provide a contrast that can be used to differentiate between penumbra brain tissue and normal brain tissue. Significant correlations between time after stroke onset and the relative ALFF values were present in the penumbra tissue but not in the infarct core and normal brain tissue.; Conclusion: Preliminary results from this study suggest that the ALFF reflects the underlying neurovascular activity and has a great potential to estimate the brain tissue viability after ischemia. Results also show that the ALFF may contribute to acute stroke imaging for thrombolytic or neuroprotective therapies.

N2  -  In this study, we combined advanced MR techniques to explore primary motor cortex (M I) connectivity in the human brain. We matched functional and anatomical information using motor functional MRI (fMRI) and white matter tractography inferred from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed coregistered DTI and motor task fMRI in 8 right-handed healthy subjects and in I right-handed patient presenting with a left precentral tumour. We used the fast-marching tractography (FMT) algorithm to define 3D connectivity maps within the whole brain, from seed points selected in the white matter adjacent to the location of the maximum of fMRI activation. Connectivity maps were then anatomically normalised and analysed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM99) allowing group comparisons (left versus right hemisphere in control subjects and patient versus control subjects). The results demonstrated, in all control subjects, strong connections from M I to the pyramidal tracts, premotor areas, parietal cortices, thalamus, and cerebellum. M I connectivity was asymmetric, being more extensive in the dominant hemisphere. The patient had differences in M1 connectivity from the control group. Thus, fMRI-correlated DTI-FMT is a promising tool to study the structural basis of functional networks in the human brain in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background and purpose: To investigate the feasibility of using a multiapproach analysis combining clin-ical data, diffusion-and perfusion-weighted imaging, and 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging to distinguish true tumor progression (TP) from pseudoprogression (PSP) in patients with glioblastoma. Materials and methods: Progression was suspected within 6 months of radiotherapy in 46 of the 180 patients included in the Phase-III SpectroGlio trial (NCT01507506). Choline/creatine (Cho/Cr), choline/ N-acetyl aspartate (Cho/NAA) and lactate/N-acetyl aspartate (Lac/NAA) ratios were extracted. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were calculated. ADC, relative CBV val-ues and tumor volume (TV) were collected at relapse. Differences between TP and PSP were evaluated using Mann-Whitney tests, and p values were adjusted with Bonferroni correction.Results: Patients with suspected progression underwent a new MRI scan 1 month after the first one. Of these, 28 were classified as PSP, and 18 as TP. After a median follow-up of 41 months, median overall sur-vival was higher in PSP than in TP (25.2 vs 20.3 months; p = 0.0092). Lac/NAA and Cho/Cr ratios were higher in TP than in PSP (1.2 vs 0.5; p = 0.006; and 3 vs 2.2; p = 0.021). After multivariate regression anal-ysis, TV was the most significant predictor of TP vs PSP, and the only one retained in the model (p = 0.028).Conclusion: Three spectroscopic ratios could be used to differentiate PSP from TP. TV at relapse was the most predictive factor in the multivariate analysis, and overall survival was higher in PSP than in TP.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of epilepsy. Studies of structural MRIs and PET data in patients with MCD have found widespread changes outside the visually identified lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate diffusion changes interictally in patients with MCD and to test the hypothesis that MCD would be associated with widespread abnormalities of diffusion. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to compare objectively tissue organization in 22 patients with partial seizures and MCD, with 30 control subjects. Whole-brain DTI was acquired using echo planar imaging, Rotationally invariant anisotropy and diffusivity maps were calculated and, after normalization to Talairach space, each patient was compared with the group of control subjects using SPM, Areas of reduced anisotropy were found in 17 patients and areas of increased diffusivity in 10, Two patients had areas of increased anisotropy, There were no patients with reduced diffusivity, Areas of increased diffusivity were in general more extensive than areas of reduced anisotropy, Changes in tissue beyond the MCD, that appeared normal on conventional MRI, were found in six patients for anisotropy and nine patients for diffusivity, Both measurements showed widespread changes in tissue beyond the MCD, i.e. adding information to conventional MRI, Increased or abnormally located grey matter or pathological white matter with abnormal myelination or ectopic neurones could cause reduced anisotropy, Increased diffusivity could be caused by a defect of neurogenesis or cell loss resulting in increased extracellular space. The widespread nature of abnormalities should be considered if surgical treatment is contemplated.

N2  -  Seizures is a comparatively common neurologic unwellness in children that has significant implications for development, parents, and society. The etiologic categories of seizures involve idiopathic, symptomatic, and cryptogenic. Pott puff tumor is a rare cause of seizures. The authors present a rare cause of the seizures.A 12-year-old boy presented with seizures. On physical examination there was swelling on his glabella. Laboratory testing indicated leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein, and microbiological testing showed the presence of pathogenic streptococcus sp. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed. T1-weighted image with gadolinium enhancement revealed frontal bone defects and subcutaneous abscess and left frontal swelling. On the diffusion-weighted imaging, the abscess has relatively homogeneous increased signal intensity b1000. The apparent diffusion coefficient map reveals low intensity. Intracranial spread also showed contrast-enhanced image (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging typically reveals an intracranial abscess.Pott puffy tumor is an unusual clinical existence characterized by osteomyelitis of the frontal bone. The very common symptoms are headache, swelling fever, and nasal discharge. Frontal sinus infection may induce osteomyelitis, subperiosteal, and epidural abscess.

N2  -  Background Corticospinal tract (CST) injury has been shown to exert a major influence on functional recovery after ischemic stroke. Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of CST injury estimated using a recent developed tractometry-based method. Study Type Prospective. Population Forty-eight patients with CST damage induced by stroke lesion who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging within 7 days from onset. Sequence Diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 1000 seconds/mm(2)) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) spin-echo echo-planar sequence with three b-values (0, 1250, and 2500 seconds/mm(2)) at 3.0 T. Assessment A recently developed approach that combines tract segmentation and orientation mapping was used for CST-specific tractography and tractometry. CST injury was estimated using the proposed method with diffusion metrics extracted from DKI sequence and with the first principal component (PC1) of the metrics. We also calculated the weighted lesion load (wLL) for comparison. Clinical evaluation included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Score in the acute phase and the modified Rankin scale at 3 months post-stroke. The correlations between CST injury and initial motor impairment, as well as the prognostic values of CST injury for functional outcomes were evaluated. Statistical Tests Pearson correlation and logistic regression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results CST injury calculated with diffusion metrics except fractional anisotropy all showed significant correlations with initial motor impairment. PC1 achieved the largest correlation coefficient (R = 0.65) compared with wLL and other diffusion metrics. In addition to wLL, DKI_AK, AFD_total, and PC1 maximum all showed predictive values for functional outcomes. Data Conclusion Structural injury to CST is important for the assessment of the extent of injury and the prediction of functional outcome. The method proposed in our study could provide an imaging indicator to quantify the CST injury after ischemic stroke. Level of Evidence 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 1

N2  -  Background: Diffusion imaging tractography is increasingly used to trace critical fiber tracts in brain tumor patients to reduce the risk of post-operative neurological deficit. However, the effects of peritumoral edema pose a challenge to conventional tractography using the standard diffusion tensor model. The aim of this study was to present a novel technique using a two-tensor unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm to track the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in brain tumor patients with peritumoral edema.
Methods: Ten right-handed patients with left-sided brain tumors in the vicinity of language-related cortex and evidence of significant peritumoral edema were retrospectively selected for the study. All patients underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including a diffusion-weighted dataset with 31 directions. Fiber tractography was performed using both single-tensor streamline and two-tensor UKF tractography. A two-regions-of-interest approach was applied to perform the delineation of the AF.; Results from the two different tractography algorithms were compared visually and quantitatively. Results: Using single-tensor streamline tractography, the AF appeared disrupted in four patients and contained few fibers in the remaining six patients. Two-tensor UKF tractography delineated an AF that traversed edematous brain areas in all patients. The volume of the AF was significantly larger on two-tensor UKF than on single-tensor streamline tractography (p < 0.01).; Conclusions: Two-tensor UKF tractography provides the ability to trace a larger volume AF than single-tensor streamline tractography in the setting of peritumoral edema in brain tumor patients.

N2  -  To increase the sensitivity of MRI parameters to detect tissue damage of ischemic stroke, an unsupervised analysis method, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA), was applied to analyze the temporal evolution of ischemic damage in a focal embolic cerebral ischemia model in rat with and without recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment.
Male Wistar rats subjected to embolic stroke were investigated using a 7-T MRI system. Rats were randomized into control (n = 9) and treated (n 9) groups. The treated rats received rt-PA via a femoral vein at 4 h after onset of embolic ischemia. ISODATA analysis employed parametric maps or weighted images (T-1, T-2, and diffusion). ISODATA results with parametric maps are superior to ISODATA with weighted images, and both of them were highly correlated with the infarction size measured from the corresponding histological section. At 24 h after embolic stroke, the average map ISODATA lesion sizes were 37.7 +- 7.0 and 39.2 +- 5.6 mm(2) for the treated and the control group, respectively. Average histological infarction areas were 37.9 +- 7.4 mm(2) for treated rats and 39.4 +- 6.1 mm(2) for controls. The R-2 values of the linear correlation between map ISODATA and histological data were 0.98 and 0.96 for treated and control rats, respectively. Both histological and map ISODATA data suggest that there is no significant difference in infarction area between non-treated and rt-PA-treated rats when treatment was administered 4 h after the onset of embolic stroke. The ISODATA lesion size analysis was also sensitive to changes of lesion size during acute and subacute stages of stroke.; Our data demonstrate that the multiparameter map ISODATA approach provides a more sensitive quantitation of the ischemic lesion at all time points than image ISODATA and single MRI parametric analysis using T-1, T-2 or ADC(w).

N2  -  Background The location of the primary motor cortex can be detected in healthy adults using the findings of 'T2 hypointensity' and the 'double layer sign' on 3 T diffusion-weighted imaging. The aim of this study was to assess whether ischemic involvement of the primary motor cortex can be identified on 3 T diffusion-weighted imaging within six-hours after stroke onset and to evaluate whether this finding could predict clinical outcome three-months after ischemic stroke.
Methods Sixty-five patients who had paralysis and ischemia of the anterior circulation underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging within six-hours of symptom onset. Follow-up MRI was obtained at 72 h. Anatomic localization and ischemic involvement of the primary motor cortex were evaluated on diffusion-weighted imaging by two investigators. Ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex was classified into three grades. Ischemic lesion volumes were measured. We compared the favorable outcomes at three-months between subjects with and without ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex using the NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale.; Results Ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex was identified in 52% of patients. Interrater agreement coefficients were 0.93 for the identification of ischemic involvement of primary motor cortex. As defined by scores on the modified Rankin Scale, among the patients with ischemic involvement of the primary motor cortex were worse than the patients without ischemic involvement of the primary motor cortex (P = 0.01). The mean ischemic lesion volume at baseline diffusion-weighted imaging was 38.7 +- 41.7 cm(3) and was 89.8 +- 93.6 cm(3) at follow-up T2-WI. Ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex (odds ratio: 14.7) was a determinant for worse outcome.; Conclusions 3T diffusion-weighted imaging can identify ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex and may provide useful information for predicting outcome during the hyperacute stage. Ischemic involvement on the primary motor cortex has a significant negative impact on recovery.

N2  -  Purpose We evaluated diffusional changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions remote from multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques by using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to investigate the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion.
Materials and methods Participants were 11 MS patients and 6 age-matched healthy volunteers. DKI was performed on a 3-T MR imager. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and diffusional kurtosis (DK) maps were computed. Regions of interest (ROIs) were compared in 24 cerebral regions, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe white matter (WM) in controls and NAWM in MS patients.; Results The mean FA of all ROIs was 0.468 +- A 0.014 (SD) (controls) or 0.431 +- A 0.029 (MS group) (P = 0.016). Mean ADC was 0.785 +- A 0.034 x 10(-3) mm(2)s (controls) or 0.805 +- A 0.041 x 10(-3) mm(2)s (MS group). The mean DK of all ROIs was 0.878 +- A 0.020 (controls) or 0.823 +- A 0.032 (MS group) (P = 0.002). Analysis of individual ROIs revealed significant differences in DK in 3 ROIs between normal WM and NAWM, but significant differences in ADC and FA in only one ROI each.; Conclusion DKI may be a new sensitive indicator for detecting tissue damage in MS patients in addition to conventional diffusional evaluations, for example diffusion tensor imaging.

N2  -  Background: Clinical 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging systems are becoming widespread. No studies have examined differences between 1.5-tesla and 3-tesla imaging for the assessment of hyperacute ischemic stroke (< 6 h from symptom onset). Our objective was to compare 1.5-tesla and 3-tesla diffusion and perfusion imaging for hyperacute stroke using optimized protocols. Methods: Three patients or their surrogate provided informed consent. Diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging ( PWI) was performed sequentially at 1.5 T and 3 T. DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) maps and relative time-to-peak ( TTP) maps were registered and assessed. DWI contrastto-noise ratio ( CNR) and ADC contrast were measured and compared. The infarct lesion volume ( ILV) and thresholded ischemic volume ( TIV) were estimated on the ADC and TTP maps, respectively, with the penumbral volume being defined as the difference between these volumes. Results: Quantitatively, the 3-tesla TTP images exhibited greater future detail. Quantitatively, DWI CNR and ILV were similar at both field strengths, the ADC contrast was greater at 3 T and the TIV and penumbral volumes were much smaller at 3T. Conclusions: Overall, the 3-tesla diffusion and perfusion images were at least as good and in some ways superior to the 1.5-tesla images for assessing hyperacute stroke. The TTP maps showed greater feature detail at 3T. The ischemic and penumbra volumes were much greater at 1.5 T, indicating a potential difference in the diagnostic utility of the PWI-DWI mismatch between field strengths. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

N2  -  SF188/V+ is a highly vascular human glioma model that is based on transfection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cDNA into SF188/V- cells. This study aims to assess its growth and vascularity properties in vivo in a rat model. Thirty-two adult rats were inoculated with SF188/V+ tumor cells, and, for comparison, five were inoculated with SF188/V- tumor cells. Several conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were acquired, and several quantitative structural (T-2 and T-1), functional [isotropic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and blood flow], and molecular [protein and peptide-based amide proton transfer (APT)] MRI parameters were mapped on a 4.7 T animal scanner. In rats inoculated with SF188/V+ tumor cells, conventional T-2-weighted images showed a highly heterogeneous tumor mass, and post-contrast T-1-weighted images showed a heterogeneous, strong enhancement of the mass. There were moderate increases in T-2, T-1, and ADC, and large increases in blood flow and APT in the tumor, compared to contralateral brain tissue. Microscopic examination revealed prominent vascularity and hemorrhage in the VEGF-secreting xenografts as compared to controls, and immunohistochemical staining confirmed increased expression of VEGF in tumor xenografts. Our results indicate that the SF188/V+ glioma model exhibits some MRI and histopathology features that closely resemble human glioblastoma.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic ?>performance of mean apparent propagator-magnetic resonance imaging (MAP-MRI) in distinguishing the grades of diffuse gliomas.
Method: Thirty-six patients with pathologically confirmed diffuse gliomas were enrolled in this study. MAP-MRI parameters were measured in the parenchymal area of the tumour: non-Gaussianity (NG), non-Gaussianity axial (NGAx), non-Gaussianity vertical (NGRad), Q-space inverse variance (QIV), return to the origin probability (RTOP), return to the axis probability (RTAP), return to the plane probability (RTPP), and mean square displacement (MSD). Differences in the parameters between any two grades were compared, the characteristics of the parameters for different diffuse glioma grades were analysed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to analyse the diagnostic value of each parameter.; Results: Compared with grade III gliomas, grade II gliomas had lower NG, NGAx and NGRad values. NG, NGAx and NGRad had great area under the ROC curve (AUC) values (0.823, 0.835, and 0.838, P < 0.05). Compared with those of grade IV glioma, the NG, NGAx, NGRad, RTAP and RTOP values for grade II glioma were lower, the QIV values were higher (all P < 0.05). NG, NGAx, NGRad, RTAP, RTOP and QIV had great area under the ROC curve (AUC) values (0.923, 0.929, 0.923,0.793,0.822, and 0.769, P < 0.05).; Conclusions: Quantitative MAP-MRI parameters can distinguish grade II and III and grade II and IV gliomas before surgery but not grade III and IV gliomas. Thus, these parameters have clinical guiding value in the noninvasive preoperative evaluation of tumour pathological grading.

N2  -  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the anatomical appearance of beta-amyloid (betaA) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These changes are also associated with cyclical inflammation, oxidative damage and, as inferred from the autopsied brains of patients, progressive injury to neurons. Here, we report the short-term effects of an intrahippocampal injection of the toxic PA peptide fragment 25-35 in rats using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Physiological changes within the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus were monitored using a 1.5 T scanner at time points of 0.25, 1 and 24 h, and 7 and 14 days post injection. Spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion weighted (DW) images were sequentially acquired. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were calculated and compared with histological alterations. A significant elevation in mean ADC values (17%) was observed in the ipsilateral CA1 at 14 days. The ADC changes were associated with disrupted pyramidal cells and nuclear lysis observed in histological sections. The contralateral CA1 exhibited a significant decrease in mean ADC of 15%, at 14 days post treatment. Histological changes in the contralateral hippocampus suggested decreased neuronal density. T2W maps revealed no significant differences between the active A 25-35 fragment and its non-active analog, betaA 35-25. In conclusion, these results, based on changes in hippocampal ADC, demonstrate that the PA 25-35 treatment induced pathology consistent with edema and cellular necrosis. This is the first report describing the evolution of AD-like pathology in an animal model using DW imaging. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is an excellent tool for diagnosing intracranial infection, with limitations in previous neurosurgical intervention. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of DWI in the diagnosis of postoperative intracranial infection.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients with intracranial infection undergoing a neurosurgical intervention who had preoperative MRI, including DWI. Patients were divided into 2 groups: spontaneous intracranial infection (SI) and postoperative intracranial infection (PI). A control group (CG) of patients who had undergone brain surgery without any signs of subsequent infection was also included. Qualitatively, MRI data were evaluated for the presence of intracranial infection. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PI as opposed to no infection were determined. Quantitatively, areas with diffusion restriction within the surgeryabscess cavity were identified for the 3 groups using semiautomated segmentation. Group differences regarding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify a point in time beyond which ADC ratios might show reasonable discriminatory power between the PI and CG groups.; RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included (38 in the SI group, 20 in the PI group, 20 in the CG group). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in the diagnosis of PI were 80%, 95%, 4%, and 100%, respectively. Median ADC was significantly higher in the PI group compared with the SI group (0.98 vs. 0.69; P < 0.001) but lower compared with the CG group (1.24; P = 0.16). The analysis suggested a possible differentiation of PI and CG after a time interval of approximately 100 days3 months.; CONCLUSIONS: DWI is of limited value in evaluating postoperative brain infection. Our data show a trend toward DWI regaining its validity at approximately 3 months after surgery.

N2  -  The applications of a new segmentation software, Anatomatic(TM), in the evaluation of volumetric measurements of brain infarctions and the new Medimag(TM) 3D software in the evaluation of 3D image representation of infarctions are described. These programs are applied to magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of these software packages in making accurate volumetric measurements in 40 patients with right cerebral infarctions, in determining the correlations between the quantitated lesions and neurological/neuropsychological dysfunctions and in creating realistic 3D views of the infarctions, Using Anatomatic(TM), reproducible infarction volumes were achieved with ease and within a reasonably fast time. Medimag(TM) helped achieve realistic 3D representations of the infarctions. When compared, the semiautomatic segmentation proved to be much faster and yielded higher infarction volumes than the manual segmentation technique. Significantly positive correlations between the infarction volumes and neurological dysfunctions and neuropsychological deficit (neglect) helped to explain the effect of volumes on the clinical status of the patients, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  -  Purpose To compare annotation segmentation approaches and to assess the value of radiomics analysis applied to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for evaluation of breast cancer receptor status and molecular subtyping. Procedures In this IRB-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 91 patients with treatment-naive breast malignancies proven by image-guided breast biopsy, (luminal A, n = 49; luminal B, n = 8; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-enriched, n = 11; triple negative [TN], n = 23) underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast at 3 T with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, T2-weighted and DW imaging. Lesions were manually segmented on high b-value DW images and segmentation ROIS were propagated to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. In addition in a subgroup (n = 79) where lesions were discernable on ADC maps alone, these were also directly segmented there. To derive radiomics signatures, the following features were extracted and analyzed: first-order histogram (HIS), co-occurrence matrix (COM), run-length matrix (RLM), absolute gradient, autoregressive model (ARM), discrete Haar wavelet transform (WAV), and lesion geometry. Fisher, probability of error and average correlation, and mutual information coefficients were used for feature selection. Linear discriminant analysis followed by k-nearest neighbor classification with leave-one-out cross-validation was applied for pairwise differentiation of receptor status and molecular subtyping. Histopathologic results were considered the gold standard. Results For lesion that were segmented on DWI and segmentation ROIs were propagated to ADC maps the following classification accuracies > 90% were obtained: luminal B vs. HER2-enriched, 94.7 % (based on COM features); luminal B vs. others, 92.3 % (COM, HIS); and HER2-enriched vs. others, 90.1 % (RLM, COM). For lesions that were segmented directly on ADC maps, better results were achieved yielding the following classification accuracies: luminal B vs. HER2-enriched, 100 % (COM, WAV); luminal A vs. luminal B, 91.5 % (COM, WAV); and luminal B vs. others, 91.1 % (WAV, ARM, COM). Conclusions Radiomic signatures from DWI with ADC mapping allows evaluation of breast cancer receptor status and molecular subtyping with high diagnostic accuracy. Better classification accuracies were obtained when breast tumor segmentations could be performed on ADC maps.

N2  -  ObjectivesParameter maps based on wavelet-transform post-processing of dynamic perfusion data offer an innovative way of visualizing blood vessels in a fully automated, user-independent way. The aims of this study were (i) a proof of concept regarding wavelet-based analysis of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data and (ii) to demonstrate advantages of wavelet-based measures compared to standard cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps in patients with the initial diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM).MethodsConsecutive 3-T DSC MRI datasets of 46 subjects with GBM (mean age 63.013.1years, 28 m) were retrospectively included in this feasibility study. Vessel-specific wavelet magnetic resonance perfusion (wavelet-MRP) maps were calculated using the wavelet transform (Paul wavelet, order 1) of each voxel time course. Five different aspects of image quality and tumor delineation were each qualitatively rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Quantitative analysis included image contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio.ResultsVessel-specific wavelet-MRP maps could be calculated within a mean time of 2:27min. Wavelet-MRP achieved higher scores compared to CBV in all qualitative ratings: tumor depiction (4.02 vs. 2.33), contrast enhancement (3.93 vs. 2.23), central necrosis (3.86 vs. 2.40), morphologic correlation (3.87 vs. 2.24), and overall impression (4.00 vs. 2.41); all p<.001. Quantitative image analysis showed a better image contrast and higher contrast-to-noise ratios for wavelet-MRP compared to conventional perfusion maps (all p<.001).Conclusionswavelet-MRP is a fast and fully automated post-processing technique that yields reproducible perfusion maps with a clearer vascular depiction of GBM compared to standard CBV maps.

N2  -  Purpose: To describe the MR findings of primary central nervous system T-cell lymphoma (T-PCNSL) in immunocompetent patients.
Material and Methods: Seven patients with pathologically proven T-PCNSL were included in our study. The number, location, shape, enhancement pattern, and signal intensity of the tumors were determined. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and perfusion-weighted images (PWI) were obtained in four and two patients, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were generated, and regions of interest were defined in each lesion.; Results: Four patients with T-PCNSL had a single mass, while the others had multiple lesions ( four, three, and two lesions, respectively). All seven cases of T-PCNSL had a supratentorial location: 12 in the subcortical area and 1 in the thalamus. No leptomeningeal involvement was noted. All tumors showed iso- to low T1 and iso- to slightly high T2 signal intensity to the adjacent gray matter. Rim enhancement was seen in 5 of the 7 patients (71.4%), while heterogeneous and homogeneous enhancement was seen in each of two. On DWI and ADC maps, the enhancing lesions showed slight hyperintensity in three patients (mean ADC ratio, 0.92 +- 0.06) and iso- intensity in the other (ADC ratio, 1.02 +- 0.05). Cystic areas consistent with necrosis were noted in three patients. High-signal intensity area in the cortex was noted on T1-weighted images in three patients, suggesting hemorrhage. In two patients, the same signal intensity area was noted within the mass. The two masses on the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map demonstrated either similar or slightly higher signal intensity than that of the contralateral white matter. The rCBV ratios of these two masses were 1.27 +- 0.16 and 1.35 +- 0.2, respectively.; Conclusion: T-PCNSLs show a predilection for a subcortical location, a relatively high incidence of cortical or intratumoral hemorrhage, rim enhancement, or cystic areas consistent with necrosis on magnetic resonance imaging. The lower rCBV ratio of the tumor might be helpful in differentiating T-PCNSL from other brain tumors such as high-grade glioma.

N2  -  Functional diffusion mapping (fDM) has shown promise as a sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting survival in initial studies consisting of a small number of patients, mixed tumor grades, and before routine use of anti-angiogenic therapy. The current study tested whether fDM performed before and after radiochemotherapy could predict progression-free and overall survival in 143 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from 2007 through 2010, many treated with anti-angiogenic therapy after recurrence. Diffusion and conventional Mill scans were obtained before and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and concurrent temozolomide treatment. FDM was created by coregistering pre- and posttreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and then performing voxel-wise subtraction. FDMs were categorized according to the degree of change in ADC in pre- and posttreatment fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast-enhancing regions. The volume fraction of fDM-classified increasing ADC(+), decreasing ADC(-), and change in ADC(+/-) were tested to determine whether they were predictive of survival. Both Bonferroni-corrected univariate log-rank analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated that patients with decreasing ADC in a large volume fraction of pretreatment FLAIR or contrast-enhancing regions were statistically more likely to progress earlier and expire sooner than in patients with a lower volume fraction. The current study supports the hypothesis that fDM is a sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting survival in glioblastoma.

N2  -  Background and purpose - The differentiation of epidermoid cysts from other intracranial lesions with CT and conventional MR imaging is challenging. The risk of residual and recurrent disease is high and multimodal imaging should therefore promote a precise differential diagnosis. Since epidermoid cysts are histologically identical to middle ear cholesteatomas, MRI methods that are useful in the diagnosis of cholesteatoma; specifically EPI DWI and a non-EPI diffusion subtype (HASTE DWI) may possibly be applicable to epidermoid cysts. Besides testing the diagnostic utility of these methods on epidermoid cysts, our goal was to quantify the T1 and T2 relaxation times, the ADC values and the magnetization transfer ratios in order to acquire objective, characteristic information about their structure and contents. Finally, our goal was to provide the physician with a reliable, multimodal diagnostic tool that supports accurate surgical planning.
Methods - Two patients with epidermoid cysts were examined. Besides the conventional MR scans EPI DWI, HASTE DWI, quantitative T1, T2 and magnetization transfer measurements were performed mappingwith a 3T MR scanner. After image registration, T1, T2 relaxation times and the magnetization transfer ratio inside a ROI were determined according to the lesion location on HASTE DWI. Mean ADC values inside the epidermoid cysts were also calculated by both mono-exponential and bi-exponential diffusion models.; Results - Our results revealed relatively high T1 and T2 relaxation times and ADC values, and low magnetization transfer ratios in both subjects.; Conclusion - HASTE-DW MRI provides accurate morphologic information on epidermoid cysts, while T1, T2, ADC and magnetization transfer ratio maps are quantitative techniques. Thus the combination of these methods results in a confident preoperative diagnosis and aids to determine the indication of retreatment in the event of recurrence.

N2  -  Background and purpose: As the usefulness of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained from diffusion-weighted images (DWI) for the differential diagnosis between glioblastoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma is controversial, we assessed whether high b-value DWI at b 4000 s/mm(2) could discriminate between glioblastoma and lymphoma. We also compared the power of high-and standard b-value (b-4000, b-1000) imaging on a 3-Tesla (3 T) magnetic resonance (MR) instrument.
Materials and methods: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. We acquired DWI at 3 T with b = 1000 and b = 4000 smm(2) in 10 patients with lymphoma and 14 patients with glioblastoma. The ADC was measured by placing multiple regions of interest (ROI) on ADC maps of the site of enhanced lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images. We avoided hemorrhagic and cystic lesions by using T1-, T2-, FLAIR-, and T2* MR images. The ADC values of each tumor were determined preoperatively from several ROI and expressed as the minimum-, mean-, and maximum ADC value (ADC(MIN), ADC(MEAN), ADC(MAX)). We evaluated the relationship between ADCs and histological information including tumor cellularity.; Results: All ADC values were statistically associated with tumor cellularity. ADCMIN at b-4000 was associated with tumor cellularity more significantly than ADC(MIN) at b-1000. All ADC values were lower for lymphoma than glioblastoma and the statistical difference was larger at b = 4000- than b = 1000 smm(2). According to the results of discriminant analysis, the log likelihood was greatest for ADC(MIN) at b = 4000. At a cut-off value of ADC(MIN) = 0.500 x 10(-3) mm(2)s at b-4000 it was possible to differentiate between lymphoma and glioblastoma (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 91.7%).; Conclusions: Calculating the ADC value is useful for distinguishing lymphoma from glioblastoma. The lowest degree of overlapping and a better inverse correspondence with tumor cellularity were obtained with ADC(MIN) at b-4000 smm(2) at 3 T MRI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  The emergency management of cerebral concussion typically centers on the decision to perform a head computed tomography (CT) scan, which only rarely detects hemorrhagic lesions requiring neurosurgery. The absence of hemorrhage on CT scan often is equated with a lack of brain injury. However, observational studies revealing poor long-term cognitive outcome after concussion suggest that brain injury may be present despite a normal CT scan. To explore this idea further, the authors reviewed the evidence for objective neurologic injury in humans after concussion, with particular emphasis on those with a normal brain CT. This evidence comes from studies involving brain tissue pathology, CT scanning, magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning, serum biomarkers, formal cognitive and balance tests, functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography scanning. Each section is accompanied by technical information to help the reader understand what these tests are, not to endorse their use clinically. The authors discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence in each case. These reports make a compelling case for the existence of concussion as a clinically relevant disease with demonstrable neurologic pathology. Areas for future emergency medicine research are suggested.

N2  -  Purpose Meningiomas are mainly benign tumors, though a considerable proportion shows aggressive behaviors histologically consistent with atypia/anaplasia. Histopathological grading is usually assessed through invasive procedures, which is not always feasible due to the inaccessibility of the lesion or to treatment contraindications. Therefore, we propose a multi-parametric MRI assessment as a predictor of meningioma histopathological grading. Methods Seventy-three patients with 74 histologically proven and previously treated meningiomas were retrospectively enrolled (42 WHO I, 24 WHO II, 8 WHO III) and studied with MRI including T2 TSE, FLAIR, Gradient Echo, DWI, and pre- and post-contrast T1 sequences. Lesion masks were segmented on post-contrast T1 sequences and rigidly registered to ADC maps to extract quantitative parameters from conventional DWI and intravoxel incoherent motion model assessing tumor perfusion. Two expert neuroradiologists assessed morphological features of meningiomas with semi-quantitative scores. Results Univariate analysis showed different distributions (p < 0.05) of quantitative diffusion parameters (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and morphological features (Pearson's chi-square; Fisher's exact test) among meningiomas grouped in low-grade (WHO I) and higher grade forms (WHO II/III); the only exception consisted of the tumor-brain interface. A multivariate logistic regression, combining all parameters showing statistical significance in the univariate analysis, allowed discrimination between the groups of meningiomas with high sensitivity (0.968) and specificity (0.925). Heterogeneous contrast enhancement and low ADC were the best independent predictors of atypia and anaplasia. Conclusion Our multi-parametric MRI assessment showed high sensitivity and specificity in predicting histological grading of meningiomas. Such an assessment may be clinically useful in characterizing lesions without histological diagnosis.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Distinguishing tumor recurrence from therapy-induced imaging changes (TIIC) on brain MRI in children treated for primary malignant brain tumors may be challenging. The authors aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of multimodal MRI in differentiating TIIC from tumor recurrence.METHODS The authors retrospectively included children with abnormal supratentorial brain MRI findings after treat- ment for primary malignant brain tumors (regardless of their localization) with complete resection and radiotherapy. A total of 18 patients with TIIC and 25 patients with tumor recurrence were compared, according to structural, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging data accrued over time. TIIC were defined by a new MRI scan that was stable for at least 1 year or had regressed, or by histopathology findings in specimens obtained when the anomaly was surgically treated.RESULTS The time interval between completion of radiotherapy and the appearance of abnormal brain MRI findings was significantly shorter in the TIIC group compared with the tumor recurrence group (median 6 vs 35 months; p < 0.001). TIIC appeared as foci of increased T2-weighted signal intensity, without nodule, associated with variable contrast enhancement. Tumor recurrence appeared as a well-defined nodule with intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images with nodular contrast enhancement. Relative ADC values were significantly higher in the TIIC group (median 1.43 vs 0.88; p < 0.001). Relative ASL-cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were significantly lower in the TIIC group (me- dian 0.27 vs 0.43; p = 0.04). On follow-up MRI, TIIC could progress, regress, or remain stable. In most instances (72%), they decreased in size or remained stable at 4 years of follow-up.CONCLUSIONS MRI features of TIIC include foci of increased signal intensity without a demonstrable nodule on T2 weighted images, high ADC values, and lower ASL-CBF values, whereas tumor recurrence appears as a well-defined nodule with low ADC values and higher ASL-CBF values.

T2  -  STROKE

N2  -  Background and Purpose-In malignant infarction, brain edema leads to secondary neurological deterioration and poor outcome. We sought to determine whether swelling is associated with outcome in smaller volume strokes.
Methods-Two research cohorts of acute stroke subjects with serial brain MRI were analyzed. The categorical presence of swelling and infarct growth was assessed on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) by comparing baseline and follow-up scans. The increase in stroke volume (Delta DWI) was then subdivided into swelling and infarct growth volumes using region-of-interest analysis. The relationship of these imaging markers with outcome was evaluated in univariable and multivariable regression.; Results-The presence of swelling independently predicted worse outcome after adjustment for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, admission glucose, and baseline DWI volume (odds ratio, 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-18.9; P<0.02). Volumetric analysis confirmed that Delta DWI was associated with outcome (odds ratio, 4.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.00-11.5; P<0.001). After partitioning Delta DWI into swelling and infarct growth volumetrically, swelling remained an independent predictor of poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.17; P<0.005). Larger infarct growth was also associated with poor outcome (odds ratio, 7.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-143; P<0.045), although small infarct growth was not. The severity of cytotoxic injury measured on apparent diffusion coefficient maps was associated with swelling, whereas the perfusion deficit volume was associated with infarct growth.; Conclusions-Swelling and infarct growth each contribute to total stroke lesion growth in the days after stroke. Swelling is an independent predictor of poor outcome, with a brain swelling volume of >= 11 mL identified as the threshold with greatest sensitivity and specificity for predicting poor outcome.

N2  -  We carried out MRI on 16 male and three female comatose patients, aged 2 days to 79 years, with suspected cortical ischaemia referred from our intensive care units. Using a head coil, and following standard imaging, including coronal fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images, we performed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using a whole-brain multislice single-shot echo-planar sequence with b 0 and 1000 s/mm(2): 5-mm slices covering the whole brain, TR 7000 TE 106 ms, 128x128 pixels, field of view 250 mm, one excitation. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were generated automatically. DWI showed cortical, basal ganglia and watershed-area high signal in all cases, associated with a decrease in ADC to 60- 80% of normal. DWI showed lesions not seen (40%) or underestimated (40%) on conventional T2-weighted imaging. Within 24 h of the onset of symptoms, DWI showed changes not readily detectable on T2-weighted images. The cortical high signal on DWI and the ADC changes, suggesting severe ischaemia rather than oedema, was found in areas known to be affected by cortical laminar necrosis. Extension to the brain stem and white matter was associated with a higher likelihood of death.

N2  -  Background. The extent of brain damage in chronic stroke patients is traditionally defined as the necrotic tissue observed on magnetic resonance image (MRI). However, patients often exhibit symptoms suggesting that functional impairment may affect areas beyond the cortical necrotic lesion, for example, when cortical symptoms ensue after subcortical damage. This observation suggests that disconnection or diaschisis can lead to remote cortical dysfunction that can be functionally equivalent to direct cortical lesions. Objective. To directly measure subcortical disconnection after stroke. Methods. We describe a principled approach utilizing the whole brain connectome reconstructed from diffusion MRI to evaluate the reduction of apparent white matter fiber density in the hemisphere affected by the stroke compared with the spared hemisphere. Results. In eight chronic stroke patients, we observed subcortical disconnection extending beyond the location of tissue necrosis and affecting major white matter pathways underlying the necrotic area. Conclusions. We suggest that it is possible to detect and quantify previously unappreciated areas of subcortical and cortical disconnection. Specifically, this method can be used to evaluate the relationship between lesion location and symptoms, with emphasis on a connectivity-based approach.

N2  -  Background and purpose: MRI images timely and accurately reflect ischemic injuries to the brain tissues and, therefore, can support clinical decision-making of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). To maximize the information provided by the MRI images, we leverage deep learning models to segment, classify, and map lesion distributions of AIS.Methods: We evaluated brain MRI images of AIS patients from 2017 to 2020 at a tertiary teaching hospital and developed the Semantic Segmentation Guided Detector Network (SGD-Net), composed of the first U-shaped model for segmentation in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the second model for binary classification of lesion size (lacune vs. non-lacune) and circulatory territory of lesion location (anterior vs. posterior circulation). Next, we modified the two-stage deep learning model into SGD-Net Plus by automatically segmenting AIS lesions in DWI images and registering the lesion in T1-weighted images and the brain atlases. Results: The final enrollment (216 patients with 4606 slices) was divided into 80% for model development and 20% for testing. S1 model segmented AIS lesions in DWI images accurately with a pixel accuracy > 99% (Dice 0.806-0.828 and IoU 0.675-707). In comprehensive evaluation of classification performance, the two-stage SGDNet outperformed the traditional one-stage models in classifying AIS lesion size (accuracy 0.867-0.956 vs. 0.511-0.867, AUROC 0.962-0.992 vs. 0.528-0.937, AUPRC 0.964-0.994 vs. 0.549-0.938) and location (accuracy 0.860-0.930 vs. 0.326-0.721, AUROC 0.936-0.988 vs. 0.493-0.833, AUPRC 0.883-0.978 vs. 0.365-0.695). The precise lesion segmentation at the first stage of the deep learning model was the basis for further application. After that, the modified two-stage model SGD-Net Plus accurately reported the volume, region percentage, and Abbreviations: AIS, Acute Ischemic Stroke; MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging; PACS, Picture Archiving , Communication System; DWI, Diffusion-Weighted Imaging; T1W, T1-Weighted imaging; SGD-Net, Semantic Segmentation Guided Detector Network; SGD-Net Plus, Semantic Segmentation Guided Detector Network Plus; SegMap, Segmented lesion Map; T2W, T2-weighted imaging; FLAIR, FLuid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery; DICOM, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine; NIFTI, Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative; S1, Stage-One; S2, Stage-Two; MPRAGE, Magnetization Prepared RApid Gradient Echo; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; VGG, Visual Geometry Group; ResNet, Residual Net; DenseNet, Dense Convolutional Network; 3D-CNNs, Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks; IoU, Intersection-over-Union; AUROC, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics; AUPRC, the Area Under the Precision -Recall Curve; ADC, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient.

N2  -  In the dual-route language model, the dorsal pathway is known for sound-to-motor mapping, but the role of the ventral stream is controversial. With the goal of enhancing our understanding of language models, this study investigated the diffusion characteristics of candidate tracts in aphasic patients. We evaluated 14 subacute aphasic patients post-stroke and 11 healthy controls with language assessment and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping found multiple linguistic associations for the ventral stream, while automated fiber quantification (AFQ) showed, via reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity with increased radial diffusivity (all corrected p < 0.05), that the integrity of both the left dorsal and ventral streams was compromised. The average diffusion metrics of each fascicle provided by AFQ also confirmed that voxels with significant FA-language correlations were located in the ventral tracts, including the left inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) (comprehension: r = 0.839, p = 0.001; repetition: r = 0.845, p = 0.001; naming: r = 0.813, p = 0.002; aphasia quotient: r = 0.847, p = 0.001) and uncinate fascicle (naming: r = 0.948, p = 0.001). Furthermore, point-wise AFQ revealed that the segment of the left IFOF with the strongest correlations was its narrow stem. The temporal segment of the left inferior longitudinal fascicle was also found to correlate significantly with comprehension (r = 0.663, p = 0.03) and repetition (r = 0.742, p = 0.009). This preliminary study suggests that white matter integrity analysis of the ventral stream may have the potential to reveal aphasic severity and guide individualized rehabilitation. The left IFOF, specifically its narrow stem segment, associates with multiple aspects of language, indicating an important role in semantic processing and multimodal linguistic functions.

N2  -  Purpose: To examine whether an objective segmenation of corticospinal tract (CST) associated with hand and leg movements can be used to detect central motor weakness in the corresponding extremities in a pediatric population.
Material and Methods: This retrospective study included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 25 children with central paresis affecting at least one limb (age: 9.0 +- 4.2 years, 15 boys, 5137 children with leftrightboth hemispheric lesions including ischemia, cyst, and gliosis), as well as 42 pediatric control subjects with no motor dysfunction (age: 9.0 +- 5.5 years, 21 boys, 31 healthy11 non-lesional epilepsy children). Leg- and hand-related CST pathways were segmented using DTI-maximum a posteriori (DTI-MAP) classification. The resulting CST volumes were then divided by total supratentorial white matter volume, resulting in a marker called "normalized streamline volume ratio (NSVR)" to quantify the degree of axonal loss in separate CST pathways associated with leg and hand motor functions. A receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to measure the accuracy of this marker to identify extremities with motor weakness.; Results: NSVR values of handleg CST selectively achieved the following values of accuracysensitivity specificity: 0.840.840.57, 0.820.810.55,0.780.75055, 0.790.810.54 at a cut-off of 0.030.030.030.02 for right hand CST, left hand CST, right leg CST, and left leg CST, respectively. Motor weakness of hand and leg was most likely present at the cut-off values of hand and leg NSVR (Le., 0.0290.0280.0250.020 for left-handright-handleft-legright-leg). The control group showed a moderate age-related increase in absolute CST volumes and a biphasic age-related variation of the normalized CST volumes, which were lacking in the paretic children.; Conclusions: This study demonstrates that DTI-MAP classification may provide a new imaging tool to quantify axonal loss in children with central motor dysfunction. Using this technique, we found that early-life brain lesions affect the maturational trajectory of the primary motor pathway which may be used as an effective marker to facilitate evidence-based treatment of paretic children.

N2  -  Functional cortical changes have been demonstrated in patients with several neurological conditions, including stroke, tumors and MS. The correlation found between the extent of fMRI activations and the extent and severity of brain structural damage suggests an adaptive role of these functional changes. In this study, we assess, using fMRI, the brain pattern of movement-associated cortical activations in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) patients and investigate whether the extent of cortical reorganization is associated with the extent of brain pathology, measured on dual-echo and diffusion tensor (DT) MR images.
From 14 right-handed NPSLE patients and 14 matched controls, we obtained: (a) fMRI during the performance of repetitive flexion-extension of the last four fingers of the right hand; (b) dual-echo and (c) pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar sequence to calculate DT MRI maps of the normal-appearing white (NAWM) and gray (NAGM) matter.; Brain T2-visible abnormalities were detected in I I NPSLE patients. Compared with controls, NPSLE patients had significantly higher NAWM fractional anisotropy histogram peak height (P = 0.005), and more significant activations of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, putamen and dentate nucleus. They also had more significant activations of several regions located in the frontal and parietal lobes as well as of MTV5 and the middle occipital gyrus, bilaterally. Strong correlations (r values ranging from 0.79 to 0.87) were found between relative activations of sensorimotor areas and the extent and severity of brain damage.; Movement-associated functional cortical changes do occur in patients with NPSLE and might contribute to the maintenance of their normal functional capacities.

N2  -  Current optimal MRI identifies a relevant structural abnormality in up to 80% of patients with refractory partial seizures, Identification of a structural lesion is fundamental to pre-surgical evaluation, We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to examine objectively the diffusion properties, and hence structural organization, of cerebral tissue in 10 patients with partial seizures and acquired lesions and 30 patients with partial seizures and normal MRI, Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were calculated and, using SPR I, individual patients were compared with a group of 30 control subjects, Diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-by-voxel statistical comparisons identified significant increases in diffusivity and significant reductions of anisotropy in all patients with acquired nonprogressive cerebral lesions and partial seizures, In all of these patients, the areas of increased diffusivity, and in nine patients the areas of decreased anisotropy, concurred with abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI, In addition, there were 10 areas which were normal on conventional imaging which exhibited abnormal anisotropy or diffusivity, Individual analyses of the 30 patients with partial seizures and normal optimal MRI identified a significant increase in diffusivity in eight of the subjects, In six of these, the areas of increased diffusivity concurred with the localization of epileptiform EEG abnormality, Analysis of anisotropy in the MRI-negative patients revealed significant differences in two patients, one of which concurred with electroclinical seizure localization, Group analysis of nine patients with normal conventional MRI and electroclinical seizure onset localizing to the left temporal region revealed a significant increase in diffusivity and a significant reduction in anisotropy within the white matter of the left temporal lobe, DTI analysed using SPM was sensitive in patients with acquired cerebral damage, Significant differences in the diffusion indices in individual MRI negative patients and the group effect in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy suggest that minor structural disorganization exists in occult epileptogenic cerebral lesions, These techniques are promising, non-invasive imaging methods for identifying the cause of partial seizures, and can contribute to pre-surgical evaluation.

N2  -  Objectives: The present study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of gadolinium-diethylene-trianminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) significantly affects diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of focal liver lesions (FLLs). Methods: A total of 26 patients with 26 FLLs, including 6 hemangioma and 20 hepatocellular carcinoma, underwent DWI with b value of 600 s/mm(2) before and after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of FLLs were calculated on DWI. ADC values of FLLs were measured on ADC maps. The statistical significance of differences between precontrast and postcontrast data was determined using paired t-test. Results: On DWI, the SNR and CNR of FLLs on postcontrast DWI were significantly higher than those on precontrast DWI (P=0.036 and P=0.008, respectively). ADC values of the lesions were significantly lower on postcontrast DWI than on precontrast DWI (P=0.019). Conclusions: The SNR and CNR of FLLs on DWI were significantly increased after Gd-DTPA injection. However, ADC values of FLLs were significantly decreased after Gd-DTPA injection. If ADC measurements are taken into account, DWI should be performed before Gd-DTPA injection.

N2  -  Objective: We employed non-invasive pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) in infarcted and nearby neural regions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic lacunar stroke (CLS). The results were compared with CBF in healthy individuals.
Methods: AIS and CLS patients were imaged with ASL, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and conventional MRI. CBF maps were created with 3DASL software. Two expert readers identified AIS and CLS lesions on conventional images, DWI images and CBF maps. A senior radiologist calculated CBF values for lesions and nearby regions. Lesion, nearby regions and normal corresponding region values were analyzed using a two-sample t-test.; Results: Fifty-six stroke patients (21 with AIS and 35 with CLS) and 30 healthy subjects participated in this study. In the AIS group, AIS lesions appeared in the cortexwhite matter, externalinternal capsule (ECIC), and basal ganglia. AIS lesions had lower CBF values than the normal corresponding regions (p < 0.05). The mean CBF values in AIS nearby regions were significantly higher than those in normal corresponding regions (p < 0.05). In the CLS group, the CBF values in white matter and ECIC were lower than the CBF values in normal corresponding regions (p = 0.063 and 0.052, respectively). The CBF values in CLS nearby regions and normal corresponding regions were not significantly different (p > 0.05).; Conclusion: In some regions of the brain, CLS lesions, AIS lesions, and their nearby regions have different perfusion statuses. In particular, the AIS nearby regions perfusion in our subjects was significantly higher than that previously reported. pCASL can be a robust imaging technique for diagnosing strokes in clinical practices.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To examine possible differences between the evolution of cerebral watershed infarction (WI) and that of territorial thromboembolic infarction (TI) by using diffusion-weighted (DW) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with Tl and nine with Wl underwent MR imaging from the acute to chronic infarction stages. ADC maps were derived from DW images. Lesion-to-normal tissue signal intensity ratios on ADC maps (rADC), echo-planar T2-weighted images, and DW images were calculated. Lesion volumes at acute or early subacute infarction stages were measured on-DW, images, and final lesion volumes were estimated on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images,; RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in temporal evolution patterns of rADC between Wl and TI (P <.001). rADC pseudonormalization following Tl began about 10 days after symptom onset, but that following Wl did not occur until about 1 month after symptom onset. The Pearson correlation coefficient between final and initial infarct volumes was 0.9899 for both infarction subtypes, indicating that the initial ischemic injury volume measured at the acute or early subacute stage predicted the final lesion volume fairly well.; CONCLUSION: The evolution time of ADC is faster for TI than for WI. This difference, which likely originates from the different pathophysiologic and hemodynamic features of the two infarction types, might account for the relatively large range of ADC values reported for the time course of ischemic strokes.

N2  -  Atypical brain development and early brain injury have profound and long lasting impact on the development, skill acquisition, and subsequent independence of a child. Heterogeneity is present at the brain level and at the motor level; particularly with respect to phenomena of bilateral activation and mirrored movements (MMs). In this multiple case study we consider the feasibility of using several modalities to explore the relationship between brain structure and/or activity and hand function: Electroencephalography (EEG), both structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Electromyography (EMG) and hand function assessments.
Methods: 15 children with unilateral CP (ages: 9.4 2.5 years) undertook hand function assessments and at least two additional neuroimaging andor neurophysiological procedures: MRIDTIfMRI (n = 13), TMS (n = 11), andor EEGEMG (n = 8). During the fMRI scans and EEG measurements, a motor task was performed to study cortical motor control activity during simple hand movements. DTI tractography analysis was used to study the corpus-callosum (CC) and cortico-spinal tracts (CST). TMS was used to study cortico-spinal connectivity pattern.; Results: Type and range of severity of brain injury was evident across all levels of manual ability with the highest radiological scores corresponded to children poorer manual ability. Evidence of MMs was found in 7 children, mostly detected when moving the affected hand, and not necessarily corresponding to bilateral brain activation. When moving the affected hand, bilateral brain activation was seen in 611 children while 311 demonstrated unilateral activation in the contralateral hemisphere, and one child demonstrated motor activation predominantly in the supplementary motor area (SMA). TMS revealed three types of connectivity patterns from the cortex to the affected hand: a contralateral (n = 3), an ipsilateral (n = 4) and a mixed (n = 1) connectivity pattern; again without clear association with MMs. No differences were found between children with and without MMs in lesion scores, motor fMRI laterality indices, CST diffusivity values, and upper limb function. In the genu, midbody, and splenium of the CC, higher fractional anisotropy values were found in children with MMs compared to children without MMs. The EEG data indicated a stronger mu-restoration above the contralateral hemisphere in 68 children and above the ipsilateral hemisphere in 28 children.; Conclusion: The current results demonstrate benefits from the use of different modalities when studying upper-limb function in children with CP; not least to accommodate to the variations in tolerance and feasibility of implementation of the differing methods. These exposed multiple individual brain-reorganization patterns corresponding to different functional motor abilities. Additional research is warranted to understand the transactional influences of early brain injury, neuroplasticity and developmental and environmental factors on hand function in order to develop targeted interventions.

N2  -  FUNCTIONAL BRAIN MAPPING may be useful for both preoperative planning and intraoperative neurosurgical decision making. "Gold standard" functional studies such as direct electrical stimulation and recording are complemented by newer, less invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. Less invasive techniques allow more areas of the brain to be mapped in more subjects (including healthy subjects) more often (including pre- and postoperatively). Expansion of the armamentarium of tools allows convergent evidence from multiple brain mapping techniques to bear on pre- and intraoperative decision making. Functional imaging techniques are used to map motor, sensory, language, and memory areas in neurosurgical patients with conditions as diverse as brain tumors, vascular lesions, and epilepsy. In the future, coregistration of high resolution anatomic and physiological data from multiple complementary sources will be used to plan more neurosurgical procedures, including minimally invasive procedures. Along the way, new insights on fundamental processes such as the biology of tumors and brain plasticity are likely to be revealed.

N2  -  Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been successfully applied to study changes in deep grey matter nuclei as well as in lesional tissue, but its application to white matter has been complicated by the observed orientation dependence of gradient echo signal. The anisotropic susceptibility tensor is thought to be at the origin of this orientation dependence, and magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (MSA) derived from this tensor has been proposed as a marker of the state and integrity of the myelin sheath and may therefore be of particular interest for the study of demyelinating pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Reconstruction of the susceptibility tensor, however, requires repeated measurements with multiple head orientations, rendering the approach impractical for clinical applications.In this study, we combined single-orientation QSM with fibre orientation information to assess apparent MSA in three white matter tracts, i.e., optic radiation (OR), splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), and superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), in two cohorts of 64 healthy controls and 89 MS patients. The apparent MSA showed a significant decrease in optic radiation in the MS cohort compared with healthy controls. It decreased in the MS cohort with increasing lesion load in OR and with disease duration in the splenium. All of this suggests demyelination in normal appearing white matter. However, the apparent MSA observed in the SLF pointed to potential systematic issues that require further exploration to realize the full potential of the presented approach. Despite the limitations of such single-orientation ROI-specific estimation, we believe that our clinically feasible approach to study degenerative changes in WM is worthy of further investigation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most response criteria for patients with glioblastoma rely on increases in the contrast enhancing abnormality to determine tumor progression. Our aim was to determine retrospectively in patients with glioblastoma whether diffusion restriction can predict the development of new enhancing mass lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the brain MR imaging scans (including DWI and ADC maps) of 208 patients with glioblastoma. Patients with restricted diffusion in or adjacent to the tumor were identified, with further analysis only performed on those patients with low-ADC lesions without enhancement. These patients were followed to determine if new concordant enhancement developed at the site of the low-ADC lesion. A Wilcoxon signed rank test, competing risk analysis, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the mean drop in ADC values, assess enhancement-free survival, and determine overall survival, respectively.; RESULTS: In 67 of the 208 patients (32.2%), visibly detectable restricted diffusion was seen during treatment. The study cohort was formed by the 27 patients with low-ADC lesions and no corresponding enhancement. Twenty-three (85.2%) patients developed gadolinium-enhancing tumor at the site of restricted diffusion a median of 3.0 months later (95% CI, 2.6-4.1 months). The mean decrease in ADC was 22.9% from baseline (P < .001). The 3-month enhancement-free survival probability was 0.481 (95% CI, 0.288-0.675). The 12-month overall survival probability was 0.521 (95% CI, 0.345-0.788). Restricted diffusion predicted enhancement regardless of antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab.; CONCLUSIONS: In a subset of patients with glioblastoma, development of a new focus of restricted diffusion during treatment may precede the development of new enhancing tumor.

N2  -  Purpose: To develop a statistical method of combining multimodal MRI (mMRI) of adult glial brain tumours to generate tissue heterogeneity maps that indicate tumour grade and infiltration margins.
Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of mMRI from patients with histological diagnosis of glioma (n = 25). H-1 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) was used to label regions of "pure" low-or high-grade tumour across image types. Normal brain and oedema characteristics were defined from healthy controls (n = 10) and brain metastasis patients (n = 10) respectively. Probability density distributions (PDD) for each tissue type were extracted from intensity normalised proton density and T-2-weighted images, and p and q diffusion maps. Superpixel segmentation and Bayesian inference was used to produce whole-brain tissue-type maps.; Results: Total lesion volumes derived automatically from tissue-type maps correlated with those from manual delineation (p < 0.001, r = 0.87). Large high-grade volumes were determined in all grade III & IV (n = 16) tumours, in grade II gemistocytic rich astrocytomas (n = 3) and one astrocytoma with a histological diagnosis of grade II. For patients with known outcome (n = 20), patients with survival time < 2 years (3 grade II, 2 grade III and 10 grade IV) had a high-grade volume significantly greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed rank p < 0.0001) and also significantly greater high grade volume than the 5 grade II patients with survival > 2 years (Mann Witney p = 0.0001). Regions classified from mMRI as oedema had non-tumour-like H-1 MRS characteristics.; Conclusions: H-1 MRSI can label tumour tissue types to enable development of a mMRI tissue type mapping algorithm, with potential to aid management of patients with glial tumours.

N2  -  Severe internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion is considered to be one of the important causes of stroke. The authors created a complete unilateral carotid artery occlusion model ill 15 Sprague-Dawley rats, induced severe hypotension for at least 36 minutes by exsanguination with the target mean arterial pressure being equal or less than 35 mmHg, and investigated the temporal and spatial evolution of cerebral ischemia by diffusion-, T2-, and postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Cerebral ischemia was detected in most regions of the right middle cerebral artery territory during exsanguination. There was no significant relationship between ischemic lesion volume detected oil apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (ADC lesion volume) and infarction volume found oil histopathology. However, there was a linear relationship between the change in ADC lesion volume at blood reinfusion (after reinfusion minus before reinfusion) and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 0.4X + 161.7, P = 0.0066) and a significant logarithmic correlation between the volume of vasogenic edema found on postcontrast T1-weighted image at I hour of the postreinfusion period and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 62.1 x logX - 115.4, P = 0.022). In conclusion, although it may be difficult to predict the outcome of cerebral ischemia (infarction volume) from the lesion volume during exsanguination, the evolution of cerebral ischemia may be partly predicted by lesion volume changes seen on the ADC maps at the time of the blood reinfusion or by the severity of blood-brain barrier disruption at the early stage of the postreinfusion period.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance imaging to monitor the response of human glioma tumor xenografts to single fraction radiation therapy. Mice were divided into four treatment groups (n=6 per group) that received 50, 200, 400, or 800 cGy of 200 kVp x rays. A fifth group (n=6) received no radiation dose and served as the control. Quantitative maps of the treated tumor tissue were produced of water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transverse relaxation time (T2). Mice were imaged before and at multiple time points after treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in tumor growth relative to that of the control for all treatment groups. Only the highest dose group showed T2 values that were significantly different at all measured time points after treatment. In this group, there was an 8.3% increase in T2 relative to controls 2 days after treatment, but when measured 14 days after treatment, mean tumor T2 had dropped to 10.1% below the initial value. ADC showed statistically significant differences from the control at all dose points. A radiation dose dependence was observed. In the highest dose group, the fractional increases in ADC were higher than those observed for T2. ADC was sensitive to radiation-induced changes in lower dose groups that did not have significant T2 change. At all doses, elevation of mean tumor ADC preceded deviations in tumor growth from the control. These observations support the potential application of ADC as a time and dose sensitive marker of tumor response to radiation therapy.

N2  -  The well-vascularized nature of gliomas has generated a lot of interest in antiangiogenic therapies. However, the potential of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) against gliomas has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we examined the in vivo efficacy of the tumor-VDA 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) against gliomas. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI were used to characterize the vascular and cellular responses of GL261 and U87 gliomas to DMXAA treatment. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Before VDA treatment, minimal enhancement was detected within the tumor in both models. Longitudinal relaxation rate (R(1)=1/T(1)) maps acquired 24 h after treatment showed marked extravasation and accumulation of the contrast agent in the tumor indicative of treatment-induced vascular disruption. Normalized change in relaxation rate (Delta R(1)) values of the tumor showed a significant increase (P < 0.01 GL261; P < 0.05 U87) after therapy compared with baseline estimates. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were significantly increased (P = 0.015) 72 h after therapy in GL261 but not in U87 gliomas. Vascular disrupting agent therapy resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) increase in median survival in both models evaluated. The results highlight the potential of VDAs against gliomas and the utility of MRI in the assessment of glioma response to VDA therapy.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography reconstruction of white matter pathways can help guide brain tumor resection. However, DTI tracts are complex mathematical objects and the validity of tractography-derived information in clinical settings has yet to be fully established. To address this issue, we initiated the DTI Challenge, an international working group of clinicians and scientists whose goal was to provide standardized evaluation of tractography methods for neurosurgery. The purpose of this empirical study was to evaluate different tractography techniques in the first DTI Challenge workshop.
METHODSEight international teams from leading institutions reconstructed the pyramidal tract in four neurosurgical cases presenting with a glioma near the motor cortex. Tractography methods included deterministic, probabilistic, filtered, and global approaches. Standardized evaluation of the tracts consisted in the qualitative review of the pyramidal pathways by a panel of neurosurgeons and DTI experts and the quantitative evaluation of the degree of agreement among methods.; RESULTSThe evaluation of tractography reconstructions showed a great interalgorithm variability. Although most methods found projections of the pyramidal tract from the medial portion of the motor strip, only a few algorithms could trace the lateral projections from the hand, face, and tongue area. In addition, the structure of disagreement among methods was similar across hemispheres despite the anatomical distortions caused by pathological tissues.; CONCLUSIONSThe DTI Challenge provides a benchmark for the standardized evaluation of tractography methods on neurosurgical data. This study suggests that there are still limitations to the clinical use of tractography for neurosurgical decision making.

N2  -  A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-suppressed flow-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) double-shot diffusion echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was developed and used, along with a non-CSF-suppressed version of the sequence, to determine the extent of the contribution of CSF partial-volume averaging to the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of normal human brain in vivo, Regional analysis indicates that cortical gray matter and parenchymal tissues bordering the ventricles are most affected by CSF contamination, leading to elevated ADC values, Only slight differences in gray- and white-matter average ADCs were detected after CSF suppression. The human brain average ADCs calculated from high-resolution CSF-suppressed diffusion-weighted images in these studies are similar to those reported in animals. FLAIR diffusion sequences remove CSF as a source of error in ADC determination and ischemic lesion discrimination in diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and ADC maps.

N2  -  Purpose: We studied the ability of Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), a novel advanced diffusion imaging technique, to estimate levels of cellularity in different glioblastoma regions, evaluated their prognostic value compared with established clinical diffusion metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD).
Methods: Forty-two patients with untreated glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, were examined with an advanced MRI tumor protocol. The region of interest (ROI) was obtained from the contrast-enhancing part of tumor and the peritumoral brain zones and then co-registered with RSI-cellularity index, FA and MD maps. Histogram parameters of diffusion metrics were assessed for all ROI locations and compared to MGMT promoter methylation status and survival. The ability of RSI-cellularity index, FA, and MD to stratify survival and were assessed by Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted for significant clinical predictors.; Results: The highest RSI-cellularity index was measured in contrast-enhancing tumor core with a negative gradient from tumor core to the periphery of peritumoral zone with predictive accuracy 81 % (P < 0.001). Shorter overall survival was significant associated with higher RSI-cellularity index (hazard ratio (HR) 3.6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.5, P = 0.002) with synchronal decrease in MD (HR 0.31, 95 %CI 0.1-0.8, P = 0.008) in the contrast-enhanced tumor core. This association was also consistent for RSI-cellularity index value measured in the peri-enhancing zone (HR 3.6, 95 % CI 1.0-12.3, P = 0.041). No statistically significant differences were noted between RSI-cellularity index, FA, nor MD and MGMT promoter methylation.; Conclusion: RSI-cellularity index may be used as prognostic biomarker to improve risk stratification in patients with glioblastoma.

N2  -  Posterior fossa tumors (PFT) are the most common tumors in children. Differentiation between the various PFT types is critical, as different tumors have diverse treatment approaches. This study proposes the use of fused architecture comprising two neural networks, a pre-trained ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a tabular based network for the classification of PFT. The study included data for 158 MRI scans of 22 healthy controls and 136 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed PFT (63 Pilocytic Astrocytoma, 57 Medulloblastoma and 16 Ependymoma). The input data for classification were from magnetic resonance imaging: post contrast T1-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion Trace images, and tabular data: subject's age. Evaluation of the model was performed in a stratified 5-fold cross-validation manner, based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score metrics. Model explanation was performed in terms of visual explanation of the CNN by Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and by testing the contribution to the classification results of the different imaging input data sets and the proposed fused architectures relative to CNN only and tabular only architectures. The best classification results were obtained with the fused CNN + tabular data architecture, and based on diffusion Trace images, achieving mean cross-validation accuracy of 0.88 +/- 0.04 for the validation and 0.87 +/- 0.02 for the test dataset. Overall, the proposed architecture achieved improvement in accuracy and F1 score compared to CNN method for this dataset.

N2  -  Purpose To investigate whether whole-tumor histogram analyses of diffusivity measurements derived from q-space imaging (QSI) improves the differentiation between meningioma and schwannoma.
Materials and methods Fifteen extra-axial tumors (11 meningiomas and 4 schwannomas) with MR examinations from April 2011 to May 2013 were included. Three-dimensional regions of interest (ROI) encompassed the whole tumor, including cystic areas. Histogram analyses of mean displacement (MD) derived from QSI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for the ROI were performed at mean, the five percentiles of MDn and ADC(n) (n=5, 25, 50, 75, 95th), kurtosis, and skewness. To determine the diagnostic ability of MDn and ADC(n), we also compared the area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.; Results Histogram analyses revealed significant differences between meningioma and schwannoma in MD75, ADC(25), ADC(50), ADC(75), and kurtosis of ADC. The ROC analysis of kurtosis of ADC and MD75 resulted in an AUC of 1.0 and 0.96, respectively. There were no significant differences between the AUC of MD75 and that of kurtosis of ADC (p=0.41).; Conclusion The histogram analyses of MD and ADC derived from QSI were both equally useful in differentiating between intracranial meningioma and schwannoma.

N2  -  To investigate the technical feasibility of whole-body intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging.
Whole-body MR images of eight healthy volunteers were acquired at 3T using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with eight b-values. Coronal parametrical whole-body maps of diffusion (D), pseudodiffusion (D*), and the perfusion fraction (F-p) were calculated. Image quality was rated qualitatively by two independent radiologists, and inter-reader reliability was tested with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed in the brain, liver, kidney, and erector spinae muscle.; Depiction of anatomic structures was rated as good on D maps and good to fair on D* and F-p maps. Exemplary mean D (10(-3) mm(2)s), D* (10(-3) mm(2)s) and F-p (%) values (+- standard deviation) of the renal cortex were as follows: 1.7 +- 0.2; 15.6 +- 6.5; 20.9 +- 4.4. Inter-observer agreement was "substantial" to "almost perfect" (ICC = 0.80 - 0.92). The coefficient of variation of D* was significantly lower with the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional algorithm (p < 0.001), indicating higher stability.; The proposed IVIM protocol allows computation of parametrical maps with good to fair image quality. Potential future clinical applications may include characterization of widespread disease such as metastatic tumours or inflammatory myopathies.; aEuro cent IVIM imaging allows estimation of tissue perfusion based on diffusion-weighted MRI.; aEuro cent In this study, a clinically suitable whole-body IVIM algorithm is presented.; aEuro cent Coronal parametrical whole-body maps showed good depiction of anatomic details.; aEuro cent Potential future applications include detection of widespread metastatic or inflammatory disease.

N2  -  Background Approximately half (55%) of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is known to show abnormal brain images, including high signal intensity in T2 or fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In a minority of anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases, high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been reported, a finding that is highly suggestive of a stroke. Case presentation We present the case of a 66-year-old man who experienced two separate focal seizure events, which involved first the right and then the left upper extremity in a short period of time. The patient showed focal clonic seizures involving right arm and hand, which sometimes evolved to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures on his first admission. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signal intensity on DWI and low signal intensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of the left caudate nucleus and putamen. The patient was discharged symptom-free with anti-epileptic drugs for 2 weeks. The second admission occurred 4 days after the discharge. He exhibited a new symptom of focal clonic seizures involving left arm and hand while showing a brain lesion on the opposite side which is hyperintense on DWI image and hypointense on ADC map. The patient was eventually diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis according to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibody test. Conclusions This is the case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patient whose DWI/ADC images revealed sequential involvement on the left and right basal ganglia with a short time interval. When stroke-like brain lesions on DWI are found in a patient with a focal seizure, a CSF study could help rule out autoimmune encephalitis. We also suggest that DWI/ADC map images may be useful for the early detection of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

N2  -  Glioblastoma is found preferentially in men (1.5/1), nearing age 60, but all ages can be concerned. Clinical symptoms are intracranial mass without specificity, intracranial hypertension and localization signs. From the clinical history, the essential prognosis factors are: age, Karnofsky score and cognitive dysfunction. Conventional MRI sequences, including T1-FSE with and without contrast injection and T2-FSE or Flair-weighted sequences, provide the diagnosis in most cases, showing an intraparenchymal mass with a heterogeneous, irregularly enhanced signal. Other sequences define the tumor more precisely. Diffusion sequences provide the differential diagnosis with an abscess or a highly cellular tumor such as lymphoma. Perfusion sequences allow appreciation of tumor microvascularization outlining the tumor's most active areas. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SRM) sequences allow noninvasive exploration of tumor metabolism. Beyond its diagnostic role, imagery assists the surgical procedure itself, particularly with functional MRI, allowing a precise preoperative mapping of functional cortical areas. Biopsy can also be guided toward the most active areas of the tumor. In the postoperative period, MRI completes the surgeon's impression on whether or not there is residual tumor. Finally, this exam has become essential in follow-up to diagnose recurrence, radionecrosis, or pseudoprogression. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T2  -  PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY

N2  -  MRI is the ideal modality for imaging intracranial tumours. Intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) makes it possible to obtain scans during a neurosurgical operation that can aid complete macroscopic tumour resection-a major prognostic factor in the majority of brain tumours in children. Intraoperative MRI can also help limit damage to normal brain tissue. It therefore has the potential to improve the survival of children with brain tumours and to minimise morbidity, including neurological deficits. The use of ioMRI is also likely to reduce the need for second look surgery, and may reduce the need for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. High-field MRI systems provide better anatomical information and also enable effective utilisation of advanced MRI techniques such as perfusion imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. However, high-field ioMRI facilities require substantial capital investment, and careful planning is required for optimal benefit. Safe ioMRI requires meticulous attention to detail and rigorous application of magnetic field safety precautions. Interpretation of ioMRI can be challenging and requires experience and understanding of artefacts that are common in the intra-operative setting.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively investigate the capabilities of texture analysis (TA) based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of the entire tumor volume and the whole volume of peri-tumoral edema, in discriminating between high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG).
Materials and methods: A total of 33 patients with histopathological proven glioma were prospectively included. There were 20 men and 13 women with a mean age of 54.5 +- 14.7 (standard deviation SD) years (range: 34-75 years). TA parameters of whole tumor and peri-tumoral edema were extracted from the ADC map obtained with diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5-T. TA variables of HGG were compared to those of LGG. The optimum cut-off values of TA variables and their corresponding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for differentiating between LGG and HGG were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.; Results: Mean and median tumoral ADC of HGG were significantly lower than those of LGG, at 1.23 x 10(-3) mm(2)s and 1.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)s cut-off values, yielding 70% sensitivity each (95% CI: 59-82% and 61-80%, respectively), 80% (95% CI: 79-98%) and 90% (95% CI: 82-97%) specificity, and 73% (95% CI: 66-91%) and 76% (95% CI: 72-90%) accuracy, respectively. Significant differences in tumoral and peri-tumoral kurtosis were found between HGG and LGG at 1.60 and 0.314 cut-off values yielding sensitivities of 74% (95% CI: 58-83%) and 70% (95% CI: 59-84%), specificities of 90% (95% CI: 80-95%) and 70% (95% CI: 64-83%) and accuracies of 79% (95% CI: 69-89%) and 70% (95% CI: 64-77%), respectively.; Conclusion: Measurements of whole tumoral and peri-tumoral TA, based on ADC maps, provide useful information that helps distinguish between HGG and LGG.

N2  -  We assessed brain abnormalities in rats exposed prenatally to radiation (X-rays) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological experiments. Pregnant rats were divided into 4 groups: the control group (n = 3) and 3 groups that were exposed to different radiation doses (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 Gy; n = 3 each). Brain abnormalities were assessed in 32 neonatal male rats (8 per group). Ex vivo T-2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed using 11.7-T MRI. The expression of markers of myelin production (Kluver-Barrera staining, KB), nonpyramidal cells (calbindin-D28k staining, CaBP), and pyramidal cells (staining of the nonphosphorylated heavy-chain neurofilament SMI-32) were histologically evaluated. Decreased brain volume, increased ventricle volume, and thinner cortices were observed by MRI in irradiated rats. However, no abnormalities in the cortical 6-layered structure were observed via KB staining in radiation-exposed rats. The DTI color-coded map revealed a dose-dependent reduction in the anisotropic signal (vertical direction), which did not represent reduced numbers of pyramidal cells; rather, it indicated a signal reduction relative to the vertical direction because of low nerve cell density in the entire cortex. We conclude that DTI and histological experiments are useful tools for assessing cortical and hippocampal abnormalities after prenatal exposure to radiation in rats.

N2  -  Purpose We investigated the prognostic significance of tumor-associated white matter (TA-WM) tracts in glioblastoma (GBM) using magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI). We hypothesized that (1) TA-WM tracts harbor microscopic disease not targeted through surgery or radiotherapy (RT), and (2) the greater the extent of TA-WM involvement, the worse the survival outcomes. Methods We studied a retrospective cohort of 76 GBM patients. TA-WM tracts were identified by MR-DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. For each patient, 22 TA-WM tracts were analyzed and each tract was graded 1-3 based on FA. A TA-WM score (TA-WMS) was computed based on number of involved tracts and corresponding FA grade of involvement. Kaplan-Meier statistics were utilized to determine survival outcomes, log-rank test was used to compare survival between groups, and Cox regression was utilized to determine prognostic variables. Results For the MGMT-unmethylated cohort, there was a decrease in OS for increasing TA-WMS (median OS 16.5 months for TA-WMS 0-4; 13.6 months for TA-WMS 5-8; 7.3 months for TA-WMS > 9; p = 0.0002). This trend was not observed in the MGMT-methylated cohort. For MGMT-unmethylated patients with TA-WMS > 6 and involvement of tracts passing through brainstem or contralateral hemisphere, median OS was 8.3 months versus median OS 14.1 months with TA-WMS > 6 but not involving aforementioned critical tracts (p = 0.003 log-rank test). For MGMT-unmethylated patients, TA-WMS was predictive of overall survival in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.27, p = 0.012) while age, gender, and largest tumor dimension were non-significant. Conclusion Increased TA-WMS and involvement of critical tracts are associated with decreased overall survival in MGMT-unmethylated GBM.

T2  -  SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE

N2  -  Anatomic imaging procedures (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) have become essential tools for brain tumor assessment. Functional images (positron emission tomography [PET] and singe-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) can provide additional information useful during the diagnostic workup to determine the degree of malignancy and as a substitute or guide for biopsy. After surgery and/or radiotherapy, nuclear medicine examinations are essential to assess persistence of tumor, to differentiate recurrence from radiation necrosis and gliosis, and to monitor the disease. The combination of functional images with anatomic ones is of the utmost importance for a full evaluation of these patients, which can be obtained by means of imaging fusion. Despite the fast-growing diffusion of PET, in most cases of brain tumors, SPECT studies are adequate and provide results that parallel those obtained with PET. The main limitation of SPECT imaging with brain tumor-seeking radiopharmaceuticals is the lack of precise anatomic details; this drawback is overcome by the fusion with morphological studies that provide an anatomic map to scintigraphic data. In the past, software-based fusion of independently performed SPECT and CT or MRI demonstrated usefulness for brain tumor assessment, but this process is often time consuming and not practical for everyday nuclear medicine studies. The recent development of dual-modality integrated imaging systems, which allow the acquisition of SPECT and CT images in the same scanning session, and their coregistration by means of the hardware, has facilitated this process. In SPECT studies of brain tumors with various radiopharmaceuticals, fused images are helpful in providing the precise localization of neoplastic lesions, and in excluding the disease in sites of physiologic tracer uptake. This information is useful for optimizing diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and radiotherapy treatment planning, with a positive impact on patient management.

Escherichia coli bloodstream infection was associated with brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns in which the lesion distribution was consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Diagnosis of PRES was confirmed by demonstration of vasogenic edema on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and near-complete resolution of clinical manifestations at discharge.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The corpus callosum (CC) has an important role in regulating interhemispheric transfer and is thought to be instrumental in contralateral brain reorganization in patients with brain tumors, as suggested by a previous study reporting callosal differences between language dominance groups through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) characteristics. The purpose of this study was to explore the structural differences in the CC between high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and metastatic tumors (METs) using the DTI characteristics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial diffusivity (AD).
METHODS: HGG (n = 30) and MET (n = 20) subjects with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans including DTI were retrospectively studied. The tumor and CC were segmented using the 3-dimensional T1-weighted scans to determine their volumes. The region of interest (ROI; mean volume of the ROI = 3,090 +- 464 mm(3)) of the body of the CC was overlaid onto the DTI parametric maps to obtain the averaged FA, MD, and AD values.; RESULTS: There were significant differences in the distributions of FA and MD values between the two patient groups (mean FA for HGGMET = .691.646, P < .05; mean MD for HGGMET = .894 x 10(-3) mm(2)second.992 x 10(-3) mm(2)second, P < .01), while there was no correlation between the DTI parameters and the anatomical volumes.; CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is more contralateral brain reorganization in HGG patients than MET patients and that neither the tumor nor callosal volume impact the degree of contralateral brain reorganization.

N2  -  Loss of vision across large parts of the visual field is a common and devastating complication of cerebral strokes. In the clinic, this loss is quantified by measuring the sensitivity threshold across the field of vision using static perimetry. These methods rely on the ability of the patient to report the presence of lights in particular locations. While perimetry provides important information about the intactness of the visual field, the approach has some shortcomings. For example, it cannot distinguish where in the visual pathway the key processing deficit is located. In contrast, brain imaging can provide important information about anatomy, connectivity, and function of the visual pathway following stroke. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and analysis of population receptive fields (pRF) can reveal mismatches between clinical perimetry and maps of cortical areas that still respond to visual stimuli after stroke. Here, we demonstrate how information from different brain imaging modalities-visual field maps derived from fMRI, lesion definitions from anatomical scans, and white matter tracts from diffusion weighted MRI data-provides a more complete picture of vision loss. For any given location in the visual field, the combination of anatomical and functional information can help identify whether vision loss is due to absence of gray matter tissue or likely due to white matter disconnection from other cortical areas. We present a combined imaging acquisition and visual stimulus protocol, together with a description of the analysis methodology, and apply it to datasets from four stroke survivors with homonymous field loss (two with hemianopia, two with quadrantanopia). For researchers trying to understand recovery of vision after stroke and clinicians seeking to stratify patients into different treatment pathways, this approach combines multiple, convergent sources of data to characterize the extent of the stroke damage. We show that such an approach gives a more comprehensive measure of residual visual capacity-in two particular respects: which locations in the visual field should be targeted and what kind of visual attributes are most suited for rehabilitation.

N2  -  Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically dynamic susceptibility MRI (DSC-MRI) is routinely performed as a supplement to conventional MRI in human medicine for patients with intracranial neoplasia and cerebrovascular events. There is minimal data on the use of DSC-MRI in veterinary patients and a DSC-MRI protocol in the veterinary patient has not been described. Sixteen normal dogs, 6 years or older were recruited for this study. The sample population included 11 large dogs (>11 kg) and 5 small dogs (<11 kg). DSC-MRI was performed on a 1.5-T MRI using an adjusted protocol inherent to the MRI. Contrast media was injected using an automatic power injector. Injections were made after five MR measurements were obtained. Following image acquisition, an arterial input function (AIF) graph mapping the transit time of contrast within the cerebral arteries was generated. The manually selected time points along this graph were used to compute perfusion maps. A dose and rate of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-based contrast media at 3 ml/s followed by 10 ml saline flush at 3 ml/s was used in all dogs greater than 11 kg. In all dogs >11 kg, a useable AIF and perfusion map was generated. One dog less than 11 kg received the same contrast dose and rate. In this patient, the protocol did not generate a useable AIF. The remainder of the dogs less than 11 kg followed a protocol of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium-based contrast media at 1.5 ml/s with a 10 ml saline flush at 1.5 ml/s. A useable AIF and perfusion map was generated in the remaining dogs <11 kg using the higher contrast dose and slower rate protocol. This study establishes a contrast dose and administration rate for canine DSC-MRI imaging that is different in dogs greater than 11 kg compared to dogs less than 11 kg. These protocols may be used for future applications to evaluate hemodynamic disturbances in canine intracranial pathology.

N2  -  Studies looking at resection in high-grade gliomas have had mixed results. The authors briefly review the literature regarding the value of the extent of resection. They proceed to the preoperative and intraoperative tools available to the neurosurgeon to distinguish eloquent from noneloquent language cortex and fibers, including the emerging roles of functional magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging tractography and direct cortical/subcortical stimulation in the surgical management of tumors in eloquent areas. Finally, the authors evaluate the postoperative course of these patients and the effect of language deficits on their quality of life.

N2  -  We report on a 32-year-old woman who developed reversible cortical blindness and right-sided weakness after cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation, due to preeclampsia. An initial brain MRI demonstrated high signal intensity lesions in the bilateral occipito-parietal and left frontal lobes on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. All of the lesions showed low signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, which were compatible with cytotoxic edema, and MR angiography (MRA) showed diffuse vasospasm of the intracranial vessels. A follow-up brain MRI showed that most of the lesions disappeared and the vasospasm also resolved. This case suggests that the cytotoxic edema in preeclampsia may evolve differently from the pattern in cerebral infarction and explains the relatively benign course of the neurological signs in preeclampsia.

N2  -  Resection of lesions involving motor or language areas or pathways requires the intraoperative identification of functional cortical and subcortical sites for effectively and safe guidance. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and fiber tractography are MR imaging techniques based on the concept of anisotropic water diffusion in myelinated fibers, which enable 3D reconstruction and visualization of white matter tracts and provide information about the relationship of these tracts to the tumor mass. The authors routinely used DT imaging fiber tractography to reconstruct various tracts involved in the motor and/or language system in a large series of patients with lesions involving the motor and/or language areas or pathways. The DT imaging fiber tractography data were loaded into the neuronavigational system and combined intraoperatively with those obtained from direct electrical stimulation applied at the subcortical level. In this paper the authors report the results of their experience, describing the findings for each tract and discussing technical aspects of the combined use as well as the pitfalls.

N2  -  Background: The localization and organization of language has been an ongoing research interest ever since the early findings of Paul Broca. The emergence of neuroimaging the past 20 years has given us new insights on the anatomical and structural organization of the brain. Lesion studies on patients with aphasia can provide knowledge on where and how specific language functions are organized in the brain.Aims: The primary objective of the study was to investigate the relationships between aphasia severity, aphasic symptoms, lesion location and lesion volume in patients with left hemispheric stroke in the acute phase (within one week post-stroke). Using a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping method (VLSM), we hypothesized that lesions associated with speech comprehension deficits mainly would involve regions within the posterior superior and middle temporal lobe, and lesions associated with speech production deficits would mainly be associated to the inferior frontal areas of the left hemisphere.Methods & procedures: Findings from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) and patients' scores from the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NBAA) were used to investigate our research questions. We did a whole group analysis of descriptive statistics, lesion localization and lesion volume. We thereafter divided the patients into two groups based on their median scores on the NBAA, one high comprehension group and one low comprehension group. We used VLSM to investigate the associations between the patients' lesions and the results from the NBAA.Outcomes & Results:Lesion volume was significantly associated with all subtest from the NBAA. Our initial analysis of the whole group showed that difficulties in naming was associated with lesions within the rolandic operculum. We also found that difficulties in repetition was associated with lesions within the rolandic operculum, and in addition, the superior temporal gyrus. In the group of patients with high comprehension scores lesions within Broca's area, insula, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and Heschl's gyrus were found to be associated with difficulties with overall aphasia severity, repetition, naming, and reading out loud from the NBAA. Conclusions: Lesion volume is strongly associated with aphasia severity in the acute stages of stroke. Further, lesions within Broca's area, the insula, the STG and Heschl's gyrus were found to be crucial areas in language comprehension and production. This confirms current views that speech and language processes depend on the integrity of the entire network comprising both cortical structures and their interconnected fibre tracts.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows neurosurgeons to interactively perform surgery using MRI guidance. High-field strength (1.5-T) imaging permits exceptional observation of intracranial and spinal pathological features. The development of this technology and its application to a variety of neurosurgical procedures are described.
METHODS: We report on the first 101 cases that were treated in the interventional MRI unit (between January 1997 and September 1998). These cases included 39 brain biopsies, 30 tumor resections, 9 functional neurosurgical cases, 8 cyst drainages, 5 laminectomies, and 10 miscellaneous cases. Patients ranged in age from 14 months to 84 years (median, 43 yr); 61 patients were male and 40 were female. Intraoperative functional techniques that were used to influence surgical decision-making included magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, magnetic resonance angiography and venography, chemical shift imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging. All surgery was performed using MRI-compatible instruments within the 5-gauss line and conventional instruments outside that line.; RESULTS: All 39 brain biopsies yielded diagnostic tissue. Of the 30 tumor resections, 24 (80%) were considered radiographically complete. The incidence of serious complications was low and was comparable to that associated with conventional operating rooms. One patient developed a Propionibacterium acnes brain abscess 6 weeks after surgery and another patient experienced Staphylococcus aureus scalp cellulitis after a brain biopsy, yielding an infection rate of less than 2%. No clinically significant hemorrhage was observed in immediate postoperative imaging scans, although one patient developed a delayed hematoma after a thalamotomy. One patient experienced a stroke after resection of a hippocampal tumor. No untoward events were associated with MRI-compatible instrumentation or intraoperative patient monitoring.; CONCLUSION: High-field (1.5-T) interventional MRI is a safe and effective technology for assisting neurosurgeons in achieving the goals of surgery. Preliminary results suggest that the functional capabilities of this technology can yield data that can significantly influence intraoperative neurosurgical decision-making. The rates of serious complications, such as infection, associated with this new technology were low.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: We investigated the added value of combining information from direction-encoded color (DEC) maps with high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans (T1-weighted images [T1WIs]) to improve the identification of regions of interest (ROIs) for fiber tracking during preoperative planning for patients with brain tumors.
METHODS: The dataset included 42 patients with gli-omas and 10 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project. For identification of the ROIs, we combined the structural information from high-resolution T1WIs and the directional information from DEC maps. To test our hypothesis, we examined the interrater and intrarater agreement.; RESULTS: We identified specific ROIs to extract the main white matter bundles. The directional information from the DEC maps combined with the T1WIs (T1WI-DEC maps) had significantly facilitated ROI identification in patients with brain tumors, especially patients in whom the tracts had been displaced by the mass effect of the tumor. Fiber tracking using the combined T1WI-DEC maps showed significantly greater interand intrarater agreement compared with using either T1WI or DEC maps alone.; CONCLUSION: Combining the information from diffusion-derived color-encoded maps with high-resolution anatomical details from structural imaging (T1WI-DEC map), especially in patients with brain tumors, could be useful for accurate identification of the ROIs.

N2  -  Final infarct volume in stroke trials is assessed on images obtained between 30 and 90 days after stroke onset. Imaging at such delayed timepoints is problematic because patients may be lost to follow-up or die before the scan. Obtaining an early assessment of infarct volume on subacute scans avoids these limitations; however, it overestimates true infarct volume because of edema. The aim of this study was to develop a novel approach to quantify edema so that final infarct volumes can be approximated on subacute scans. We analyzed data from 20 stroke patients (median age, 75 years) who had baseline, subacute (fu5d) and late (fu90d) MRI scans. Edema displaces CSF from sulci and ventricles; therefore, edema volume was estimated as change in CSF volume between baseline and spatially coregistered fu5d ADC maps. The median (interquartile range, IQR) estimated edema volume was 13.3 (7.5-37.7) mL. The fu5d lesion volumes correlated well with fu90d infarct volumes with slope: 1.24. With edema correction, fu5d infarct volumes are in close agreement, slope: 0.97 and strongly correlated with actual fu90d volumes. The median (IQR) difference between actual and predicted infarct volumes was 0.1 (-3.0-5.7) mL. In summary, this novel technique for estimation of edema allows final infarct volume to be predicted from subacute MRI.

N2  -  Patients with stroke offer a unique window into understanding human brain function. Mapping stroke lesions poses several challenges due to the complexity of the lesion anatomy and the mechanisms causing local and remote disruption on brain networks. In this prospective longitudinal study, we compare standard and advanced approaches to white matter lesion mapping applied to acute stroke patients with aphasia. Eighteen patients with acute left hemisphere stroke were recruited and scanned within two weeks from symptom onset. Aphasia assessment was performed at baseline and six-month follow-up. Structural and diffusion MRI contrasts indicated an area of maximum overlap in the anterior external/extreme capsule with diffusion images showing a larger overlap extending into posterior perisylvian regions. Anatomical predictors of recovery included damage to ipsilesional tracts (as shown by both structural and diffusion images) and contralesional tracts (as shown by diffusion images only). These findings indicate converging results from structural and diffusion lesion mapping methods but also clear differences between the two approaches in their ability to identify predictors of recovery outside the lesioned regions.

N2  -  Objective: The most frequent intracranial appearance in children with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is represented by the presence of hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images, the so-called "unidentified bright objects" (UBOs). Di Paolo demonstrated that these lesions represent foci of myelin vacuolization with increased water content. The aim of this study was to investigate the isotropic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values within the UBOs and normal-appearing brain and at the regressed UBO sites.
Methods: Fifteen consecutive children with NF1 underwent magnetic resonance diffusion evaluation of the brain. Fifteen healthy age- and sex-matched children constituted the control group. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were obtained, and regions of interest were placed bilaterally in 8 different areas. Two cortical areas were evaluated using single-pixel analysis. Apparent diffusion coefficient values within the UBOs were calculated by using irregular regions of interest. Regressed UBO sites were investigated by using circular regions of interest. Apparent diffusion coefficient values within the different areas were compared using a t test.; Results: Compared with the controls, NF1 patients showed higher ADC values (P < 0.001) in all locations. In the NF1 group, the mean ADC value in the UBOs was higher than in other locations (P < 0.001). The mean ADC value within the regressed UBO sites was higher than in the normal-appearing locations (P < 0.001).; Conclusions: The higher ADC values in children with NF1 suggest an increase in water content of the normal-appearing brain. The UBOs are the areas with the highest water content. The regressed UBOs sites show higher water content than the normal-appearing areas.

N2  -  Objective: Ischemic lesions seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are reversible if reperfusion is performed within minutes after the onset of ischemia. This study was designed to determine whether acute reversibility of DWI abnormalities is transient following brief temporary focal brain ischemia and to characterize the temporal evolution of in vivo ischemic lesions. Met hods: Eight rats were subjected to 30 minutes of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion and underwent diffusion-, perfusion-, and T2-weighted MRI during occlusion; immediately after reperfusion; 30, 60, and 90 minutes after reperfusion; and 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after reperfusion. Average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(av)) values and the cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) ratio were calculated in both the lateral caudoputamen and overlying cortex at each time point. The size of the in vivo ischemic abnormalities was calculated from the ADC(av) and the T2 maps. Postmortem triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to verify ischemic injury. Results: Both the CBFi ratio and ADC(av) values declined significantly in the two regions during occlusion. The CBFi ratio recovered immediately after reperfusion and remained unchanged over 72 hours. However, ADC(av) values returned to normal at 60 to 90 minutes and secondarily decreased at 12 hours after reperfusion as compared with those in the contralateral hemisphere. The extent of the in vivo ischemic lesions maximized at 48 hours and was highly correlated with TTC-derived lesion size. Conclusions: Acute recovery of initial ADC(av)-defined lesions after reperfusion is transient, and secondary ADC(av)-defined lesions develop in a slow and delayed fashion.

N2  -  Background: New imaging techniques allow a detailed visualization of the brain and the findings possibly correlate with neurophysiologic measurements and neurosensory and motor outcomes. Postnatal clinical factors known to associate with neurologic disabilities may contribute to brain abnormalities not visible to the naked eye. Objectives: We evaluated whether quantitative measurement of organized water diffusion on MR imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), relates to neurophysiologic function and to clinical risk factors and motor outcome in preterm infants. Methods: Diffusion-weighted imaging was successfully performed at term age on 30 infants born ! 32 weeks of gestation, birth weight <1,000 g. Infants with major destructive brain lesions were excluded from the final analysis (n = 2). ADC was calculated within regions of interest placed in pons and in white matter regions known to contain motor fibers. Brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) were registered at term age. Gross motor outcome was assessed using Griffiths Scales at 2 years of corrected age. Results: A positive correlation was found between ADC in the pons and the latency of wave III in BAEP (r = 0.619, p = 0.024). Need for inotrope support during the postnatal period and bronchopulmonary dysplasia associated with high ADC values in the pons and in the corona radiata. Infants with poor gross motor outcome had higher ADC in the corona radiata than infants with better outcome (mean = 1.343 vs. 1.197, p = 0.004). Conclusions: This is the first study to report a relationship between ADC and BAEP measurements in the pons. The study may add to the current knowledge about the relation between postnatal clinical factors and diffusion-weighted imaging when evaluating the high-risk infants. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Besides classic criteria, cerebral perfusion imaging could improve patient selection for thrombolytic therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare quantitative perfusion CT imaging and qualitative diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI and PWI) in acute stroke patients at the time of their emergency evaluation.
Methods-Thirteen acute stroke patients underwent perfusion CT and DWI or PWI on admission. The size of infarct and ischemic lesion (infarct plus penumbra) on the admission perfusion CT was compared with that of the MR abnormalities as shown on the DWI trace and on the relative cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, time to peak, and mean transit time maps calculated from PWI studies.; Results-The most significant correlation was found between infarct size on the admission perfusion CT and abnormality size on the admission DWI map (r=0.968, P<0.001). A significant correlation was also observed between the size of the ischemic lesion (infarct plus penumbra) on the admission perfusion CT and the abnormality size on the mean transit time map calculated from admission PWI (r=0.946, P<0.001). Information about cerebral infarct and total ischemia (infarct plus penumbra) carried by both imaging techniques was similar, with slopes of 0.913 and 0.905, respectively.; Conclusions-An imaging technique may be helpful in the identification of cerebral penumbra in acute stroke patients and thus in the selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy. Perfusion CT and DWIPWI are equivalent in this task.

N2  -  AIM: To determine what disease entities show accentuated grey white differentiation of the cerebral hemisphere on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and whether there is a correlation between the different patterns and the cause of the brain injury.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The DWI and ADC maps of 19 patients with global brain injury were reviewed and evaluated to investigate whether there was a correlation between the different patterns seen on the DWI and ADC maps and the cause of global brain injury. The ADC values were measured for quantitative analysis.; RESULTS: There were three different patterns of ADC decrease: a predominant ADC decrease in only the cerebral cortex (n = 8; pattern I); an ADC decrease in both the cerebral cortex and white matter (WM) and a predominant decrease in the WM (n = 9; pattern II); and a predominant ADC decrease in only the WM (n = 3; pattern III).; CONCLUSION: Pattern I is cerebral cortical injury, suggesting cortical laminar necrosis in hypoxic brain injury. Pattern II is cerebral cortical and WM injury, frequently seen in brain death, while pattern 3 is mainly WM injury, especially found in hypoglycaemic brain injury. It is likely that pattern I is decorticate injury and pattern II is decerebrate injury in hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Patterns I and II are found in severe hypoxic brain injury, and pattern II is frequently shown in brain death, whereas pattern III was found in severe hypoglycaemic injury.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Serial study of such MR parameters as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), ADC with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (ADC(FLAIR)), and T2-weighted imaging may provide information on the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute ischemic stroke. Our goals were to establish the natural evolution of MR signal intensity characteristics of acute ischemic lesions and to assess the potential of using specific MR parameters to estimate lesion age,
METHODS: Five serial echo-planar DWI studies with and without an inversion recovery pulse were performed in 27 patients with acute stroke, The following lesion characteristics were studied: 1) conventional ADC (ADC(CONV)); 2) ADC(FLAIR); 3) DWI Signal intensity (SIDWI); 4) T2-weighted signal intensity (SIT2), and 5) FLAIR signal intensity (SIFLAIR),; RESULTS: The lesion ADC(CONV) gradually increased from low values during the first week to pseudonormal during the second week to supranormal thereafter, The lesion ADCFLAIR showed the same pattern of evolution but with lower absolute values. A low ADC value indicated, with good sensitivity (88%) and specificity (90%), that a lesion was less than 10 days old, All signal intensities remained high throughout follow-up, SIDWI showed no significant change during the first week but decreased thereafter. SIT2 initially increased, decreased slightly during week 2, and again increased after 14 days. SIFLAIR showed the same initial increase as the SIT2 but remained relatively stable thereafter.; CONCLUSION: Our findings further clarify the time course of stroke evolution on MR parameters and indicate that the ADC map may be useful for estimating lesion age, Application of an inversion recovery pulse results in lower, potentially more accurate, absolute ADC values.

N2  -  Gliomas are brain tumors that are treated with surgical resection. Prognosis is influenced by the extent of resection and postoperative neurological status. As consequence, given the extreme interindividual and interhemispheric variability of subcortical white matter (WM) surgical planning requires to be patient's tailored. According to the "connectionist model," there is a huge variability among both cortical areas and subcortical WM in all human beings, and it is known that brain is able to reorganize itself and to adapt to WM lesions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography allows visualization of WM bundles. Nowadays DTI tractography is widely available in the clinical setting for presurgical planning. Arcuate fasciculus (AF) is a long WM bundle that connects the Broca's and Wernicke's regions with a complex anatomical architecture and important role in language functions. Thus, its preservation is important for the postoperative outcome, and DTI tractography is usually performed for planning surgery within the language-dominant hemisphere. High variability among individuals and an asymmetrical pattern has been reported for this WM bundle. However, the functional relevance of AF in the contralateral non-dominant hemisphere in case of tumoral or surgical lesion of the language-dominant AF is unclear. This review focuses on AF anatomy with special attention to its asymmetry in both normal and pathological conditions and how it may be explored with preoperative tools for planning surgery on gliomas in language areas. Based on the findings available in literature, we finally speculate about the potential role of preoperative evaluation of the WM contralateral to the surgical site.

N2  -  In the past decade, the fusion between diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has opened the way for exploring structure-function relationships in vivo. As it stands, the common approach usually consists of analysing fMRI and dMRI datasets separately or using one to inform the other, such as using fMRI activation sites to reconstruct dMRI streamlines that interconnect them. Moreover, given the large inter-individual variability of the healthy human brain, it is possible that valuable information is lost when a fixed set of dMRI/fMRI analysis parameters such as threshold values are assumed constant across subjects. By allowing one to modify such parameters while viewing the results in real-time, one can begin to fully explore the sensitivity of structure-function relations and how they differ across brain areas and individuals. This is especially important when interpreting how structure-function relationships are altered in patients with neurological disorders, such as the presence of a tumor. In this study, we present and validate a novel approach to achieve this: First, we present an interactive method to generate and visualize tractography-driven resting-state functional connectivity, which reduces the bias introduced by seed size, shape and position. Next, we demonstrate that structural and functional reconstruction parameters explain a significant portion of intra- and inter-subject variability. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed approach can be used in a neurosurgical planning context. We believe this approach will promote the exploration of structure-function relationships in a subject-specific aspect and will open new opportunities for connectomics.

N2  -  Aim: To determine the use of high b value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis and assessment of acute febrile encephalopathy/encephalitis in childhood.
Subjects and methods: We enrolled 22 children, for whom we examined DWI with b = 1000 smm(2), DWI with b = 3000 smm(2), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map with h = 1000 during the acute phase of febrile encephalopathyencephalitis. Clinical diagnoses included acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD; n = 6), clinically mild encephalopathyencephalitis with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS; n = 6), and herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE; n = 3), unclassified acute encephalopathyacute encephalitis (n = 2); acute encephalitis with refractory, repetitive partial seizures (AERRPS; = 1); other encephalopathy (n = 1); infarction (n = 1); head injury (n = 1); or mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (n = 1). The diagnostic quality of brain lesions was compared between h = 1000 and b = 3000 DWI images by visual inspection. In addition, we attempted a quantitative assessment using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and an index of signal intensity (SI) ratio, defined as the mean SI at the affected lesion divided by the mean SI at the pons.; Results: High intensity lesions were either visible only on h = 3000 DWI (n = 5; 2 AESD, I MERS, I HSE, and 1 unclassifiable encephalopathy) or more effectively identified on b = 3000 DWI than on b = 1000 DWI (n = 17). The outcome of the former five subjects was favorable, without motor or intellectual sequelae. The mean SI ratio of b = 3000 was significantly greater than that of = 1000 in AESD and MERS subgroups as well as in all 22 subjects. Mean ADC values were lower in the AESD and MERS than that in the HSE subgroups.; Conclusion: We concluded that b = 3000 DWI was superior to b = 1000 DWI in detecting abnormal lesions in acute encephalopathyencephalitis during childhood.

N2  -  Objective Although splenial lesions are rare, they are frequently associated with ischemic infarcts, antiepileptic drug toxicity or abrupt discontinuation, viral encephalitis, and metabolic disturbances. In this study, we evaluated clinical and imaging findings and aetiology in 16 patients with splenium lesions. Methods Between 2013 and 2017, patients with splenium lesions were examined. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 1.5-T unit with fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequences. Additionally, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were examined. Results The patients were 11 males and 5 females; the mean age was 52.3 +/- 20.3 (22-87) years. The patients were admitted with the following conditions: consciousness disorder (n= 7, 43.7%), headache (n= 3, 18.7%), seizure (n= 3, 18.7%), ataxia (n= 3, 18.7%), hemiparesis (n= 4, 25%), meaningless speech (n= 2, 12.5%), fever (n= 3, 18.7%), perioral numbness (n= 1, 6.2%), and diplopia (n= 1, 6.2%). Hyperintensity in the splenium was observed in DWI sequences in all patients on MRI. Fourteen patients (87.5%) showed hypointensity in the same region on ADC. In patients with ischemic infarcts, the splenium lesions were most commonly observed in the area of the posterior cerebral artery (n= 4, 25%). MRI showed splenial signal changes in DWI sequences in all patients. Hyperintensity in the splenium was observed in DWI sequences in all patients on MRI. Fourteen patients (87.5%) showed hypointensity in the same region on ADC. The aetiologies were defined as multiple sclerosis (n= 1, 6.2%), ischemic infarction (n= 4, 25%), tuberculous meningitis (n= 3, 18.7%), viral encephalitis (n= 2, 12.5%), hypernatremia (n= 1, 6.2%), brain tumour (n= 1, 6.2%), Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome (n= 1, 6.2%), head trauma (n= 1, 6.2%), substance use (n= 1, 6.2%), and epilepsy (n= 1, 6.2%). Conclusion Not every diffuse restriction observed on MRI indicates an ischemic stroke. Although radiologic images of the splenium may suggest acute ischemic infarction, the actual cause may be another pathology. Therefore, the symptoms and aetiologies of patients with splenium lesions should be considered and investigated from a wide range of perspectives.

N2  -  Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare immune-mediated complication of a vi-ral infection commonly involving the bilateral thalamus and has been reported mainly in children. Here, we describe the MRI findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-as-sociated ANE in two pediatric patients, including a 7-year-old girl with fever and mental change, and a 6-year-old girl with fever and generalized seizures. Brain MRI revealed sym-metrical T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery high-signal intensity lesions in the bilater-al thalamus with central hemorrhage. In one patient, the thalamic lesions showed a tri-laminar pattern on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. This report emphasizes the importance of creating awareness regarding these findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in children with severe neurological symptoms. Furthermore, it provides a lit-erature review of several documented cases of COVID-19 presenting with bilateral tha-lamic hemorrhagic necrosis, suggesting a diagnosis of ANE.

N2  -  Purpose: The authors investigated whether fatty acid emulsion affects the blood-brain barrier (BBB), whether disrupted BBB is reversible, and whether the fatty acid emulsion technique may be a model for BBB research.
Materials and Methods: The fat emulsion was made with 0.05 mL of oleic acid or linoleic acid and 20 mL of normal saline. The internal carotid artery in 14 cats was infused with oleic acid emulsion (group 1) and with linoleic acid emulsion in 12 cats (group 2). Gd-enhanced T-1-weighted (Gd-T1WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), and additional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained at 1 hour, 1 and 4 days, and 1 week after infusion. MRI findings were evaluated qualitatively. Quantitatively, the signal intensity ratio (SIR) of the lesion to the contralateral hemisphere was measured on Gd-T1WIs. The SIRs were statistically analyzed using the student t test. The brain tissue was removed immediately for light and electron microscopy examination if the lesion showed no contrast enhancement and was isointense on DWIs and the ADC maps.; Results: The lesions appeared at 1 hour in both groups as contrast enhancement on Gd-T1WIs, as isointensity or mild hyperintensity on DWIs, and as isointensity on the ADC maps. On day 1, these MRI findings were decreased in group 1 and were not seen in group 2. At 1 hour, the SIRs of group 1 were significantly higher than those of group 2 (P = 0.016). On day 1, the SIRs of both groups approximated 1.0. Light microscopy findings revealed minor necrosis and demyelination in one cat from group 1 and in 3 cats from group 2. Electron microscopy examinations showed minimal findings in the cortical lesions in groups 1 and 2.; Conclusions: Infusion of unsaturated fatty acid emulsion into the carotid artery of cats revealed vasogenic edema of the brain and reversible changes as depicted on MRI. This unsaturated fat emulsion technique may be used as a model for research on BBB disruption.

N2  -  Object. The goal of this study was to use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to track fibers combined with cortical stimulation mapping to delineate descending motor pathways. Subcortical localization of motor pathways in relation to a glioma may provide critical information to guide tumor resection and prevent surgical morbidity.
Methods. Eleven adult patients harboring gliomas underwent MR imaging 1 day prior to image-guided intraoperative cortical motor mapping and tumor resection. Screens depicting 27 cortical motor sites on a surgical navigation system were saved to launch DT imaging of fiber tracks of descending motor pathways. The position and organization of motor tracts were visualized by fiber tracking. Tracks from 16 motor stimulation sites followed descending pathways from the precentral gyrus, through the corona radiata and internal capsule, and into the cerebral peduncle. These tracks were also observed on DT images to diverge along crossing white matter bundles (four patients) and to terminate or deviate in regions of peritumoral vasogenic edema (five patients).; Conclusions. The use of precise intraoperative cortical mapping information and DT images of fiber tracks can reveal the course of motor pathways beneath the cortex. The subcortical fiber tracks generated are consistent with the known anatomical course and somatotopic organization of the motor tract in relation to its cortical origins. Tracking fibers by using DT imaging in combination with functional localization has the potential to reduce surgical morbidity by revealing subcortical connections of the functional cortex.

N2  -  Background: Cerebral malaria is a major health hazard, with a high incidence of mortality. The disease is endemic in many developing countries, but with a greater increase in tourism, occasional cases may be detected in countries where the disease in not prevalent. Early diagnosis and evaluation of cerebral involvement in malaria utilizing modern imaging modalities have an impact on the treatment and clinical outcome.
Purpose: To evaluate the magnetic resonance (MR) features of patients with cerebral malaria presenting with altered sensorium.; Material and Methods: We present the findings in three patients with cerebral malaria presenting with altered sensorium. MR imaging using a 1.5-Tesla unit was carried out. The sequences performed were 5-mm-thick T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted gradient-echo axial sequences, and sagittal and coronal FLAIR. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with b values of 0 and 1000 smm(2), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained.; Results: Focal hyperintensities in the bilateral periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, occipital subcortex, and bilateral thalami were noticed on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. The lesions were more marked in the splenium of the corpus callosum. No enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted MR images was observed. There was no evidence of restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted sequence and ADC map.; Conclusion: MR is a sensitive imaging modality, with a role in the assessment of cerebral lesions in malaria. Focal white matter and corpus callosal lesions without any restricted diffusion were the key findings in our patients.

N2  -  Quantification of water permeability can improve the accuracy of perfusion measurements obtained with arterial spin labeling (ASL) methods, and may provide clinically relevant information regarding the functional status of the microvasculature. The amount of labeled water in the vascular and tissue compartments in an ASL experiment can be estimated based on their distinct diffusion characteristics, and in turn, water permeability determined from the relative vascular and tissue contributions. In the present study, a hybrid magnetic resonance imaging technique was introduced by marrying a continuous ASL method with a twice-refocused spin-echo diffusion sequence. Series of diffusion-weighted ASL signals were acquired with systematically varied b values. The signals were modeled with fast and slow decaying components that were associated with the vascular and tissue compartments, respectively. The relative amount of labeled water in the tissue compartment increased from 61% to 74% and to 86% when the postlabeling delay time was increased from 0.8 to 1.2 and to 1.5 secs. With a b value of 50 secs/mm(2), the capillary contribution (fast component) of the ASL signal could be effectively minimized. Using the single-pass approximation model, the water permeability of gray matter in the human brain was estimated based on the derived relative water fractions in the tissue and microvasculature. The potential for in vivo magnetic resonance mapping of water permeability was showed using two diffusion weighted ASL measurements with b = 0 and 50 secs/mm(2) in both healthy subjects and a case of brain tumor.

N2  -  Purpose: To review magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and spectroscopy findings in patients with focal cerebral tuberculosis and to assess whether these techniques can adequately characterize focal cerebral tubercular lesions.
Material and Methods: Sixteen patients with single or multiple lesions were evaluated on a 1.5 T MR system. DWI was performed with three V values of 50, 500, and 1000 smm(2) and the apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated. MR spectroscopy was performed using the point-resolved single-voxel technique with 2 echo time values of 135 ms and 270 ins. The signal intensities of the tubercular lesions on diffusion images and the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of their centers, along with MR spectroscopy findings, were analyzed in relation to their T2-weighted MR appearances.; Results: DWI identified 17 of the 20 lesions evaluated. Increased signal intensity was seen in 9 of the 17 lesions. The ADCs of the lesions ranged from 0.406 to 2.64x10(-3) mm(2)s (mean+-SD: 1.038+-0.609 mm(2)s). Most of the lesions with hyperintense centers on T2-weighted images were of increased intensity on diffusion images, while those with hypointense centers on T2-weighted images were of decreased signal intensity on diffusion images. However, no statistical difference in the ADCs was found between lesions with increased and those with decreased signal intensity centers on T2-weighted images. MR spectroscopy revealed a lipid peak at 0.9-1.3 ppm in all of the 14 lesions evaluated. An increase in normalized choline:creatine ratio was found in all the lesions in which the spectra were obtained with the voxel, including a variable portion of the lesion wall.; Conclusion: DWI and MR spectroscopy help in determining the nature of cerebral tubercular lesions; however, since the findings are varied, they do not help in specific characterization.

N2  -  BackgroundUnderstanding the structural connectivity of white matter tracts (WMT) and their related functions is a prerequisite to implementing an "a la carte" "connectomic approach" to glioma surgery. However, accessible resources facilitating such an approach are lacking. Here we present an educational method that is readily accessible, simple, and reproducible that enables the visualization of WMTs on individual patient images via an atlas-based approach.MethodsOur method uses the patient's own magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and consists of three main steps: data conversion, normalization, and visualization; these are accomplished using accessible software packages and WMT atlases. We implement our method on three common cases encountered in glioma surgery: a right supplementary motor area tumor, a left insular tumor, and a left temporal tumor.ResultsUsing patient-specific perioperative MRIs with open-sourced and co-registered atlas-derived WMTs, we highlight the critical subnetworks requiring specific surgical monitoring identified intraoperatively using direct electrostimulation mapping with cognitive monitoring. The aim of this didactic method is to provide the neurosurgical oncology community with an accessible and ready-to-use educational tool, enabling neurosurgeons to improve their knowledge of WMTs and to better learn their oncologic cases, especially in glioma surgery using awake mapping.ConclusionsTaking no more than 3-5 min per patient and irrespective of their resource settings, we believe that this method will enable junior surgeons to develop an intuition, and a robust 3-dimensional imagery of WMT by regularly applying it to their cases both before and after surgery to develop an "a la carte" connectome-based perspective to glioma surgery.

N2  -  MRgFUS has just been made available for the 1.7 million Parkinson's disease patients in China. Despite its noninvasive and rapid therapeutic advantages for involuntary tremor, some concerns have emerged about outcomes variability, non-specificity, and side-effects, as little is known about its impact on the long-term plasticity of brain structure. We sought to dissect the characteristics of long-term changes in brain structure caused by MRgFUS lesion and explored potential biological mechanisms. One-year multimodal imaging follow-ups were conducted for nine tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients undergoing unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy. A structural connectivity map was generated for each patient to analyze dynamic changes in brain structure. The human brain transcriptome was extracted and spatially registered for connectivity vulnerability. Genetic functional enrichment analysis was performed and further clarified using in vivo emission computed tomography data. MRgFUS not only abolished tremors but also significantly disrupted the brain network topology. Network-based statistics identified a U-shape MRgFUS-sensitive subnetwork reflective of hand tremor recovery and surgical process, accompanied by relevant cerebral blood flow and gray matter alteration. Using human brain gene expression data, we observed that dopaminergic signatures were responsible for the preferential vulnerability associated with these architectural alterations. Additional PET/SPECT data not only validated these gene signatures, but also suggested that structural alteration was significantly correlated with D1 and D2 receptors, DAT, and F-DOPA measures. There was a long-term dynamic loop between structural alteration and dopaminergic signature for MRgFUS thalamotomy, which may be closely related to the long-term improvements in clinical tremor.

N2  -  Water exchange through the cell membranes is an important feature of cells and tissues. The rate of exchange is determined by factors such as membrane lipid composition and organization, as well as the type and activity of aquaporins. A method for noninvasively estimating the rate of water exchange would be useful for characterizing pathological conditions, e.g., tumors, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke, expected to be associated with a change of the membrane barrier properties. This study describes the filter exchange imaging method for determining the rate of water exchange between sites having different apparent diffusion coefficients. The method is based on the filter-exchange pulsed gradient spin-echo NMR spectroscopy experiment, which is here modified to be compatible with the constraints of clinical MR scanners. The data is analyzed using a modelfree approach yielding maps of the apparent exchange rate, here being introduced in analogy with the concept of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Proof-of-principle experiments are performed on microimaging and whole-body clinical scanners using yeast suspension phantoms. The limitations and appropriate experimental conditions are examined. The results demonstrate that filter exchange imaging is a fast and reliable method for characterizing exchange, and that it has the potential to become a powerful diagnostic tool.

N2  -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon but important variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and represents up to 6% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Recognition of this entity by radiologist on MRI may avoid unnecessary neurosurgical resection and redirect to biopsy. The pretreatment MRI of patients with biopsy proven PCNSL from the last 5 years at our institution was reviewed. Selected examples were used to construct a pictorial essay to illustrate some of the typical and atypical MR features of PCNSL. MRI of other CNS conditions with imaging similarities to PCNSL was included to demonstrate possible mimics. The typical features of PCNSL lymphoma are intra-axial homogenous single or multiple contrast enhancing lesions, with marked surrounding oedema and restricted diffusion, usually contacting a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surface. Necrosis, peripheral enhancement, haemorrhage or calcification are unusual and other diagnoses should be considered if any of these features are present. Potential mimics include high grade glioma, infarcts, metastatic disease, demyelination, abscess and secondary lymphoma. Careful assessment of the MR features and correlation with the clinical findings should enable the radiologists to raise the possibility of PCNSL and minimise the risk of unnecessary resection.

N2  -  Background: Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ameliorating the neurocognitive and physical deficits that accompany traumatic brain injury would be of substantial benefit, but the mechanisms that underlie them are poorly characterized. This study aimed to use diffusion tensor imaging to relate clinical outcome to the burden of white matter injury.
MethodologyPrincipal Findings: Sixty-eight patients, categorized by the Glasgow Outcome Score, underwent magnetic resonance imaging at a median of 11.8 months (range 6.6 months to 3.7 years) years post injury. Control data were obtained from 36 age-matched healthy volunteers. Mean fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and eigenvalues were obtained for regions of interest commonly affected in traumatic brain injury. In a subset of patients where conventional magnetic resonance imaging was completely normal, diffusion tensor imaging was able to detect clear abnormalities. Significant trends of increasing ADC with worse outcome were noted in all regions of interest. In the white matter regions of interest worse clinical outcome corresponded with significant trends of decreasing fractional anisotropy.; ConclusionsSignificance: This study found that clinical outcome was related to the burden of white matter injury, quantified by diffusivity parameters late after traumatic brain injury. These differences were seen even in patients with the best outcomes and patients in whom conventional magnetic resonance imaging was normal, suggesting that diffusion tensor imaging can detect subtle injury missed by other techniques. An improved in vivo understanding of the pathology of traumatic brain injury, including its distribution and extent, may enhance outcome evaluation and help to provide a mechanistic basis for deficits that remain unexplained by other approaches.

N2  -  Purpose In periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reduction, normally shown as dark stripe in the peritrigonal (PT) white matter, may be incomplete. We assessed the PT dark stripe to differentiate between PVL patients and control subjects.
Patients and Methods We reviewed the magnetic resonance studies of 27 neonates and young children with PVL and 67 control subjects to assess the PT dark stripe on ADC maps. In PVL patients, the assessment was referred to the location of PVL lesion on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. In the controls, the PT region or the location corresponding to FLAIR hyperintensity was evaluated for the dark stripe. We compared the prevalence of the dark stripe on ADC map and the PT FLAIR hyperintensity between the PVL and the control subjects.; Results On ADC map, complete PT dark stripe was present in 67 (100%) of 67 controls but only in 4 (14.8%) of 27 PVL patients (p-value<0.01), with sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 1.0, and accuracy of 0.96. PT FLAIR hyperintensity was present in 44 (65.7%) of 67 controls and in 18 (66.7%) of 27 PVL patients (p=0.920).; Conclusion PVL patients can be differentiated from the control subjects with PT dark stripe on ADC map.

N2  -  Objectives. - Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to molecular motion and has been applied to the diagnosis of stroke. Our intention was to investigate its usefulness in patients with brain tumor and, in particular, in the peritesionat edema.
Methods. - We performed MRI of the brain, including diffusion-weighted imaging and mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in 16 patients with brain tumors (glioblastomas, low-grade gliomas and metastases). ADC values were determined by the use of regions of interest positioned in areas of high signal intensities as seen on T2-weighted images and ADC maps. Measurements were taken in the tumor itself, in the area of perilesional edema and in the healthy contrataterat brain.; Results. - ADC mapping showed higher values of periturnorat edema in patients with gtiobtastoma (1.75 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) and metastatic lesions (1.61 x 10(-3) mm(2)S) compared with those who had low-grade glioma (1.40 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). The higher ADC values in the periturnorat zone were associated with tower ADC values in the tumor itself.; Conclusions. - The higher ADC values in the more malignant tumors probably reflect vasogenic edema, thereby allowing their differentiation from other lesions.

N2  -  Background and Purpose The glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex offers a therapeutic target for acute focal ischemia, potentially devoid of most side effects associated with competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists.
Methods A novel glycine receptor antagonist, ZD9379, was studied in 70 Sprague-Dawley rats using the suture occlusion model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In the first experiment, 20 rats received an initial bolus of vehicle or 10 mgkg ZD9379 (n=10 in each group) 30 minutes after MCAO, followed by a continuous infusion of the same dose per hour for 4 hours. Diffusion-weighted MRI with echo-planar acquisition was used to generate maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water. In a second experiment, 50 rats were assigned to five groups: vehicle and 10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mgkg ZD9379 (n=10 in each group) with the same dosing protocol but no imaging. In both experiments, infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining.; Results In the first experiment, before therapy was begun, there was no significant difference in ADC-derived ischemic lesion volume between the two groups. Over time, the 10-mgkg ZD9379-treated rats had a significant delayed regional recovery of reduced ADC values in the peripheral parietal cortex (P=.0156). Postmortem corrected infarct volume at 24 hours after MCAO was significantly smaller in the group treated with 10 mgkg ZD9379 than in the vehicle group (119.2+-52.2 versus 211.2+-50.0 mm(3) mean+-SD; P=.0008; a reduction of 43.6%). In the second experiment, postmortem corrected infarct volumes in rats receiving 10, 5, and 2.5 mgkg ZD9379 were significantly smaller than in those receiving vehicle, a reduction of 42.6%, 51.4%, and 42.9%, respectively (P=.0001).; Conclusions This study demonstrates that 2.5- to 10-mgkg doses of ZD9379 initiated 30 minutes after MCAO significantly reduced infarct size. Diffusion mapping disclosed a delayed treatment effect of this glycine antagonist in focal ischemia, confirmed by the postmortem study.

N2  -  Assessment of radiation and chemotherapy efficacy for brain cancer patients is traditionally accomplished by measuring changes in tumor size several months after therapy has been administered. The ability to use noninvasive imaging during the early stages of fractionated therapy to determine whether a particular treatment will be effective would provide an opportunity to optimize individual patient management and avoid unnecessary systemic toxicity, expense, and treatment delays. We investigated whether changes in the Brownian motion of water within tumor tissue as quantified by using diffusion MRI could be used as a biomarker for early prediction of treatment response in brain cancer patients. Twenty brain tumor patients were examined by standard and diffusion MRI before initiation of treatment. Additional images were acquired 3 weeks after initiation of chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Images were coregistered to pretreatment scans, and changes in tumor water diffusion values were calculated and displayed as a functional diffusion map (fDM) for correlation with clinical response. Of the 20 patients imaged during the course of therapy, 6 were classified as having a partial response, 6 as stable disease, and 8 as progressive disease. The fDMs were found to predict patient response at 3 weeks from the start of treatment, revealing that early changes in tumor diffusion values could be used as a prognostic indicator of subsequent volumetric tumor response. Overall, fDM analysis provided an early biomarker for predicting treatment response in brain tumor patients.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: To explore the value of texture analysis based on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and the effect of region of interest (ROI) placements in distinguishing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from solitary brain metastasis (sMET).
Materials and Methods: Sixty-two patients with pathologically confirmed GBM (n = 36) and sMET (n = 26) were retrospectively included. All patients underwent diffusion-weighted imaging with b values of 0 and 1000 smm(2), and the ADC maps were generated automatically. ROIs were placed on the largest whole single-slice tumor (ROI1) and the enhanced solid portion (ROI2) of the ADC maps, respectively. The texture feature metrics of the histogram and gray-level co-occurrence matrix were then extracted by using in-house software. The parameters of the texture analysis were compared between GBM and sMET, using the Mann-Whitney U test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the best parameters for distinguishing between GBM from sMET.; Results: Homogeneity and the inverse difference moment (IDM) of GBM were significantly higher than those of sMET in both ROls (ROl1, p = 0.014 for homogeneity and p = 0.048 for IDM; ROI2, p < 0.001 for homogeneity and p = 0.029 for IDM). According to the ROC curve analysis, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of homogeneity in ROI1 (AUC, 0.682, sensitivity, 72.2%, specificity, 61.5%) was significantly lower than that of ROI2 (AUC, 0.886, sensitivity, 83.3%, specificity, 76.9%; p = 0.012), whereas the IDM showed no statistical significance between two ROIs (p > 0.05).; Conclusion: The ADC-based texture analysis can help differentiate GBM from sMET, and the ROI on the solid portion would be recommended to calculate the ADC-based texture metrics.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The common entity cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is associated with the poorly characterized imaging finding of parenchymal abnormalities; diffusion-weighted imaging has offered some insight into these manifestations. We assessed the relationship between the diffusion constant from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) with follow-up imaging findings and clinical outcome.
METHODS: We evaluated the medical records and T2-weighted MR images of 13 patients with CVT complicated by intraparenchymal abnormality. Diffusion-weighted (DW) images and ADC maps were evaluated for increased, decreased, or unchanged signal intensity and were compared with signal intensity of contralateral, normal-appearing brain. In addition, ADCs were obtained in nine pixel regions of interest in abnormal regions in eight of the 13 patients.; RESULTS: Eight patients had superficial CVT, and five had superficial and deep CVT. CVT of deep veins was associated with deep gray nucleus and deep white matter abnormalities, whereas superficial CVT was associated with cortical and subcortical abnormalities. Twenty-four nonhemorrhagic lesions were identified in 10 of 13 patients on the basis of follow-up imaging findings. Four patients without seizures had lesions with decreased diffusion that appeared hyperintense on follow-up T2-weighted images, three patients with seizures had lesions with decreased diffusion that resolved, and seven patients had lesions with increased diffusion that resolved. Three of 10 patients had more than one lesion type. No difference was noted in mean ADCs for lesions with decreased diffusion that resolved compared with lesions with decreased diffusion that persisted.; CONCLUSION: DW imaging in these patients disclosed three lesion types: lesions with elevated diffusion that resolved, consistent with vasogenic edema; lesions with low diffusion that persisted, consistent with cytotoxic edema in patients without seizure activity; and lesions with low diffusion that resolved in patients with seizure activity. This information may be important in prospectively determining severity of irreversible injury and in patient treatment.

N2  -  AIM: To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) maps in the diagnosis of intraparenchymal epidermoid cysts (ECs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six cases of histopathologically proven intraparenchymal ECs were studied. All patients were examined with conventional MR (T1WI, T2WI, contrast-enhanced T1WI) and DWI sequences. Along with the mean ADC values (mADC) of the ECs, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and grey matter (GM) were measured. Qualitative and quantitative assessments, as welt as MRI findings, were retrospectively analysed using a double blind method by three radiologists in consensus.; RESULTS: Four lesions were located in the cerebellum, among them, one was accompanied by an arachnoid cyst; one huge lesion crossed the parenchyma of the frontal and temporal lobes; the other was located in the left temporal lobe. Two lesions had a homogeneous CSF-like intensity on both T1WI and T2WI. The other four were of mixed-intensity on both T1WI and T2WI. All lesions were strikingly hyperintense on DWI, and iso- or slightly hypointense on ADC (relative to the brain). The mADCs of the ECs were significantly higher than that of GM, but significantly lower than that of CSF. Three cases (36) were accurately diagnosed using conventional MR sequences without DWI, but in the remaining three cases, correct diagnosis could only be made with help of DWI.; CONCLUSION: DWI sequences can facilitate the diagnosis of intraparenchymal ECs, thus alerting surgeons of the risk of chemical meningitis at surgery. The MR findings of intraparenchymal ECs are basically as the same as those of extracerebral ECs, but the former is likely to have a mixed signal. The hyperintense signal of ECs on DWI is probably caused by the T2 shine-through effect in tumour tissue. (C) 2008 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All. rights reserved.

N2  -  The aim of this work focuses on the description of the short-term response of a 9L brain tumor model and its vasculature to microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Rat 9L gliosarcomas implanted in nude mice brains were irradiated by MRT 13 days after tumor inoculation using two orthogonal arrays of equally spaced 28 planar microbeams (25 mu m width, 211 mu m spacing and dose 500 Gy). At 1, 7 and 14 days after MRT, apparent diffusion coefficient, blood volume and vessel size index were mapped by MRI. Mean survival time after tumor inoculation increased significantly between MRT-treated and untreated groups ( 23 and 28 days respectively, log-rank test, p < 0.0001). A significant increase of apparent diffusion coefficient was observed 24 h after MRT in irradiated tumors versus non-irradiated ones. In the untreated group, both tumor size and vessel size index increased significantly (from 7.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.2 +/- 4.0 mm(2) and + 23%, respectively) between the 14th and the 21st day after tumor cell inoculation. During the same period, in the MRT-treated group, no difference in tumor size was observed. The vessel size index measured in the MRT-treated group increased significantly (+26%) between 14 and 28 days of tumor growth. We did not observe the significant difference in blood volume between the MRT-treated and untreated groups. MRT slows 9L tumor growth in a mouse brain but MRI results suggest that the increase in survival time after our MRT approach may be rather due to a cytoreduction than to early direct effects of ionizing radiation on tumor vessels. These results suggest that MRT parameters need to be optimized to further damage tumor vessels.

Methods: The study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee. Among the neonates who were examined during the first 8 days after birth with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and eSWAN, 39 neonates with a preceding acute hypoxic sentinel event were divided into two groups: the hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) group and the high-risk group. Twenty-five neonates were normal control subjects. Conventional MRI, DWI, and T-2* and R-2* maps from eSWAN were assessed. T-2* and R-2* values from T-2* and R-2* maps were calculated in predefined regions in the HIE and high-risk groups and then compared with those in control subjects. Results: The neonates in the HIE and high-risk groups showed a high percentage of cerebral oedema and periventricular white-matter (PWM) lesions. Cerebral oedema and haemorrhagic lesions of PWM were more highly visible on the T-2* map compared with conventional MRI: cerebral oedema was illustrated as a high T-2* area and haemorrhagic lesions had a significantly lower T-2* on the T-2* map. Lower R-2* values of lentiform nuclei (LN) and a higher T-2* and lower R-2* of frontal white matter (FWM) were found in neonates in the HIE group relative to those of normal controls. The T-2* value of LN in the high-risk group was higher than that of the normal controls. Conclusions: The T-2* map from eSWAN is useful in detecting cerebral oedema and haemorrhagic lesions of PWM in neonates. The measurement of T-2* and R-2* values is helpful in assessing the LN and FWM damage in neonates following a hypoxic sentinel event.

N2  -  BACKGROUND:Surgical treatment of deep-seated brain lesions is a major challenge for neurosurgeons. Recently, tubular retractors have been used to help neurosurgeons in achieving the targeting and resection of deep lesions.OBJECTIVE:To describe a novel surgical approach based on the combination of tubular retractors and preoperative mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography for the safe resection of deep-seated lesions.METHODS:Ten consecutive patients affected by deep-seated brain lesions close to eloquent motor/language/visual pathways underwent preoperative nTMS mapping of motor/language cortical areas and nTMS-based DTI tractography of adjacent eloquent white matter tracts, including optic radiations. The nTMS-based information was used to plan the optimal surgical trajectory and to guide the insertion of tubular retractors within the brain parenchyma without causing injury to the eloquent cortical and subcortical structures. After surgery, all patients underwent a new nTMS-based DTI tractography of fascicles close to the tumor to verify their structural integrity.RESULTS:Gross total resection was achieved in 8 cases, subtotal resection in 1 case, and a biopsy in 1 case. No new postoperative deficits were observed, except in 1 case where a visual field defect due to injury to the optic radiations occurred. Postoperative nTMS-based DTI tractography showed the integrity of the subcortical fascicles crossed by tubular retractors trajectory in 9 cases.CONCLUSION:The novel strategy combining tubular retractors with functional nTMS-based preoperative mapping enables a safe microsurgical resection of deep-seated lesions through the preservation of eloquent cortical areas and subcortical fascicles, thus reducing the risk of new permanent deficits.

N2  -  Multiparametric MRI is a remarkable imaging method for the assessment of patho-physiological processes. In particular, brain tumor characterization has taken advantage of the development of advanced techniques such as Diffusion- (DWI) and Perfusion- (PWI) Weighted Imaging, but a thorough analysis of meningiomas is still lacking despite the variety of computational methods proposed.
We compute perfusion and diffusion parametric maps relying on a well-defined methodological workflow, investigating possible correlations between pure and diffusion-based perfusion parameters in a cohort of 26 patients before proton therapy. A preliminary investigation of meningioma staging biomarkers based on IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast is also reported. We observed significant differences between the gross target volume and the normal appearing white matter for every investigated parameter, confirming the higher vascularization of the neoplastic tissue. DWI and PWI parameters appeared to be weakly correlated and we found that diffusion parameters the perfusion fraction in particular could be promising biomarkers for tumor staging.

N2  -  Purpose: To extend the ISODATA image segmentation method to characterize tissue damage in stroke, by generating an MRI score for each tissue that corresponds to its histological damage.
Materials and Methods: After preprocessing and segmentation (using ISODATA clustering), the proposed method scores tissue regions between 1 and 100. Score 1 is assigned to normal brain matter (white or gray matter), and score 100 to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Lesion zones are assigned a score based on their relative levels of similarities to normal brain matter and CSF. To evaluate the method, 15 rats were imaged by a 7T MRI system at one of three time points (acute, subacute, chronic) after MCA occlusion. Then they were killed and their brains were sliced and prepared for histological studies. MRI of two or three slices of each rat brain (using two DWI (b = 400, b = 800), one PDWI, one T2WI, and one T1WI) was performed, and an MRI score between 1 and 100 was determined for each region. Segmented regions were mapped onto the histology images and scored on a scale of 1-10 by an experienced pathologist. The MRI scores were validated by comparison with histology scores. To this end, correlation coefficients between the two scores (MRI and histology) were determined.; Results: Experimental results showed excellent correlations between MRI and histology scores at different time points. Depending on the reference tissue (gray matter or white matter) used in the standardization, the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.73 (P < 0.0001) to 0.78 (P < 0.0001) using the entire dataset, including acute, subacute, and chronic time points. This suggests that the proposed multiparametric approach accurately identified and characterized ischemic tissue in a rat model of cerebral ischemia at different stages of stroke evolution.; Conclusion: The proposed approach scores tissue regions and characterizes them using unsupervised clustering and multiparametric image analysis techniques. The method can be used for a variety of applications in the field of computer-aided diagnosis and treatment, including evaluation of response to treatment. For example, volume changes for different zones of the lesion over time (e.g., tissue recovery) can be evaluated.

N2  -  To investigate the changes of the ischemic lesion in rat brain after subventricular zone (SVZ) cell transplantation and the influence of the grafted cells on the appearance of angiogenesis, SVZ cells, superparamagnetically labeled, were intracisternally transplanted into the rat brain 48 h after onset of embolic stroke. A complete set of magnetic resonance (MR) images was acquired for all animals with (n = 8) and without (n = 3) cell grafting at approximately 24 h, 72 h, and weekly for 6 weeks after stroke. Transplanted cells were tracked by high-resolution three-dimensional gradient-echo images and the interaction between the cells and ischemic lesion was detected by ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm) calculated from T-1, T-2 and T-1sat maps. Tissue status from ISODATA was characterized by a specific signature, which represents the deviation from normal tissue in the feature space. Transplanted SVZ cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic side of the rat brain and approached the lesion boundary within 1-week after grafting. Cell treated rats exhibited a significant reduction of average lesion size compared with control rats ( P < 0.05). A significant reduction of tissue signature (P < 0.001) induced by cell transplantation was localized to the position of grafted cells, and these sites exhibited stably restored cerebral blood flow (CBF) (approximately 85% of normal CBF). Angiogenesis was present in sites either immediately adjacent to or surrounded by the grafted cells. Our data indicate that map-ISODATA accurately and dynamically characterizes the ischemic lesion and its response to cell therapy.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate a novel alternative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) approach using oscillating gradients preparation (OGSE) to obtain much shorter effective diffusion times (Delta(eff)) for tumor response monitoring by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping in a glioblastoma mouse model.
Methods and Materials: Twenty-four BALBc nude mice inoculated with U87 glioblastoma cells were randomized into a control group and an irradiation group, which underwent a 15-day fractioned radiation therapy (RT) course with 2 Gyd. Therapy response was assessed bymapping of ADCs at 6 time points using an in-house implementation of a cos-OGSE DWI sequence with Delta(eff) = 1.25 ms and compared with a standard pulsed gradient DWI protocol (PGSE) with typical clinical diffusion time Delta(eff) = 18 ms. Longitudinal ADC changes in tumor and contralateral white matter (WM) were statistically assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance and post hoc (Sidak) testing.; Results: On short Delta(eff) OGSE maps tumor ADC was generally 30%-50% higher than in surrounding WM. Areas correlated well with histology. Tumor identification was generally more difficult on PGSE maps owing to nonsignificant WMtumor contrast. During RT, OGSE maps also showed significant tumor ADC increase (approximately 15%) in response to radiation, consistently seen after 14-Gy RT dose. The clinical reference (PGSE) showed lower sensitivity to radiation changes, and no significant response across the radiation group and time course could be detected.; Conclusion: Our short Delta(eff) DWI method using OGSE better reflected histologically defined tumor areas and enabled more consistent and earlier detection of microstructural radiation changes than conventional methods. Oscillating gradients preparation offers significant potential as a robust microstructural RT response biomarker, potentially helping to shift important therapy decisions to earlier stages in the RT time course.

N2  -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential clinical tool for detecting the abnormalities such as tumors and clots in the human brain. The brain MR images are contaminated by artifacts and noise that follow Rician distribution during the acquisition process. It causes the loss of fine details information, distortion, and a blurred vision of the image. A reshaped Gabor filter-based denoising technique is proposed to overcome these issues. To develop the reshaped Gabor filter, the range of reshaping parameters of the filter is initially obtained by a random search method. Further, to evaluate the better performance of the proposed filter, a manual search is used to find the optimal parametric values and tested on T1, T2, and PD weighted MR data sets one by one. Also, the proposed technique is compared with the existing state of the art filtering methods such as Wiener, Median, Partial differential equation (PDE), Anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF), Non-local means filter (NLM), Modified complex diffusion filter (MCD), Multichannel residual learning of CNN (MRL), Maximum a posteriori (MAP), Adaptive non-local means algorithm (ADNLM), and Advance NLM filtering with non-sub sampled (AVNLMNS) on the basic reference and no reference parameter. The parameters such as mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), perception-based image quality evaluator (PIQE), and blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQE) are evaluated on T1, T2, and PD weighted MR images with different noise variances such as 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 9%. The proposed method may be used as a better denoising scheme for Rician distributed noise, edge preservation, fine details restoration, and enhancement of abnormalities.

N2  -  Focal ischemia may induce pathological alterations in brain areas distant from the primary lesion. In animal models, exofocal neuron death in the ipsilateral midbrain has been described after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Using sequential magnetic resonance imaging (T2- and diffusion-weighted) at 3 Tesla, we investigated acute ischemic stroke patients on days 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10 after stroke onset. Sixteen consecutive patients who had suffered a stroke involving the caudate nucleus and/or putamen of either hemisphere were recruited into the study. Four additional patients with strokes sparing the caudate nucleus and putamen but encompassing at least one-third of the MCA territory served as controls. Ischemic lesions involving striatal structures resulted in hyperintense lesions in ipsilateral midbrain that emerged between days 6 and 10 after stroke and were not present on the initial scans. In contrast, none of the control stroke patients developed secondary midbrain lesions. Hyperintense lesions in the pyramidal tract or the brain stem caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tract could be clearly distinguished from these secondary midbrain gray matter lesions and were detectable from day 2 after ischemia. Co-registration of high-resolution images with a digitized anatomic atlas revealed localization of secondary lesions primarily in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the secondary lesions showed a delayed sharp decline through day 10. Normalization of ADC values was observed at late measurements. Taken together, our study demonstrates that striatal infarction elicits delayed degenerative changes in ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW

N2  -  Diffuse gliomas are infiltrative primary brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite multimodal treatment. Maximum safe resection is recommended whenever feasible. The extent of resection (EOR) is positively correlated with survival. Identification of glioma tissue during surgery is difficult due to its diffuse nature. Therefore, glioma resection is imaging-guided, making the choice for imaging technique an important aspect of glioma surgery. The current standard for resection guidance in non-enhancing gliomas is T2 weighted or T2w-fluid attenuation inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in enhancing gliomas T1-weighted MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Other MRI sequences, like magnetic resonance spectroscopy, imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography, as well as intraoperative imaging techniques, including the use of fluorescence, are also available for the guidance of glioma resection. The neurosurgeon's goal is to find the balance between maximizing the EOR and preserving brain functions since surgery-induced neurological deficits result in lower quality of life and shortened survival. This requires localization of important brain functions and white matter tracts to aid the pre-operative planning and surgical decision-making. Visualization of brain functions and white matter tracts is possible with functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography, and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this review, we discuss the current available imaging techniques for the guidance of glioma resection and the localization of brain functions and white matter tracts.

N2  -  Clinical course and serial neuroimaging findings are not fully described in children who have had neurological sequelae following status epilepticus. We found four patients who had neurological sequelae out of 42 children with status epilepticus in 2004. MRI studies were reviewed with specific attention to diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a and interieukin-6, were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (3 patients). The clinical course showed biphasic; initial status epilepticus and neurological exacerbation along with seizure recurrence four to five days after onset. Within three days after initial status epilepticus, CT (all patients) and MRI (2 patients) did not show any abnormalities. From four to ten days after onset, MRI demonstrated diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter on DWI and hypointensity on ADC maps in all patients. Diffuse brain atrophy progressed thereafter. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-6 was elevated in all patients. A biphasic clinical course may be a specific feature for neurological sequelae. The preferential white matter involvement on MRI and elevated CSF cytokines indicate that glial dysfunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of status epilepticus-associated cerebral damage.

N2  -  The hypothesis was tested that the intravoxel distribution of water diffusion rates, as measured with a stretched-exponential model of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), is a marker of brain tumor invasion. Eight rats underwent intracerebral inoculation of C6 glioma cells. In three rats, cells were labeled with a fluorescent dye for microscopy. One rat was inoculated with a saline solution, and five more rats were imaged without inoculation as controls. Five healthy uninoculated rats were also imaged. DWI was performed 14-15 days after inoculation, with diffusion-weighting factor b = 500 to 6500 sec/mm(2), and the resulting signal attenuation was fitted with the stretched-exponential model. The heterogeneity index values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the peritumor ROI than in normal gray matter and significantly higher than in normal white matter. The distributed diffusion coefficient values were significantly lower than in normal white matter or normal gray matter. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of tumors in the peritumor region that could be histologically distinguished from the main tumor mass. There was no change in proton density or T-2-weighted images in the peritumor region, making vasogenic edema unlikely as a source of contrast. It is therefore thought that the heterogeneity parameter alpha is a marker of brain tumor invasion. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Two techniques, the translongitudinal cerebral fissure and transfrontal cortical approach, can be employed to resect posterior cingulate gyrus tumors. We demonstrate the transcortical technique comprising of multimodal imaging guidance and awake brainmapping which enabled maximum safe resection of dominant cingulate gyrus glioma.
The patient, a 49-yr-old female, came to clinic after experiencing headache for a month. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a nonenhancing lesion of the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Threedimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the cholineN-acetyl-aspartate index (CNI) which strongly suggested a low-grade glioma diagnosis.; In surgery, after creating a tailed bone window and dural opening, strip electrode was placed across the central sulcus for continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. Next, direct cortical stimulation was done to map functional cortical areas. The transcortical approach was chosen at this point because many veins hindered hemisphere retraction. Noneloquent cortical incisions were made and the tumor was carefully debunked with a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. The corpus callosum marked the deep end of dissection. Subcortical mapping combined with diffusion tensor imaging tractography-based navigation was performed to localize motor and language tracks. Intraoperative MRI evaluation confirmed a gross total resection. Pathological and molecular analysis revealed a World Health Organization Grade II IDH-wildtype Diffuse Astrocytoma diagnosis. Since the patient falls in high-risk group, she was also administered radiation and chemotherapy. Long-term cognitive evaluation follow-up of the patient showed she had good functional recovery with no obvious long-term deficits.; Informed patient consent was obtained.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted MR imaging has been used in studies on experimental animal models and on patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Compared with CT and conventional MR techniques, diffusion-weighted imaging can provide earlier and more precise detection of the location and the extent of an ischemic lesion during the critical first few hours after the onset of stroke.
Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping of the brain water can also be carried out by recording a series of diffusion-weighted images with different amplitudes of the displacement encoding gradients. ADC maps can provide important information about the extra- and intracellular water homeostasis. ADC reduction of the tissue water is one of the early signals of the pathophysiological cascade resulting from ischemic tissue injury. Diffusion MR imaging has become a valuable tool in stroke research. II may also prove a valuable tool in monitoring the efficiency of therapeutic effects in stroke patients.; It is our intention to provide an overview of the recent development in this area with emphasis on the diffusion-weighted MR techniques, and to discuss the possible underlying biophysical mechanisms responsible for the contrast of diffusion-weighted imaging.

N2  -  Tomographic perfusion imaging techniques are integral to translational stroke research paradigms that advance our understanding of the disease. Functional ultrasound (fUS) is an emerging technique that informs on cerebral blood volume (CBV) through ultrasensitive Doppler and flow velocity (CBFv) through ultrafast localization microscopy. It is not known how experimental results compare with a classical CBV-probing technique such as dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI (DSC-MRI). To that end, we assessed hemodynamics based on uUS (n = 6) or DSC-MRI (n = 7) before, during and up to three hours after 90-minute filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Recanalization was followed by a brief hyperperfusion response, after which CBV and CBFv temporarily normalized but progressively declined after one hour in the lesion territory. DSC-MRI data corroborated the incomplete restoration of CBV after recanalization, which may have been caused by the free-breathing anesthetic regimen. During occlusion, MCAO-induced hypoperfusion was more discrepant between either technique, likely attributable to artefactual signal mechanisms related to slow flow, and processing algorithms employed for either technique. In vivo uUS- and DSC-MRI-derived measures of CBV enable serial whole-brain assessment of post-stroke hemodynamics, but readouts from both techniques need to be interpreted cautiously in situations of very low blood flow.

N2  -  Background: To look for microstructural white matter alterations in patients with dystonia due to Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration.
Material and methods: We examined 21 genetically confirmed patients and an age-matched group of 21 healthy controls by diffusion tensor imaging. Evaluation of data was performed by tract-based spatial statistics analysis and a voxel-wise comparison of calculated maps of fractional anisotropy. Findings were compared between groups and correlated to the dystonia score of the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Scale (p <= 0.05).; Results: Patients showed reductions of fractional anisotropy mainly in the periventricular substance surrounding the third ventricle, in the medial part of both putamina and in the frontal white matter including the anterior limbs of the internal capsules and the corpus callosum. Infratentorially, the cerebellar white matter and dorsal parts of the pons and medulla were affected.; Conclusion: In addition to cortical grey matter changes, we now have a second structural finding pointing to a more widespread affection of cerebral tissue in PKAN dystonia than just the lesion and iron accumulation in the globus pallidus.

N2  -  PurposeTo evaluate convex optimized diffusion encoding (CODE) gradient waveforms for minimum echo time and bulk motion-compensated diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
MethodsDiffusion-encoding gradient waveforms were designed for a range of b-values and spatial resolutions with and without motion compensation using the CODE framework. CODE, first moment (M-1) nulled CODE-M-1, and first and second moment (M-2) nulled CODE-M1M2 were used to acquire neuro, liver, and cardiac ADC maps in healthy subjects (n=10) that were compared respectively to monopolar (MONO), BIPOLAR (M-1=0), and motion-compensated (MOCO, M-1+M-2=0) diffusion encoding.; ResultsCODE significantly improved the SNR of neuro ADC maps compared with MONO (19.52.5 versus 14.5 +- 1.9). CODE-M-1 liver ADCs were significantly lower (1.3 +- 0.1 versus 1.8 +- 0.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, ie, less motion corrupted) and more spatially uniform (6% versus 55% ROI difference) than MONO and had higher SNR than BIPOLAR (SNR=14.9 +- 5.3 versus 8.0 +- 3.1). CODE-M1M2 cardiac ADCs were significantly lower than MONO (1.9 +- 0.6 versus 3.8 +- 0.3 x10(-3) mm(2)s) throughout the cardiac cycle and had higher SNR than MOCO at systole (9.1 +- 3.9 versus 7.0 +- 2.6) while reporting similar ADCs (1.5 +- 0.2 versus 1.4 +- 0.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)s).; ConclusionsCODE significantly improved SNR for ADC mapping in the brain, liver and heart, and significantly improved DWI bulk motion robustness in the liver and heart.

N2  -  Essential language sites and the arcuate fasciculus (AF) have been extensively researched. However, the relationship between them remains insufficiently studied, especially in healthy people. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is increasingly used in language mapping. While enjoying the advantage of non-invasiveness, it is also capable of inducing a virtual lesion in the brain. Thus, it offers the possibility of using the virtual-lesion method to study the healthy brain. This study combined nTMS and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to investigate the relationship between essential language sites and the AF in 30 healthy right-handed volunteers. A total of 143 essential language sites were identified using nTMS, and a total of 175 AF terminations were identified using DTI tractography. Sixty-six sites had a direct correlation with the AF, accounting for 46% of the total essential language sites. Forty-seven AF terminations harbored essential language sites, accounting for 27% of the total AF terminations. Upon data rendering to the cortical parcellation system, a region-related heterogeneity of the correlation rate was found. This study provides the first data on the relationship between essential language sites and the AF in healthy adults.

N2  -  Using echo planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, we measured three-dimensional changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water in eight contiguous coronal slices, encompassing the entire rat brain, before and after local cortical stimulation. We applied chemical (potassium chloride application; n = 6) and mechanical (needle stab; n = 4) stimulations to the right posterior parietal rat cortex. In all animals in which potassium chloride or the needle stab was applied, a region of decreased ADC values to a mean of 0.45 +/- 0.03 x 10(-5) cm(2)/s occurred. These reduced ADC levels appeared in the posterior parietal cortex within 1 min after cortical stimulation and the change recovered within 1 min. Then a ripple-like movement of similar changes developed across the unilateral cortex. This change was localized to the cortex and no significant ADC changes occurred in subcortical structures. The propagating speed of this movement was 3.4 +/- 0.5 mm/min. These findings are compatible with spreading depression as observed electrophysiologically. Similar ADC changes occurred in areas distinct from the ischemic lesion in 3 of 12 animals subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. This magnetic resonance method could detect spreading ADC decline if it occurred in human diseases including brain ischemia.

N2  -  Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of bright edge sign observed on high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) map in glioma patients.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected database for gliomas. Bright edge sign was defined as the presence of extremely high signal in tumor margin on high b-value DWI map (b = 3,000 smm(2)) with the signal intensity higher than those in contralateral normal white matter and tumor central region. Extremely poor prognosis was defined as overall survival time < 9 months. Survival analyses were conducted by using the Cox regression for both the univariable and multivariable analyses.; Results: A total of 52 patients were enrolled (WHO IV, 25; WHO III, 13; WHO II, 14). Bright edge sign presented in 10 (19.2%) patients (WHO IV, 5; WHO III, 3; WHO II, 2). Nine (90.0%) patients with bright edge sign had extremely poor prognosis, while only 1 (2.4 %) patient without bright edge sign had extremely poor prognosis. The sensitivity and specificity of bright edge sign in determining extremely poor prognosis were 90 and 97.7%, respectively. Bright edge sign (HR 95% CI = 25.11 7.26-86.81, p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of poor prognosis after adjustment.; Conclusion: Bright edge sign on high b-value DWI may be an accurate predictor of extremely poor prognosis in glioma patients, regardless of pathologic grades.

N2  -  pH-weighted amide proton transfer (APT) MRI is sensitive to tissue pH change during acute ischemia, complementing conventional perfusion and diffusion stroke imaging. However, the currently used pH-weighted magnetization transfer (MT) ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) analysis is of limited pH specificity. To overcome this, MT and relaxation normalized APT (MRAPT) analysis has been developed that to homogenize the background signal, thus providing highly pH conspicuous measurement. Our study aimed to calibrate MRAPT MRI toward absolute tissue pH mapping and determine regional pH changes during acute stroke. Using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats, we performed lactate MR spectroscopy and multi-parametric MRI. MRAPT MRI was calibrated against a region of interest (ROI)-based pH spectroscopy measurement (R-2 = 0.70, P < 0.001), showing noticeably higher correlation coefficient than the simplistic MTRasym index. Capitalizing on this, we mapped brain tissue pH and semi-automatically segmented pH lesion, in addition to routine perfusion and diffusion lesions. Tissue pH from regions of the contralateral normal, perfusion/diffusion lesion mismatch and diffusion lesion was found to be 7.03 +/- 0.04, 6.84 +/- 0.10, 6.52 +/- 0.19, respectively. Most importantly, we delineated the heterogeneous perfusion/diffusion lesion mismatch into perfusion/pH and pH/diffusion lesion mismatches, with their pH being 7.01 +/- 0.04 and 6.71 +/- 0.12, respectively (P < 0.05). To summarize, our study calibrated pH-sensitive MRAPT MRI toward absolute tissue pH mapping, semi-automatically segmented and determined graded tissue pH changes in ischemic tissue and demonstrated its feasibility for refined demarcation of heterogeneous metabolic disruption following acute stroke.

N2  -  One of the major issues in the surgical treatment of gliomas is the concern about maximizing the extent of resection while minimizing neurological impairment. Thus, surgical planning by carefully observing the relationship between the glioma infiltration area and eloquent area of the connecting fibers is crucial. Neurosurgeons usually detect an eloquent area by functional MRI and identify a connecting fiber by diffusion tensor imaging. However, during surgery, the accuracy of neuronavigation can be decreased due to brain shift, but the positional information may be updated by intraoperative MRI and the next steps can be planned accordingly. In addition, various intraoperative modalities may be used to guide surgery, including neurophysiological monitoring that provides real-time information (e.g., awake surgery, motor-evoked potentials, and sensory evoked potential); photodynamic diagnosis, which can identify high-grade glioma cells; and other imaging techniques that provide anatomical information during the surgery. In this review, we present the historical and current context of the intraoperative MRI and some related approaches for an audience active in the technical, clinical, and research areas of radiology, as well as mention important aspects regarding safety and types of devices.

N2  -  Purpose: Cancer angiogenesis can be imaged by using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Pharmacokinetic modeling can be used to assess vascular perfusion and permeability, but the assessment of angiogenic changes in the microvascular architecture remains challenging. This article presents 2 models enabling the characterization of the microvascular architecture by DCE-MRI.
Theory: The microvascular architecture is reflected in the dispersion coefficient according to the convective dispersion equation. A solution of this equation, combined with the Tofts model, permits defining a dispersion model for magnetic resonance imaging. A reduced dispersion model is also presented.; Methods: The proposed models were evaluated for prostate cancer diagnosis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and concentration-time curves were calculated in each voxel. The simultaneous generation of parametric maps related to permeability and dispersion was obtained through model fitting. A preliminary validation was carried out through comparison with the histology in 15 patients referred for radical prostatectomy.; Results: Cancer localization was accurate with both dispersion models, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve greater than 0.8. None of the compared parameters, aimed at assessing vascular permeability and perfusion, showed better results.; Conclusions: A new DCE-MRI method is proposed to characterize the microvascular architecture through the assessment of intravascular dispersion, without the need for separate arterial-input-function estimation. The results are promising and encourage further research.

N2  -  Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations within the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene. While a small number of reports on imaging findings in routine MRI exist, reported imaging findings in DWI and spectroscopy are scarce, and limited to not genetically proven case reports. We assessed MRI including DWI and MR spectroscopy in six patients with HDLS and two asymptomatic mutation carriers. A total of 13 MRIs were evaluated and a score of the white-matter lesion (WML) load was calculated. The course of MR abnormalities was followed for 6-19 months in four patients and 95 months in one carrier. MRI revealed widespread white-matter lesions of patchy or confluent pattern especially in the frontal and occipital lobe. The pyramidal tract was less affected than the surrounding tissue in all symptomatic patients on conventional T2WI. Three of four cases with DWI showed small dots of diffusion restriction within WML. Spectroscopy showed increased levels of mIns, Cho and lactate while NAA was decreased. Asymptomatic mutation carriers had, for the age of the patients, unusually pronounced unspecific WMLs. No diffusion restriction or alterations in metabolite levels could be detected in asymptomatic mutation carriers. Microbleeds were not found in any patient. Diffusion restriction seems to be a typical imaging pattern visible in patients with active disease progression in HDLS. Spectroscopic findings and the absence of microbleeds differ clearly from reported findings in CADASIL and subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. While the distribution and character of WMLs in asymptomatic cases remain unspecific they are likely to represent subclinical markers of HDLS.

N2  -  Myelin vacuolization has previously been documented by MRI with histopathologic correlation in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. This paper presents a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 with MRI findings consistent with a prominent form of myelin vacuolization, unilaterally involving the right thalamus, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. On MRI, they appeared as multiple nodular-ovoid structures with a layered configuration. They were hypointense on T1-weighted, and FLAIR images, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. On the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of an echo-planar diffusion imaging sequence, their ADC value ranged between 1.98 and 2.27 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, a value higher than that of normal cerebral parenchyma, less than that of CSF.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate the application of laplacian-regularized mean apparent propagator (MAPL)-MRI to brain glioma-induced corticospinal tract (CST) injury. Materials and Methods: This study included 20 patients with glioma adjacent to the CST pathway who had undergone structural and diffusion MRI. The entire CSTs of the affected and healthy sides were reconstructed, and the peritumoral CSTs were manually segmented. The morphological characteristics of the CST (track number, average length, volume, displacement of the affected CST) were examined and the diffusion parameter values, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean squared displacement (MSD), q-space inverse variance (QIV), return to-origin probability (RTOP), return-to-axis probabilities (RTAP), and return-to-plane probabilities (RTPP) along the entire and peritumoral CSTs, were calculated. The entire and peritumoral CST characteristics of the affected and healthy sides as well as those relative CST characteristics of the patients with motor weakness and normal motor function were compared. Results: The track number, volume, MD, RD, MSD, QIV, RTAP, RTOP, and RTPP of the entire and peritumoral CSTs changed significantly for the affected side, whereas the AD and FA changed significantly only in the peritumoral CST (p < 0.05). In patients with motor weakness, the relative MSD of the entire CST, QIV of the entire and peritumoral CSTs, and the AD, MD, RD of the peritumoral CST were significantly higher, whereas the RTPP of the entire and peritumoral CSTs and the RTOP of the peritumoral CST were significantly lower than those in patients with normal motor function (p < 0.05 for all). In contrast, no significant changes were found in the CST morphological characteristics, FA, or RTAP (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusion: MAPL-MRI is an effective approach for evaluating microstructural changes after CST injury. Its sensitivity may improve when using the peritumoral CST features.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - Determination of the presence or absence of ischemic penumbra through diffusion-perfusion mismatch requires rapid delineation of both abnormalities. Although singular value decomposition - based perfusion parameter estimation has offered valuable insights into the underlying cerebral hemodynamics, the associated postprocessing procedures have limited its widespread use. We explored the utility of a simple technique to define perfusion abnormality in acute stroke patients.
Methods - Twenty acute stroke patients were studied. The MR dynamic contrast approach was used to obtain cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time (MTT). Temporal correlation was used to correlate 4 reference functions - an arterial input function (AIF), a normal tissue function, a lesion function, and a venous output function - with dynamic contrast MR images, and correlation coefficients (CCs) were calculated pixel by pixel. In addition, chronic-state T2-weighted images were coregistered onto the images acquired acutely for assessing the sensitivity and specificity of CC-defined lesion.; Results - Statistically significant differences in cerebral blood flow and MTT were found between CC-defined normal and abnormal tissues with all 4 reference functions used. When the final infarct volume was used as the gold standard, a similar sensitivity between MTT (78%) and AIF (76%) CC-defined lesion was obtained, whereas the specificity was higher for AIF ( 61%) than that obtained with MTT-defined lesion (52%).; Conclusions - We explored CC maps as a simpler alternative of estimating perfusion abnormality, and results demonstrated the potential clinical utility of a correlation-based technique for estimating brain perfusion status.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to elucidate some characteristics of tissue microstructure inaccessible to other MRI techniques.
Objective: To investigate whether normal-appearing brain tissue abnormalities occur in patients with multiple sclerosis at the earliest clinical stage and whether their severity is predictive of a short-term disease evolution by using DT MRI.; Design: Forty-five patients and 22 healthy control subjects were studied. All patients had had a clinically isolated syndrome within the 3 months preceding study enrollment and paraclinical evidence of disease dissemination in space. During a single session, dual-echo, pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted images of the brain were obtained from each subject. In patients, dual-echo and enhanced images were obtained after 3 and 12 months, to detect MRI signs of disease dissemination in time. An on-study neurological examination was also conducted to ascertain the occurrence of clinical relapses. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps were derived from DT images. Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal-appearing gray matter mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy histograms were produced and analyzed.; Results: During the study period, 29 patients showed MRI evidence of disease dissemination in time. When compared with healthy controls, patients showed higher average NAWM mean diffusivity (P=.01), lower average NAWM mean-diffusivity peak height (P <.001), and fractional anisotropy (P<.001). The DT MRI characteristics of patients did not differ between those with and those without disease dissemination in time at follow-up.; Conclusions: In patients with multiple sclerosis at the earliest clinical stage, the severity of NAWM damage does not predict new lesion formation in the short term, suggesting that the "diffuse" component of tissue damage is, at least, partially, independent of the "discrete," predominantly inflammatory aspects of the disease since its clinical onset.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gadolinium-enhanced MR images assist in defining tumor borders; however, the relation between tumor cell extent and contrast-enhanced regions is unclear. Our aim was to improve conventional neuroimaging of pediatric brain tumors with hemodynamic, diffusion, and spectroscopic MR imaging.
METHODS: We performed conventional MR and MR spectroscopic imaging in 31 children with neuroglial brain tumors. Hemodynamic MR imaging was performed in 16 patients with a first-pass intravenous bolus of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA); apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured in 12 patients. To account for multiple measurements in a patient, we used a nested analysis of variance.; RESULTS: At MR spectroscopy, choline (Cho) -containing compounds (indicating tumor) and lipid levels (indicating necrosis) did not correlate with percent Gd-DTPA enhancement on MR images. Percent enhancement was positively correlated with relative cerebral blood volumes (rCBVs) (P =.05) and negatively correlated with ADCs (P <.001). Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that rCBV (P =.008), ADC (P =.022), and lipid (P <.001) levels were significant independent predictors of percent enhancement. Tumor spectral patterns were detected in tumor regions and outside enhancing tumor beds in patients with clinical progression; these were confirmed at neuropathologic analysis.; CONCLUSION. MR spectroscopic imaging improves the assessment of pediatric brain tumors by adding biochemical information regarding tumor involvement and by depicting residual or recurrent tumor outside the Gd-DTPA-enhanced tumor bed. rCBV and ADC mapping complemented MR spectroscopic imaging. We recommend the use of MR spectroscopic imaging in addition to conventional MR imaging in assessing pediatric brain tumors.

N2  -  Assessment of CNS neoplasms has focused traditionally on morphological analysis. Recent developments in MR sequence design now enable functional assessments. T1-weighted, as well as T2*-weighted, dynamic, gadolinium-enhanced, imaging can be used for assessment of vascularisation, permeability, and microcirculation of CNS neoplasms. characterisation of cerebrovascular blood flow is possible using dynamic MR angiography, while neurofunctional imaging enables visualisation of local alterations in neuronal activity in stimulated cortical areas, Diffusion-weighted imaging can be used for improved delineation of neoplasms, while chemical shift imaging allows metabolic mapping of lesions and surrounding tissues. Implementation of these techniques scan improve characterisation, information for therapy, planning and prognosis in clinical imaging of CNS neoplasms.

N2  -  Objective: The relationship between tumor consistency and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values is controversial. We evaluated the role of the ADC using an advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technique. We employed periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) DWI acquired on a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to assess the consistency of pituitary adenomas and examined the relationship between the ADC and the hormone secretion status of the tumors and their MIB-1 labeling index (MIB-1 LI).
Materials and methods: The study protocol was approved by our institutional review board. We retrospectively studied 24 operated patients with pituitary adenomas who had undergone PROPELLER DWI on a 3-T MRI scanner. Conventional MRI findings were expressed as the ratio of the signal intensity (SI) in the lesions to the SI of the normal white matter and the degree of contrast enhancement. Minimum-, mean-, and maximum ADC (ADC(min), ADC(mean), ADC(max)) values were calculated. The consistency of the tumors was determined by neurosurgeons. All surgical specimens were submitted for histological study to calculate the MIB-1 LI and the percent collagen content. Preoperative MRI-, intraoperative-, and histological findings were analyzed by a statistician.; Results: Our study included 15 soft-, 5 fibrous-, and 4 hard tumors. Tumor consistency was strongly associated with the percent collagen content. However, neither the tumor consistency nor the percent collagen content was correlated with MRI findings or ADC values. The SI of growth hormone-producing adenomas on T2-WI was lower than of the other pituitary adenomas studied (p < 0.01); no other significant difference was found in the ADC or on conventional MRI between pituitary adenomas with different secretory functions. The MIB-1 LI of pituitary adenomas was not correlated with their appearance on conventional MRI or their ADC values.; Conclusion: Using the PROPELLER DWI technique we confirmed that the ADC was not correlated with the consistency of pituitary adenomas. We also demonstrate that the ADC was not associated with the hormone-secreting status or the MIB-1 LI of pituitary adenomas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a machine learning method based on texture parameters in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiating glioblastoma (GB) from brain metastases (METs).
Materials and methods: In this retrospective study conducted between November 2008 and July 2017, we included 73 patients diagnosed with GB (n = 73) and METs (n = 53) who underwent contrast-enhanced 3 T brain MRI. Twelve histogram and texture parameters were assessed on T2-weighted images (T2WIs), apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADCs), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WIs). A prediction model was developed for a machine learning method, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was calculated through 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, machine learning method's performance was compared with three board-certified radiologists' judgments.; Results: Univariate logistic regression model showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was highest with the standard value of T2WIs (0.78), followed by the maximum value of T2WIs (0.764), minimum value of T2WIs (0.738), minimum values of CE-T1WIs and contrast of T2WIs (0.733), and mean value of T2WIs (0.724). AUC calculated using the support vector machine was comparable to that calculated by the three radiologists (0.92 vs. 0.72, p <.01; 0.92 vs. 0.73, p <.01; and 0.92 vs. 0.86, p =.096).; Conclusion: In differentiating GB from METs on the basis of texture parameters in MRI, the performance of the machine learning method based on convention MRI was superior to that of the univariate method, and comparable to that of the radiologists.

N2  -  Importance: Gliomas, tumors of the central nervous system, are classically diagnosed through invasive surgical biopsy and subsequent histopathological study. Innovations in ultra-high field (UHF) imaging, namely 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (7T MRI) are advancing preoperative tumor grading, visualization of intratumoral structures, and appreciation of small brain structures and lesions.& nbsp;Objective: Summarize current innovative uses of UHF imaging techniques in glioma diagnostics and treatment.& nbsp;Methods: A systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was performed utilizing PubMed. Case reports and series, observational clinical trials, and randomized clinical trials written in English were included. After removing unrelated studies and those with non-human subjects, only those related to 7T MRI were independently reviewed and summarized for data extraction. Some preclinical animal models are briefly described to demonstrate future usages of ultra-high-field imaging.& nbsp;Results: We reviewed 46 studies (43 human and 3 animal models) which reported clinical usages of UHF MRI in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. Current literature generally supports greater resolution imaging from 7T compared to 1.5T or 3T MRI, improving visualization of cerebral microbleeds and white and gray matter, and providing more precise localization for radiotherapy targeting. Additionally, studies found that diffusion or susceptibility-weighted imaging techniques applied to 7T MRI, may be used to predict tumor grade, reveal intratumoral structures such as neovasculature and microstructures like axons, and indicate isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status in preoperative imaging. Similarly, newer imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging can be performed on 7T MRI to predict tumor grading and treatment efficacy. Geometrical distortion, a known challenge of 7T MRI, was at a tolerable level in all included studies.& nbsp;Conclusion: UHF imaging has the potential to preoperatively and non-invasively grade gliomas, provide precise therapy target areas, and visualize lesions not seen on conventional MRI.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the use of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography for neurosurgical guidance of transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) thalamotomy for essential tremor (ET).
Materials and methods: Eight patients with medication-refractory ET were treated with tcMRgFUS targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Diffusion and structural MRI data and clinical evaluations were acquired pre-treatment and post-treatment. To identify the optimal target location, tractography was performed on pre-treatment diffusion MRI data between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus. The tractography-identified locations were compared to the lesion location delineated on 1 year post-treatment T-2-weighted MR image. Their overlap was correlated with the clinical outcomes measured by the percentage change of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores acquired pre-treatment, as well as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment.; Results: The probabilistic tractography was consistent from subject-to-subject and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract. Higher overlap between the tractography-identified location and the tcMRgFUS treatment-induced lesion highly correlated with better treatment outcome (r=-0.929, -0.75, -0.643, p=0.00675, 0.0663, 0.139 for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus, respectively, at 1 year post-treatment). The correlation for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex is the highest for all time points (r=-0.719, -0.976, -0.707, -0.929, p=0.0519, 0.000397, 0.0595, 0.00675 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment, respectively).; Conclusion: Our data support the use of diffusion tractography as a complementary approach to current targeting methods for tcMRgFUS thalamotomy.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) the corpus callosum (CC) is often and early affected by macroscopic lesions when investigated by conventional MRI. We sought to determine to which extent microstructural and effective disconnection of the CC are already present in RRMS patients at the earliest stages of the disease prior to evidence of macroscopic CC lesion. We compared 16 very early RRMS patients (median expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 1.5; range, 0-2.0) to an age-matched group of healthy controls and focused analysis to the motor CC, i.e. that part of the CC relaying interhemispheric motor information. A combined functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging fiber-tracking procedure was applied to identify the callosal motor fibers (CMFs) connecting the hand areas of the primary motor cortices of the two hemispheres. Fractional anisotropy (FA) within the motor CC (FA-CC) assessed the CMF microstructural integrity. Bifocal paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) tested short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (S-IHI), an established measure of CMF effective connectivity. FA-CC and S-IHI were significantly reduced in early RRMS compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, a significant linear correlation between microstructure (FA-CC) and function (S-IHI) in the controls was broken down in the patients. These abnormalities were obtained in the absence of macroscopic CMF lesion in conventional MRI, and whilst motor hand/arm function in the nine-hole-peg test and corticospinal conduction time were normal. Findings suggest that reductions in FA and S-IHI may serve as surrogate markers of motor callosal disconnection at the earliest stages of RRMS prior to development of macroscopic lesion.

T2  -  NEUROSURGERY QUARTERLY

N2  -  Over the last decade, neurosurgeons have become increasingly reliant on image guidance to perform surgery more safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively. Neuronavigational systems are either frame based or frameless and rely on the acquisition of computed tomography or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) scans that are obtained either a few days or immediately before surgery to generate a 3-dimensional coordinate set. Unfortunately, neuronavigational systems do not allow the neurosurgeon to adjust for dynamic changes that occur during surgery such as brain shift. More recently, intraoperative MR (iMR) imaging systems have been developed and implemented to treat neurosurgical diseases. These systems consist of a low-field (0.12 or 0.23 T), midfleld (0-5 T), or high-field (1.5 T) MR imaging scanner located in an environment that allows general anesthesia to be administered. The main advantage of iMR imaging is the excellent soft tissue discrimination and 3-dimensional visualization of the operative site. Enhanced visualization of an intracranial target allows for a safe surgical trajectory to be chosen that avoids critical structures, the determination of the extent of the tumor resection, and the exclusion of intraoperative hemorrhage. All iMRI systems can provide the neurosurgeon with basic T1- and T2-weighted imaging sequences. High-field Mill systems can also perform advanced functional capabilities such as MR spectroscopy, functional MR imaging, MR venography (MRV), MR angiography (MRA), chemical shift imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging, however. These MR imaging sequences can provide additional information that may facilitate the success of the operative procedure. identifying critical vascular structures with MRV and MRA may prevent their inadvertent injury during surgery. Locating an area of elevated choline level within a tumor at the time of biopsy may enhance the diagnostic yield of the procedure. Mapping out areas of neurologic function may influence the choice of the surgical approach to a tumor. In addition to using iMRI to resect tumors, it can be used for placement of deep brain stimulators for Parkinson disease, for the performance of psychosurgery for obsessive-computsive disorder, or for the treatment of common neurosurgical diseases such as hydrocephalus.

N2  -  Intracranial meningiomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Meningiomas account for up to 36% of all brain tumors. The incidence of metastatic brain lesions has not been determined. Up to 30% of adult patients with cancer of one localization or another suffer from a secondary tumor lesion of the brain. The vast majority of meningiomas have meningeal localization; >90% are solitary. The incidence of intracranial dural metastases (IDM) is 8-9% of cases, while in 10% of cases, the brain is the only localization, and in 50% of cases the metastases are solitary. Typically, the task of distinguishing between meningioma and dural metastasis does not involve difficulties. Periodically, there is a situation when the differential diagnosis between these tumors is ambiguous, since meningiomas and solitary IDM may have similar characteristics, in particular, a cavity-less solid structure, limited diffusion of water molecules, the presence of extensive peritumoral edema, and an identical contrast pattern. The present study included 100 patients with newly diagnosed tumors of the CNS, who subsequently underwent examination and neurosurgical treatment at the Federal Center for Neurosurgery with histological verification between May 2019 and October 2022. Depending on the histological conclusion, two study groups of patients were distinguished: The first group consisted of patients diagnosed with intracranial meningiomas (n=50) and the second group of patients were diagnosed with IDM (n=50). The study was performed using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) General Electric Discovery W750 3T before and after contrast enhancement. The diagnostic value of this study was estimated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and area under the curve analysis. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in the differential diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas and IDM was limited by the similarity of the values of the measured diffusion coefficient. The assumption, previously put forward in the literature, regarding the presence of a statistically significant difference in the apparent diffusion coefficient values, which make it possible to differentiate tumors, was not confirmed. When analyzing perfusion data, IDM showed higher cerebral blood flow (CBF) values compared with intracranial meningiomas (P & LE;0.001). A threshold value of the CBF index was revealed, which was 217.9 ml/100 g/min, above which it is possible to predict IDM with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0 and 86.0%, respectively. Diffusion-weighted images are not reliable criteria for differentiating intracranial meningiomas from IDM and should not influence the diagnosis suggested by imaging. The technique for assessing the perfusion of a meningeal lesion makes it possible to predict metastases with a sensitivity and specificity close to 80-90% and deserves attention when making a diagnosis. In the future, in order to reduce the number of false negative and false positive results, mpMRI would require additional criteria to be included in the protocol. Since IDM differs from intracranial meningiomas in the severity of neoangiogenesis and, accordingly, in greater vascular permeability, the technique for assessing vascular permeability (wash-in parameter with dynamic contrast enhancement) may serve as a refining criterion for distinguishing between dural lesions.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To retrospectively measure the diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging characteristics of peritumoral hyperintense white matter (WM) and peritumoral normal-appearing WM, as seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of infiltrative high-grade gliomas and meningiomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with biopsy-proved glioma and nine patients with imaging findings consistent with meningioma and an adjacent hyperintense region on T2-weighted MR images were examined with DW and diffusion-tensor MR imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured on maps generated from isotropic DW images of enhancing tumor, hyperintense regions adjacent to enhancing tumor, normal-appearing WM adjacent to hyperintense regions, and analogous locations in the contralateral WM corresponding to these areas. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured in similar locations on maps generated from diffusion-tensor imaging data. Changes in ADC and FA in each type of tissue were compared across tumor types by using a two-sample t test. P < .05 indicated statistical significance.; RESULTS: Mean ADCs in peritumoral hyperintense regions were 1.309 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (mean percentage of 181% of normal WM) for gliomas and 1.427 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (192% of normal value) for meningiomas (no significant difference). Mean ADCs in peritumoral normal-appearing WM were 0.723 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (106% of normal value) for gliomas and 0.743 x 10(-3) mm(2) sec (102% of normal value) for meningiomas (no significant difference). Mean FA values in peritumoral hyperintense regions were 0.178 (43% of normal WM value) for gliomas and 0.224 (65% of normal value) for meningiomas (P = .05). Mean FA values for peritumoral normal-appearing WM were 0.375 (83% of normal value) for gliomas and 0.404 (100% of normal value) for meningiomas (P = .01).; CONCLUSION: The difference in FA decreases in peritumoral normal-appearing WM between gliomas and meningiomas was significant, and the difference in FA decreases in peritumoral hyperintense regions between these tumors approached but did not reach significance. These findings may indicate a role for diffusion MR imaging in the detection of tumoral infiltration that is not visible on conventional MR images. (C) RSNA, 2004.

N2  -  20% of brain tumor patients present with seizures at the onset of diagnosis, while a further 25-40% develop epileptic seizures as the tumor progresses. Tumor-related epilepsy (TRE) is a condition in which the tumor causes recurring, unprovoked seizures. The occurrence of TRE differs between patients, along with the effectiveness of treatment methods. Therefore, determining the tumor properties that correlate with epilepsy can help guide TRE treatment. This article reviews the MRI sequences and image post-processing algorithms in the study of TRE. It focuses on epilepsy caused by glioma tumors because it is the most common type of malignant brain tumor and it has a high prevalence of epilepsy. In correlational TRE studies, conventional MRI sequences and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) are used to extract variables related to the tumor radiological characteristics, called imaging factors. Image post-processing is used to correlate the imaging factors with the incidence of epilepsy. The earlier studies of TRE used univariate and multivariate analysis to study the correlations between specific variables and incidence of epilepsy. Later, studies used voxel-based morphometry and voxel lesion-symptom mapping. Radiomics has been recently used to post-process the images for the study of TRE. This article will discuss the limitation of the existing imaging modalities and post-processing algorithms. It ends with some suggestions and challenges for future TRE studies.

N2  -  We evaluated the relationship between clinical features and hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII) shown by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in young children with head trauma, comparing inflicted trauma (IT) to accidental trauma (AT). This single-center consecutive cohort study included children age birth to 36 months admitted for head injury July 2001 to December 2004 with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained :5 1 week, identified from prospectively maintained registries of children with trauma. Clinical and radiological data during the hospital stay were extracted from medical records. MRIs were analyzed by study examiners blinded to clinical status and scored by type, severity and location of lesions attributable to traumatic, hypoxic-ischemic, or mixed injury patterns. 30 IT patients and 22 AT patients met inclusion criteria. IT cases were younger than AT, 3.0 versus 8.5 months. Mean time to MRI in IT (2.1 days) was similar to AT (1.9 days). HII was more common in IT (11 of 30) than AT (2/22, p = 0.03). Children with HII more commonly had seizures, needed intubation at presentation, and needed neurosurgical intervention compared to those without HII. Most patients with HII (10/14) required in-patient rehabilitation compared to those without HII (4/38). Our study is the first to characterize HII using diffusion-weighted MRI in young children, comparing IT and AT. The higher rate of HII on DWI-MRI in IT than in AT is likely multifactorial, involving respiratory insufficiency, seizures, and intracranial mass-occupying lesions requiring neurosurgical intervention. HII predicted need for in-patient rehabilitation in a large majority of children.

N2  -  Rationale and objectives Pituitary macroadenomas are predominantly benign intracranial neoplasms that can be locally aggressive with invasion of adjacent structures. Biomarkers of aggressive behavior have been identified in the pathology literature, including the proliferative marker MIB-1. In the radiology literature, diffusion weighted imaging and low ADC values provide similar markers of aggressive behavior in brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a correlation between ADC and MIB-1 in pituitary macroadenomas.
Materials and methods A retrospective review of diffusion imaging and immunohistochemical characteristics of pituitary macroadenomas was performed. The ADC ratio and specimen Ki-67 (MIB-1) indices were measured. Linear regression analysis of normalized ADC values and MIB-1 indices was used to compare these parameters.; Results There were 17 patients with available ADC maps and MIB-1 indices. Local invasion was confirmed by imaging and intraoperative visualization in 11 patients. The mean ADC ratio for the invasive group was 0.68, with a mean MIB-1 index of 2.21 %. In the noninvasive group, the mean ADC ratio was 1.05, with a mean MIB-1 index of 0.9 %. Linear regression analysis of normalized ADC values versus MIB-1 demonstrates a negative correlation, with a linear slope significantly different from zero (p = 0.003, correlation coefficient of 0.77, and r squared = 0.59).; Conclusion We determine a strong correlation of low ADC values and MIB-1, demonstrating the potential of diffusion imaging as a possible biomarker for atypical, proliferative adenomas, which may ultimately affect the surgical approach and postoperative management.

N2  -  The early prediction of consciousness recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) is crucial to make decisions about the appropriate use of prolonged intensive care. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed as a biomarker of white matter injury that could be used in a classification purpose. Instead of region-of-interest-based approach, we applied voxel-based approaches (voxel-based DTI and tract-based spatial statistics) on 30 patients with TBI to identify, without any prior, the brain regions that were specifically damaged in unfavorable 1-year outcome group compared to the favorable one. DTI were acquired at mean 23 days (5-53 days) and two DTI-derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were tested. Our results showed that (1) ADC is not a relevant biomarker for early 1-year outcome prognosis; (2) FA measured in inferior longitudinal fasciculus, in cerebral peduncle, in posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in posterior corpus callosum is specifically decreased in unfavorable outcome group compare to the favorable one; (3) a linear discriminant analysis using the FA measured in these four regions showed good classification performance (sensitivity = 86% and specificity = 86%). These findings confirm the relevance of the use of DTI as biomarkers for consciousness recovery after TBI and support the possible use of these biomarkers for early classification of patients.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The purpose of this study was to develop a novel MRI method for imaging clot lysis in a rat embolic stroke model and to compare tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-based clot lysis with and without recombinant Annexin-2 (rA2).
Methods-In experiment 1 we used in vitro optimization of clot visualization using multiple MRI contrast agents in concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mu L in 250 mu L blood. In experiment 2, we used in vivo characterization of the time course of clot lysis using the clot developed in the previous experiment. Diffusion, perfusion, angiography, and T1-weighted MRI for clot imaging were conducted before and during treatment with vehicle (n=6), tPA (n=8), or rA2 plus tPA (n=8) at multiple time points. Brains were removed for ex vivo clot localization.; Results-Clots created with 25 mu L Magnevist were the most stable and provided the highest contrast-to-noise ratio. In the vehicle group, clot length as assessed by T1-weighted imaging correlated with histology (r=0.93). Clot length and cerebral blood flow-derived ischemic lesion volume were significantly smaller than vehicle at 15 minutes after treatment initiation in the rA2 plus tPA group, whereas in the tPA group no significant reduction from vehicle was observed until 30 minutes after treatment initiation. The rA2 plus tPA group had a significantly shorter clot length than the tPA group at 60 and 90 minutes after treatment initiation and significantly smaller cerebral blood flow deficit than the tPA group at 90 minutes after treatment initiation.; Conclusions-We introduce a novel MRI-based clot imaging method for in vivo monitoring of clot lysis. Lytic efficacy of tPA was enhanced by rA2. (Stroke. 2011; 42: 1110-1115.)

N2  -  Neuroimaging plays an important role in acute stroke diagnosis and management, but it is not routinely used in rehabilitation settings. Incorporating imaging information in rehabilitation planning may eventually translate to better outcomes after stroke. Here we review the prediction of outcomes after stroke using magnetic resonance imaging. There are clear and specific relationships between the anatomy of the stroke lesion and impairments at the time of scanning, and at later time points in recovery. However, most studies demonstrate these relationships in groups of patients at the chronic stage. In order to be useful for rehabilitation, neuroimaging needs to provide prognostic information for individual patients at a much earlier stage. Recent studies have used diffusion tensor imaging and functional neuroimaging to address this, with promising results. Combining neuroimaging with clinical and neurophysiological assessments may also be useful. Future work in this area may support the tailoring of rehabilitation for individual patients based on their capacity for neural reorganization and recovery.

N2  -  Objectives: We used an optimized echo-planar pulse sequence for isotropically weighted diffusion imaging (1) to measure mean diffusivity ((D) over bar) in lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in the entire brain from patients with mildly disabling relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MSS, (2) to compare the (D) over bar. of NAWM from patients with that of white matter from normal controls, (3) to evaluate whether lesions classified on the basis of their appearance on enhanced T1-weighted scans have different (D) over bar, and (4) to investigate the relationship between diffusion changes in lesions and NAWM.
Methods: Dual-echo and diffusion-weighted scans were obtained from 35 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 24 sex- and age-matched normal controls. Postcontrast T1-weighted images were also obtained from the patients. After creating (D) over bar maps and image coregistration, values were measured for MS lesions larger than 5 mm and for 22 NAWM areas from each subject.; Results: All NAWM areas studied had significantly higher (D) over bar in patients than in controls. A total of 173 lesions were identified on the dual-echo scans from patients. The average (D) over bar for these lesions was significantly higher than that of NAWM. Twenty-two lesions were enhancing and 60 were classified as T1-hypointense. No significant difference in (D) over bar values was found between enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, while the average (D) over bar of T1-hypointense lesions was significantly higher than the average (D) over bar of T1-isointense lesions. There was no significant correlation between the average (D) over bar in lesions and NAWM.; Conclusions: This study shows that diffusion-weighted imaging is able to identify MS lesions with severe tissue disruption. It also shows that widespread increased diffusion can be measured in the NAWM from patients with MS, and suggests that such changes are, at least partially, independent of larger abnormalities.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to validate our MR tissue segmentation technique using a hamster brain tumor model and malignant brain tumors in man. We used a multispectral tissue segmentation analysis. Three sets of MRI data were included: proton density, T2-weighted fast spin echo, and T1-weighted spin echo, as inputs. Three image preprocessing steps included correcting image nonuniformity, application of an anisotropic diffusion type filter, and data point selection by a qualified observer. We used the Er-Nearest Neighbor segmentation algorithm, which does not require prior knowledge of the sample distribution. This choice allowed us to optimize the different tissue clusters present in three-dimensional (3D) feature space. In vivo validation of the technique was performed in hamsters harboring tumors induced with JC virus-transformed HJC-15 cells, as compared to three control animals. Human brain tumors obtained by stereotactically guided biopsy in six patients were also included in the study. Finally, brain tumors were removed from two patients who underwent conventional craniotomy using segmentation-derived images as a guide. In the hamsters, 10 tissues were correctly identified by segmentation and were confirmed histologically (P <.02). In the patients, there was also a strong correlation between our segmentation results and the tissue obtained by stereotactic biopsy (P <.01). In one of the two patients who underwent open craniotomy, segmentation images were useful in revealing tumor spread into vital areas of the brain (motor area). In conclusion, the results of segmentation correlate well with the tissues in vivo and thus warrant further clinical utilization and evaluation.

N2  -  This paper presents registration via embedded maps (REM), a deformable registration algorithm for images with varying topology. The algorithm represents 3-D images as 4-D manifolds in a Riemannian space (referred to as embedded maps). Registration is performed as a surface evolution matching one embedded map to another using a diffusion process. The approach differs from those existing in that it takes an a priori estimation of image regions where topological changes are present, for example lesions, and generates a dense vector field representing both the shape and intensity changes necessary to match the images. The algorithm outputs both a diffeomorphic deformation field and an intensity displacement which corrects the intensity difference caused by topological changes. Multiple sets of experiments are conducted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with lesions from OASIS and ADNI datasets. These images are registered to either a brain template or images of healthy individuals. An exemplar case registering a template to an MRI with tumor is also given. The resulting deformation fields were compared with those obtained using diffeomorphic demons, where topological changes are not modeled. These sets of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed REM method for registration of brain MRI with severe topological differences.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Using newly developed computerized image analysis, we studied the heterogeneity of apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC(w)) values in human ischemic stroke within LQ hours of onset.
Methods-Echo-planar trace diffusion-weighted images from 9 patients with focal cortical ischemic stroke were obtained within 10 hours of symptom onset. An Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) clustering algorithm was implemented to segment different tissue types with a series of DW images. ADC(w) maps were calculated from 4 DW images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The segmented zones within the lesion were characterized as low, pseudonormal, or high, expressed as a ratio of the mean+-SD of ADC(w) of contralateral noninvolved tissue.; Results-The average ADC(w) in the ischemic stroke region within 10 hours of onset was significantly depressed compared with homologous contralateral tissue (626.6+-76.8 versus 842.9+-60.4x10(-6) mm(2)s; P<0.0001). Nevertheless, ISODATA segmentation yielded multiple zones within the stroke region that were characterized as low, pseudonormal, and high. The mean proportion of low:pseudonormal:high was 72%:20%:8%.; Conclusions-Despite low average ADC(w), computer-assisted segmentation of DW MRI detected heterogeneous zones within ischemic lesions corresponding to low, pseudonormal, and high ADC(w) not visible to the human eye. This supports acute elevation of ADC(w) in human ischemic stroke and, accordingly, different temporal rates of tissue evolution toward infarction.

N2  -  Background In patients with covert cerebrovascular disease or proximal source of embolism, embolic silent brain infarction may precede major stroke events. Therefore, characterization of particularly cortical silent brain infarction is essential for identifying affected patients and commencing adequate secondary prevention. This study aimed to investigate differences in the distribution pattern of cortical ischemic stroke lesions to assess potential predilection sites of cortical silent brain infarction. Methods and Results We prospectively included all consecutive patients with stroke presenting from January 1 to December 31, 2018. Diffusion-weighted imaging lesions were used to generate voxel-based lesion maps and assigned to atlas-based cortical regions of interest in middle cerebral artery territories. Each region-of-interest lesion frequency was related to the respective region-of-interest volume to identify frequently affected and underrepresented cerebral cortex areas. Diffusion-weighted imaging data for voxel-based lesion maps were available in 334 out of 633 patients. Primary analysis revealed that small- (<0.24 cc) and medium-sized (0.24-2640 cc) lesions distributed predominantly along regions associated with sensorimotor or language function. Detailed analysis within middle cerebral artery territories showed an approximated frequency of missed cortical stroke lesions of up to 67% in the right and 69% in the left hemisphere. In particular, the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices were underrepresented. Larger lesion size and areas associated with higher cortical function led to hospital admission. Conclusions Cortical brain infarcts in hospitalized patients are not dispersed equally but are predominantly located in brain structures associated with motor control and sensory and language function. Matching underrepresented cerebral cortex regions to symptoms not yet associated with stroke warrants further exploration.

Even though magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable tool, a histopathological diagnosis is often required because of imaging overlap between tumor recurrence and treatment associated changes. We set out to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions in magnetic resonance imaging scans of treated glioblastoma patients to investigate if ADC values could accurately differentiate between tumor progression, radiation-related changes, and ischemic infarctions.MethodsWe evaluated ADC values among 3 groups, patients with tumor progression, radiation necrosis, and ischemic infarctions. The regions of interest were placed in the areas of greatest hypointensity among solid lesions using the ADC maps, excluding areas with necrotic, cystic, or hemorrhagic changes. The ADC values of the contralateral normal appearing white matter were also measured as the reference value for each patient. The relative ADC (rADC) values were measured for all 3 groups. Comparison between lesions and normal white matter was evaluated by Wilcoxon signed test.ResultsA total of 157 patients were included in the study; 49 patients classified as tumor progression, 58 patients as radiation necrosis, and 50 patients as ischemic infarctions. The mean +/- SD ADC value was 752.8 +/- 132.5 for tumor progression, 479.0 +/- 105.2 for radiation-related changes, and 250.1 +/- 57.2 for ischemic infarctions. The mean +/- SD rADC value was 1.07 +/- 0.22 for tumor progression, 0.66 +/- 0.14 for radiation necrosis, and 0.34 +/- 0.08 for ischemic infarctions. The mean rADC values were significantly higher in tumor progression, compared with both radiation necrosis and ischemic changes (P < 0.001).ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates that ADC values are a helpful tool to differentiate between tumor progression, radiation necrosis, and posttreatment ischemic changes.

N2  -  Background Undersampling of gliomas at first biopsy is a major clinical problem, as accurate grading determines all subsequent treatment. We submit a technological solution to reduce the problem of undersampling by estimating a marker of tumor proliferation (Ki-67) using MR imaging data as inputs, against a stereotactic histopathology gold standard.
Methods MR imaging was performed with anatomic, diffusion, permeability, and perfusion sequences, in untreated glioma patients in a prospective clinical trial. Stereotactic biopsies were harvested from each patient immediately prior to surgical resection. For each biopsy, an imaging description (23 parameters) was developed, and the Ki-67 index was recorded. Machine learning models were built to estimate Ki-67 from imaging inputs, and cross validation was undertaken to determine the error in estimates. The best model was used to generate graphical maps of Ki-67 estimates across the whole brain.; Results Fifty-two image-guided biopsies were collected from 23 evaluable patients. The random forest algorithm best modeled Ki-67 with 4 imaging inputs (T2-weighted, fractional anisotropy, cerebral blood flow, K-trans). It predicted the Ki-67 expression levels with a root mean square (RMS) error of 3.5% (R-2 = 0.75). A less accurate predictive result (RMS error 5.4%, R-2 = 0.50) was found using conventional imaging only.; Conclusion Ki-67 can be predicted to clinically useful accuracies using clinical imaging data. Advanced imaging (diffusion, perfusion, and permeability) improves predictive accuracy over conventional imaging alone. Ki-67 predictions, displayed as graphical maps, could be used to guide biopsy, resection, andor radiation in the care of glioma patients.

N2  -  Background: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) mapping in research centers correlates well with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions and may accurately differentiate the infarct core from ischemic penumbra. The value of CTP in real-world clinical practice has not been fully established. We investigated the yield of CTP-derived cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transient time (MTT) for the detection of cerebral ischemia and ischemic penumbra in a sample of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Methods: We studied 165 patients with initial clinical symptoms suggestive of AIS. All patients had an initial noncontrast head CT, CTP, CT angiogram (CTA), and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The obtained perfusion images were used for image processing. CBV, MTT, and DWI lesion volumes were visually estimated and manually traced. Statistical analysis was conducted using R and SAS software. Results: All normal DWI sequences had normal CBV and MTT studies (N = 89). Seventy-three patients had acute DWI lesions. CBV was abnormal in 23.3% andMTTwas abnormal in 42.5% of these patients. There was a high specificity (91.8%) but poor sensitivity (40.0%) for MTT maps predicting positive DWI. The Spearman correlation was significant between MTT and DWI lesions (rho = 0.66; P > .0001) only for abnormal MTT and DWI lesions >0 cc. CBV lesions did not correlate with final DWI. Conclusions: In real-world use, acute imaging with CTP did not predict stroke or DWI lesions with sufficient accuracy. Our findings argue against the use of CTP for screening AIS patients until real-world implementations match the accuracy reported from specialized research centers.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The brainstem comprises a large variety of fiber tracts and nerve nuclei and is unarguably one of the most crucial parts of the brain. Reliable noninvasive visualization of its anatomy may help relate normal and pathological anatomic variations to neurologic/psychiatric disorders. In this study, we explored the potential of direction-encoded track-density imaging (TDI) for depicting the intricate anatomy of the brainstem.
METHODS: A total of 18 healthy volunteers (10 females, 8 males; median age, 34.5 years; interquartile range, 31-44.5 years) were examined on a 3-T MRI system. Diffusion tensor imaging data were processed using MRtrix to generate TDI images. These images were then compared with anatomic atlases to identify nerve nuclei and fiber tracts. The ability of TDI to delineate anatomic structures in the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata was evaluated using a 6-point Likert scale (5, excellent; 4, good; 3, moderate; 2, poor; 1, no adequate differentiation; 0, evaluation not possible).; RESULTS: All generated TDI images were evaluable without limitations. In the mesencephalon, delineation of the substantia nigra, crus cerebri, and red nucleus was rated as excellent, that of the medial lemniscus was rated as good, and that of the inferior colliculus was rated as poor. Delineation of all anatomic structures in the pons was rated as excellent. In the medulla oblongata, delineation of the pyramid was rated as excellent and that of the medial lemniscus as moderate, whereas delineation of the inferior olive was not possible.; CONCLUSIONS: TDI images provide optimal delineation of nerve nuclei and fibers in the upper brainstem, but have more difficulty identifying more caudal structures.

N2  -  Objective: Stereotactic biopsies are subject to sampling errors (essentially due to target selection). The presence of contrast enhancement is not a reliable marker of malignancy. The goal of the present study was to determine whether perfusion-weighted imaging can improve target selection in stereotactic biopsies. Methods: We studied 21 consecutive stereotactic biopsies between June 2009 and March 2010. Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was integrated into our neuronavigator. Perfusion-weighted imaging was used as an adjunct to conventional MRI data for target determination. Conventional MRI alone was used to determine the trajectory. Results: We found a linear correlation between regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and vessel density (number of vessels per mm 2; R = 0.64; p < 0.001). Perfusion-weighted imaging facilitated target determination in 11 cases (52.4%), all of which were histopathologically diagnosed as glial tumors. For glial tumors, which presented with contrast enhancement, perfusion-weighted imaging identified a more precisely delimited target in 9 cases, a different target in 1 case, and exactly the same target in 1 other case. In all cases, perfusion-selected sampling provided information on cellular features and tumor grading. rCBV was significantly associated with grading (p < 0.01), endothelial proliferation (p < 0.01), and vessel density (p < 0.01). For lesions with rCBV values <= 1, perfusion-weighted MRI did not help to determine the target but was useful for surgical management. Conclusions: For stereotactic biopsies, targeting based on perfusion-weighted imaging is a feasible method for reducing the sampling error and improving target selection in the histopathological diagnosis of tumors with high rCBVs.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is increasingly being used for mapping of various brain functions and in nTMS-based tractography in neurosurgical departments worldwide. When a department begins using nTMS data in the clinical workflow, smooth integration into the hospital's existing infrastructure is mandatory. Standardized approaches for this beyond the mapping or tractography procedures themselves have not yet been described.
METHODS: To create an effective workflow for neurosurgical nTMS mapping, we present the findings of our 7 years of experience and progressive integration into the clinical routine.; RESULTS: After indication for mapping is made, the workflow starts with patient admission and includes all preoperative steps until tumor resection. Importantly, only standard software and devices were used, enabling new centers to easily integrate data derived from nTMS mapping and nTMS-based tractography into their hospital's infrastructure. Registration of the patient, appointment planning, and documentation of results of the nTMS procedures within the hospital information system (HIS) can be achieved by a novel tailored software mask. As another important part of the workflow, nTMS data are imported into the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) via PACS integrator software. In addition, for surgical planning including nTMS-based tractography, nTMS data can be effectively included in surgical neuronavigation software.; CONCLUSIONS: Optimized integration of nTMS data can be achieved using a standardized workflow. The seamless integration and availability of nTMS data are crucial to the acceptance of these data in the clinical routine. This optimized workflow can serve as a guide for centers beginning to use nTMS data in patient care.

N2  -  Objective
To compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in lymph node metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with standardized uptake values (SUV) derived from combined 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomographymagnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG PETMRI).; Material and Methods; 38 patients with histopathologically proven NSCLC (mean age 60.1 +- 9.5y) received wholebody PETCT (Siemens mCT (TM)) 60min after injection of a mean dose of 280 +- 50 MBq 18F-FDG and subsequent PETMRI (mean time after tracer injection: 139 +- 26 min, Siemens Biograph mMR). During PET acquisition, simultaneous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI, b values: 0, 500, 1000 smm(2)) was performed. A maximum of 10 lymph nodes per patient suspicious for malignancy were analyzed. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn covering the entire lymph node on the attenuation-corrected PET-image and the monoexponential ADC-map. According to histopathology or radiological follow-up, lymph nodes were classified as benign or malignant. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for all lymph node metastases correlating SUVmax and SUVmean with ADC(mean).; Results; A total of 146 suspicious lymph nodes were found in 25 patients. One hundred lymph nodes were eligible for final analysis. Ninety-one lymph nodes were classified as malignant and 9 as benign according to the reference standard. In malignant lesions, mean SUVmax was 9.1 +- 3.8 and mean SUVmean was 6.0 +- 2.5 while mean ADC(mean) was 877.0 +- 128.6 x 10(-5) mm(2)s in PETMRI. For all malignant lymph nodes, a weak, inverse correlation between SUVmax and ADCmean as well as SUVmean and ADCmean (r = -0.30, p<0.05 and r = -0.36, p<0.05) existed.; Conclusion; The present data show a weak inverse correlation between increased glucose-metabolism and cellularity in lymph node metastases of NSCLC patients. 18F-FDG-PET and DWI thus may offer complementary information for the evaluation of treatment response in lymph node metastases of NSCLC.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Differentiation of acute and subacute isehemic stroke lesions from acute demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) may not be possible on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both lesion types enhance on T1 with gadolinium (Gd) contrast and both are hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). This study is an analysis of two quantitative MR indices: (1) calculated apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and (2) T2 relaxation times (T2R) as means toward differentiating acute ischemic lesions from acute demyelinating lesions. Chronic ischemic and demyelinating lesions were evaluated for comparison as well.
Methods: The MRI of nine patients with both acute and chronic ischemic lesions and six patients with both acute and chronic demyelinating lesions were analyzed for ADC and T2Rs. The indices were measured by manually placing regions of interest (ROIs) at the anatomic center of the acute lesion. Acute ischemic lesions were chosen by their hyperintensity on DWI and hypointensity on ADC mapping. Acute demyelinating lesions were selected by peripheral contrast enhancement after the administration of Gd. Computation of the ADC involved the diffusion coefficient on a region by region basis as follows: D = -(b(0)b(1000))In(S-b1000S-b0), where S-b1000 is the signal intensity on DWI and S-b0 is the signal intensity on T2 with diffusion sensitivities of b(0) and b(1000), respectively. Computation of the T2R was made as follows: T2R = (TET2 - TEPD)%(ln SIPD - In SIT2), where TE is the echo time of the different pulse sequences, SI is signal intensity on the different echo sequences, and PD represents proton density sequence.; Results: Twenty-nine acute ischemia, 27 acute demyelination, 28 chronic ischemia, and 43 chronic demyelination image sets were analyzed. The differences between ADC(acute) (infarct)(0.760) versus ADC(acute plaque) (1.106) were significant (p < 0.02). The differences between T2R(acute infarct)(235.5) versus T2R(acute) (plaque) (170.5) were also significant (p < 0.02).; Conclusions: ADC in combination with T2R is a useful tool to differentiate acute ischemic from acute demyelinating lesions. The use of these neuroimaging indices along with magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite ratios is then demonstrated in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism for a case of delayed posttraumatic bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

N2  -  Purpose: To show that measurement of the transverse relaxation time that characterizes signal loss caused by local susceptibilities (T2') is sensitive to an increased deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the brain, indicating tissue at risk for infarction.
Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the local institutional review board; patients or their guardians provided informed consent. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed within 6 hours of symptom onset and again 1-11 days thereafter in 100 consecutive stroke patients, all of whom received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (mean age, 67 years). The MR imaging protocol included diffusion-and perfusion-weighted imaging for determination of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and time to peak (TTP), along with quantitative T2 and T2* imaging. T2' maps were calculated and visually compared with ADC and TTP lesions by two independent observers.; Results: A T2' > ADC mismatch was observed by reader 1 in 73 (73%) of 100 patients, and by reader 2 in 65 (65%) patients. Respective sensitivities of T2' > ADC and of TTP > ADC mismatches for later infarct growth were 0.87 and 0.98 for reader 1 and 0.78 and 0.98 for reader 2, with respective specificities of 0.42 and 0.04 for reader 1 and 0.46 and 0.04 for reader 2. The odds ratios for infarct growth in the presence of a T2' > ADC mismatch were 4.59 (reader 1 P = .002) and 3.10 (reader 2 P = .012), while the odds ratios for TTP > ADC mismatch were 2.22 (reader 1 P = .606) and 1.73 (reader 2 P > .999).; Conclusion: The presence of a T2' > ADC mismatch is a more specific predictor of infarct growth than is TTP > ADC mismatch and hence may be of clinical value in patient selection for acute stroke therapies in the future.

N2  -  Background and Purpose The Network Modification (NeMo) Tool uses a library of brain connectivity maps from normal subjects to quantify the amount of structural connectivity loss caused by focal brain lesions. We hypothesized that the Network Modification Tool could predict remote brain tissue loss caused by poststroke loss of connectivity.
Methods Baseline and follow-up MRIs (10.77.5 months apart) from 26 patients with acute ischemic stroke (age, 74.614.1 years, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 3.1 +- 3.1) were collected. Lesion masks derived from diffusion-weighted images were superimposed on the Network Modification Tool's connectivity maps, and regional structural connectivity losses were estimated via the Change in Connectivity (ChaCo) score (ie, the percentage of tracks connecting to a given region that pass through the lesion mask). ChaCo scores were correlated with subsequent atrophy.; Results Stroke lesions' size and location varied, but they were more frequent in the left hemisphere. ChaCo scores, generally higher in regions near stroke lesions, reflected this lateralization and heterogeneity. ChaCo scores were highest in the postcentral and precentral gyri, insula, middle cingulate, thalami, putamen, caudate nuclei, and pallidum. Moderate, significant partial correlations were found between baseline ChaCo scores and measures of subsequent tissue loss (r=0.43, P=4.6x10(-9); r=0.61, P=1.4x10(-18)), correcting for the time between scans.; Conclusions ChaCo scores varied, but the most affected regions included those with sensorimotor, perception, learning, and memory functions. Correlations between baseline ChaCo and subsequent tissue loss suggest that the Network Modification Tool could be used to identify regions most susceptible to remote degeneration from acute infarcts.

N2  -  Emerging noninvasive neuroimaging techniques allow for the morphometric analysis of patterns of gray and white matter degeneration in vivo, which may help explain and predict the occurrence of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. A single center prospective follow-up study (Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion tensor and Magnetic resonance imaging Cohort study (RUN DMC)) was performed involving 503 nondemented elderly individuals (50-85 years) with a history of symptomatic cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Age was associated with a global reduction in cortical thickness, and this relationship was strongest for ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, auditory cortex, Wernicke's area, superior temporal lobe, and primary visual cortex. Right and left hemispheres differed in the thickness of language-related areas. White matter (WM) lesions were generally negatively correlated with cortical thickness, primarily in individuals over the age of 60, with the notable exception of Brodmann areas 4 and 5, which were positively correlated in age groups 50-60 and 60-70, respectively. The observed pattern of age-related decline may explain problems in memory and executive functions, which are already well documented in individuals with SVD. The additional gray matter loss affecting visual and auditory cortex, and specifically the head region of primary motor cortex, may indicate morphological correlates of impaired sensory and motor functions. The paradoxical positive relationship between WM lesion volume and cortical thickness in some areas may reflect early compensatory hyper-trophy. This study raises a further interest in the mechanisms underlying cerebral gray and white matter degeneration in association with SVD, which will require further investigation with diffusion weighted and longitudinal MR studies.

N2  -  Multi-parametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (mqMRI) allows the characterization of multiple tis-sue properties non-invasively and has shown great potential to enhance the sensitivity of MRI measurements. However, real-time mqMRI during dynamic physiological processes or general motions remains challenging. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel mqMRI technique based on multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) imaging, termed MQMOLED, to enable mqMRI in a single shot. In the data acquisition of MQMOLED, multiple MR echo signals with different multi-parametric weightings and phase modulations are generated and acquired in the same k-space. The k-space data is Fourier transformed and fed into a well-trained neural network for the reconstruction of multi-parametric maps. We demonstrated the accuracy and repeatability of MQMOLED in simultaneous mapping apparent proton density (APD) and any two parameters among T-2 , T-2*, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in 130-170 ms. The abundant information delivered by the multiple overlapping-echo signals in MQMOLED makes the technique potentially robust to system imperfections, such as inhomogeneity of static magnetic field or radiofrequency field. Benefitting from the single-shot feature, MQMOLED exhibits a strong motion tolerance to the continuous movements of subjects. For the first time, it captured the synchronous changes of ADC, T-2 , and T-1-weighted APD in contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging on patients with brain tumors, providing additional information about vascular density to the hemodynamic parametric maps. We expect that MQMOLED would promote the development of mqMRI technology and greatly benefit the applications of mqMRI, including therapeutics and analysis of metabolic/functional processes.

N2  -  TUMORS AND OTHER structural lesions located with and adjacent to the cerebral cortex present certain challenges in terms of the overall management and design of surgical strategies. This comprehensive analysis attempts to define the current understanding, as well as surgical technique, including localization of tumors and neuro-physiological mapping to maximize extent of resection while minimizing morbidity. Finally, it remains to be seen whether or not stimulation mapping will be the most useful way to identify function within the cortex in the future. Another potential paradigm would be to actually record baseline oscillatory rhythms within the cortex and, following presentation of a given task, determine if those rhythms are disturbed enough to identify eloquent cortex as a means of functional localization. This would be a paradigm shift away from stimulation mapping, which currently deactivates the cortex, as opposed to identifying an activation function which identifies functional cortex.

N2  -  Selective neurodegeneration accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction characterizes neuro degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Thiamine deficiency (TD) in rats is a model for the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to selective neuronal loss caused by chronic oxidative deficits. Neurodegeneration in TD-rats develops over a period of 12 to 14 days and can be partially reversed by thiamine administration. The aim of this study was to characterize the in-vivo progression of neurodegeneration and the neuronal rescue processes in TD using T-2 magnetic resonance mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Each rat was scanned prior to TD induction (day 0), before the appearance of neurological symptoms (day 10), during the symptomatic stage (days 12 and 14) and during the recuperation period (days 31 and 87). Time-dependent lesions were revealed mainly in the thalamus and the inferior colliculi. Early decrease in the fractional anisotropy (FA) was found on day 10 in the inferior colliculi and to a lesser degree in the thalamus, while the earliest detectable changes in the T-2 parameter occurred only on day 12. FA values in the thalamus remained significantly low after thiamine restoration, suggesting irreversible disarrangement and replacement of neuronal structures. While T-2 values in the frontal cortex demonstrated no lesions, FA values significantly increased on days 14 and 31. An enlargement of the lateral ventricles was observed and persevered during the recovery period. This longitudinal MRI study demonstrated that in TD MRI can detect neurodegeneration and neuronal recovery. DTI is more sensitive than T-2 mapping in the early detection of TD lesions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a mature scanning technique. With high sensitivity in detecting cerebral infractions, it has become an essential part of the clinical evaluation of acute stroke. However, with the update in medical ideals and treatment, clinicians are now focusing on distinguishing between reversible and irreversible brain tissue damage rather than detecting ischaemic lesions alone.
OBJECTIVE: We supposed that Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) could classify heterogeneous DWI lesions, deepening the understanding of tissue injury. We systematically studied the different parameters of DKI in acute stroke patients in the literature.; METHODS: We collected 41 patients (26 male, 15 female), including different infarctions with acute cerebral infarction in different brain regions. Of all patients, 20 were single-infarction, while others were multi-infarctions. In this paper, we categorized acute cerebral infarction lesions into two types according to the parametric characteristics of both DKI and DWI. Type I means the DKI and DWI were matched, and Type II means the DKI and DWI were mismatched. Based on each parametric map, the region of interest (ROI) is outlined in each most severe lesion area (as large as possible in the center of the lesion). In the control group, ROIs of the same size are located in the corresponding regions of the contralateral hemisphere.; RESULTS: In both Type I and Type II, all parameters conform to a normal distribution. An independent sample T-test was used to compare the differences between each group. In Type I, we found the FA, MD, Da, Dr, MK and Ka values were statistically different (P < 0.05), while in Type II, only the MK and Ka values were statistically different (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSION: DKI, compared to DWI, can provide more imaging information about intracranial ischemic infarction, which can deepen the understanding of the mechanism of ischemic tissue damage. Our classification of the brain acute stroke lesions by DKI parameters and DWI may help us rediscover the real core of infraction.

N2  -  Background: Currently, there is no gold standard for diagnosing minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can non-invasively evaluate changes in brain volume and damage to brain function. Objectives: The current study aims to evaluate changes in cerebral blood flow and brain function as predictors of MHE using DWI. Patients and Methods: Participants from October 2016 to October 2021 were scanned using a 3.0T superconductive MR machine (Discovery MR750, GE Medical Systems). Intravoxel incoherent motion DWI (IVIM-DWI) images of 30 patients with MHE and 30 controls were analyzed in a retrospective case-control study. The parameters of mono-, bi-, and stretched exponential models of the regions of interest, delineated from cerebral perfusion pseudo-color maps, were measured. The significance of the differences in parameter values between the groups was assessed using an independent t-test. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyze the predictive efficiency of each parameter for MHE. Results: Compared to the control group, the distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) of the bilateral frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus in the MHE group was statistically different (P < 0.05). The pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) and DDC demonstrated good diagnostic efficacy for MHE. D* had the highest area under the curve (AUC) in the bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral cingulate gyrus, and left occipital lobe. In contrast, DDC had the highest AUC in the right occipital and bilateral temporal lobes. Condusion: Intravoxel incoherent motion DWI is an imaging method that can detect MHE. In addition, D* and DDC are better diagnostic parameters for screening MHE. Intravoxel incoherent motion DWI will be helpful in uncovering deeper intrinsic pathophysiological mechanisms and improving predictive efficiency.

N2  -  Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are a range of malformations of cortical development each with specific histopathological features. Conventional radiological assessment of standard structural MRI is useful for the localization of lesions but is unable to accurately predict the histopathological features. Quantitative MRI offers the possibility to probe tissue biophysical properties in vivo and may bridge the gap between radiological assessment and ex-vivo histology. This review will cover histological, genetic and radiological features of FCD following the ILAE classification and will explain how quantitative voxel-and surface-based techniques can characterise these features. We will provide an overview of the quantitative MRI measures available, their link with biophysical properties and finally the potential application of quantitative MRI to the problem of FCD subtyping. Future research linking quantitative MRI to FCD histological properties should improve clinical protocols, allow better characterisation of lesions in vivo and tailored surgical planning to the individual.

N2  -  We aim to study radiation induced white matter injury in a pre-clinical model using Diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI). Nineteen 12-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated to the right hemisphere using a linear accelerator. The dose distribution map was coregistered to the DTI map to generate the actual radiation dose to each white matter tract. Rats underwent longitudinal DTI scans at five time points from 4 to 48 weeks post-radiation with histological evaluations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the external capsule, fornix, cerebral peduncle, anterior commissure, optic tract and optic nerve was evaluated. Radiation dose was highest at the ipsilateral external capsule and fornix (29.4 +/- A 1.3 and 29.8 +/- A 1.1 Gy, respectively). Optic nerve received 50 % dose to the external capsule and other white matter tracts received 80 % dose. Significantly lower FA was firstly found in the ipsilateral external capsule at 4 weeks post-radiation and in the ipsilateral fornix at 40 weeks post-radiation compared to the contralateral side. Significantly lower FA was found in contralateral optic nerve compared to ipsilateral optic nerve at 48 weeks post-radiation despite ipsilateral optic nerves receiving higher radiation dose than contralateral optic nerve (p = 0.021). No differences were found in other white matter regions until 48 weeks. Histology indicated demyelination, axonal degeneration and coagulative necrosis in all injured white matter. DTI can serve as a promising tool for assessment of radiation induced white matter injury and regional radiosensitivity of white matter tracts.

N2  -  Voxelwise disconnection mapping is a novel approach to disclose lesion-symptom relationships for symptoms caused by white matter disconnection. It uses MRI-based fiber tracking in healthy subjects seeded from patient's focal brain lesions. Resulting individual disconnection maps can then be statistically associated with symptoms. Despite increasing use in the recent years, the validity of this approach remains to be investigated. In this study, we validated both, our own implementation and the implementation provided within BCBtoolkit. For technical validation, we used simulated symptoms based on overlap of 70 real stroke lesions with tracts from a white matter atlas. For clinical validation, paresis scores and lesions from 316 patients with stroke were used. We found that voxelwise disconnection mapping is technically valid and outperforms the standard voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach for symptoms caused by white matter disconnection. Supporting its clinical validity and utility, we were able to reproduce the known association between corticospinal tract damage and contralateral hemiparesis. In addition, we demonstrate that the validity can be substantially diminished by relatively minor methodological changes. Based on these results, we derive methodological recommendations for the future use of voxelwise disconnection mapping. Our study highlights the importance of validating novel methodological approaches in the rapidly evolving field of neuroimaging.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is a new diffusion MRI technique that has rarely been applied for glioma grading. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of NODDI in tumour parenchyma (TP) and peritumoural area (PT) for grading gliomas and detecting isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation status.
Methods: Forty-two patients (male: 23, female: 19, mean age: 44.5 y) were recruited and underwent whole brain NODDI examination. Intracellular volume fraction (icvf) and orientation dispersion index (ODI) maps were derived. Three ROIs were manually placed on TP and PT regions for each case. The corresponding average values of icvf and ODI were calculated, and their diagnostic efficiency was assessed.; Results: Tumours with high icvfTP (>= 0.306) and low icvf(PT) (<= 0.331) were more likely to be high-grade gliomas (HGGs), while lesions with low icvfTP (< 0.306) and high icvfPT (> 0.331) were prone to be low-grade gliomas (LGGs) (P < 0.001). A multivariate logistic regression model including patient age and icvf values in TP and PT regions most accurately predicted glioma grade (AUC = 0.92, P < 0.001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%, respectively. However, no significant differences were found in NODDI metrics for differentiating IDH-1 mutation status.; Conclusions: The quantitative NODDI metrics in the TP and PT regions are highly valuable for glioma grading. A multivariate logistic regression model using the patient age and the icvf values in TP and PT regions showed very high predictive power. However, the utility of NODDI metrics for detecting IDH-1 mutation status has not been fully explored, as a larger sample size may be necessary to uncover benefits.

N2  -  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Aside neuropathological lesions, abnormal neuronal activity and brain metabolism are part of the core symptoms of the disease. Activity-induced Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) has been proposed as a powerful approach to visualize evoked brain activity in rodents. Here, we evaluated the relevance of MEMRI in measuring neuronal (dys-) function in the APPxPS1 knocked-in (KI) mouse model of AD. Brain anomalies were firstly demonstrated in APPxPS1-Ki mice using cognitive testing (memory impairment) and histological mapping of immediate early gene products (decreased density of fos-positive neurons). Paradoxically, MEMRI analyses were not able to confirm the occurrence of neuronal hypoactivities in vivo. We then performed a neuropathological analysis that highlighted an abnormal increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in APPxPS1-Ki mice. We hypothesized that diffuse weakening of the BBB results in an uncontrolled diffusion of the MR contrast agent and a lack of correlation between manganese accumulation and neuronal activity. These results bring to light a limitation of the activity-induced MEMRI approach when applied to the APPxPS1-Ki mouse model as well as other mouse models harboring a compromised BBB.

N2  -  PurposeQuantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is influenced by iron as well as myelin, which makes interpretation of pathologic changes challenging. Concurrent acquisition of MR sequences that are sensitive to axonal/myelin integrity, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), may provide context for interpreting quantitative susceptibility (QS) signal. The purpose of our study was to investigate alterations in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using QSM in conjunction with DTI.MethodsTwenty relapsing-remitting MS patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited for this prospective study. QS, radial diffusivity (RD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and R2* maps within the whole brain as well as individual tracts were generated for comparison between NAWM and HC white matter (HCWM).ResultsMS lesions demonstrated significant differences in QS, FA, RD, and R2* compared to HCWM (p<0.03). These metrics did not show a significant difference between whole-brain NAWM and HCWM. Among NAWM tracts, the cingulate gyri demonstrated significantly decreased QS compared to HCWM (p=0.004). The forceps major showed significant differences in FA and RD without corresponding changes in QS (p<0.01).ConclusionWe found discordant changes in QSM and DTI metrics within the cingulate gyri and forceps major. This may potentially reflect the influence of paramagnetic substrates such as iron, which could be decreased along these NAWM tracts. Our results point to the potential role of QSM as a unique biomarker, although additional validation studies are needed.

N2  -  We sought to evaluate a three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain perfusion technique based on echo-shifting (PRESTO) for its performance in evaluation of acute stroke, Twenty-six patients were scanned within 6 hours after onset of hemispheric symptoms, and the results were compared with results of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), The signal-to-noise ratio of the images was 61 +/- 3 pre-contrast and 47 +/- 3 at the bolus peak. Brain coverage on perfusion parameter maps was 95% +/- 2% compared with that displayed on T2-weighted images. with only minor artifacts related to susceptibility at the skull base. Measured regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) reduction closely correlated to lesion size on initial DWI and to final clinical outcome (P = 0.006), consistent with results previously reported for 2D perfusion methods, Mismatches between DWI and perfusion imaging characterized the total extent of tissue at risk, and the contrast timing correlated with the amount of collateral circulation as shown on DSA. In conclusion, 3D imaging using the PRESTO technique permits high-quality perfusion imaging of the entire brain. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Qualitative radiologic MR imaging review affords limited differentiation among types of pediatric posterior fossa brain tumors and cannot detect histologic or molecular subtypes, which could help to stratify treatment. This study aimed to improve current posterior fossa discrimination of histologic tumor type by using support vector machine classifiers on quantitative MR imaging features.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included preoperative MRI in 40 children with posterior fossa tumors (17 medulloblastomas, 16 pilocytic astrocytomas, and 7 ependymomas). Shape, histogram, and textural features were computed from contrast-enhanced T2WI and T1WI and diffusivity (ADC) maps. Combinations of features were used to train tumor-type-specific classifiers for medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and ependymoma types in separation and as a joint posterior fossa classifier. A tumor-subtype classifier was also produced for classic medulloblastoma. The performance of different classifiers was assessed and compared by using randomly selected subsets of training and test data.; RESULTS: ADC histogram features (25th and 75th percentiles and skewness) yielded the best classification of tumor type (on average >95.8% of medulloblastomas, >96.9% of pilocytic astrocytomas, and >94.3% of ependymomas by using 8 training samples). The resulting joint posterior fossa classifier correctly assigned >91.4% of the posterior fossa tumors. For subtype classification, 89.4% of classic medulloblastomas were correctly classified on the basis of ADC texture features extracted from the Gray-Level Co-Occurence Matrix.; CONCLUSIONS: Support vector machine-based classifiers using ADC histogram features yielded very good discrimination among pediatric posterior fossa tumor types, and ADC textural features show promise for further subtype discrimination. These findings suggest an added diagnostic value of quantitative feature analysis of diffusion MR imaging in pediatric neuro-oncology.

N2  -  We aimed to link macro- and microstructure measures of brain white matter obtained from diffusion MRI with effective connectivity measures based on a propagation of cortico-cortical evoked potentials induced with intrasurgical direct electrical stimulation. For this, we compared streamline lengths and log-transformed ratios of streamlines computed from presurgical diffusion-weighted images, and the delays and amplitudes of N1 peaks recorded intrasurgically with electrocorticography electrodes in a pilot study of 9 brain tumor patients. Our results showed positive correlation between these two modalities in the vicinity of the stimulation sites (Pearson coefficient 0.54 +/- 0.13 for N1 delays, and 0.47 +/- 0.23 for N1 amplitudes), which could correspond to the neural propagation via U-fibers. In addition, we reached high sensitivities (0.78 +/- 0.07) and very high specificities (0.93 +/- 0.03) in a binary variant of our comparison. Finally, we used the structural connectivity measures to predict the effective connectivity using a multiple linear regression model, and showed a significant role of brain microstructure-related indices in this relation.

N2  -  Object. The object of this study was to describe the utility and safety of using a single probe for combined intraoperative navigation and subcortical mapping in an intraoperative MR (iMR) imaging environment during brain tumor resection.
Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed those patients who underwent resection in the iMR imaging environment, as well as functional electrophysiological monitoring with continuous motor evoked potential (MEP) and direct subcortical mapping combined with diffusion tensor imaging tractography.; Results. As a navigational tool the monopolar probe used was safe and accurate. Positive subcortical fiber MEPs were obtained in 10 (83%) of the 12 cases. In 10 patients in whom subcortical MEPs were recorded, the mean stimulus intensity was 10.4 +- 5.2 mA and the mean distance from the probe tip to the corticospinal tract (CST) was 7.4 +-. 4.5 mm. There was a trend toward worsening neurological deficits if the distance to the CST was short, and a small minimum stimulation threshold was recorded indicating close proximity of the CST to the resection margins. Gross-total resection (95%-100% tumor removal) was achieved in 11 cases (92%), whereas 1 patient (8%) had at least a 90% tumor resection. At the end of 3 months, 2 patients (17%) had persistent neurological deficits.; Conclusions. The monopolar probe can be safely implemented in an iMR imaging environment both for navigation and stimulation purposes during the resection of intrinsic brain tumors. In this study there was a trend toward worsening neurological deficits if the distance from the probe to the CST was short (<5 mm) indicating close proximity of the resection cavity to the CST. This technology can be used in the iMR imaging environment as a surgical adjunct to minimize adverse neurological outcomes. (DOI: 10.31712010.9.JNS10481)

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) with endovascular proximal flow blockage is deemed able to reduce the cerebral embolization observed during filter-protected CAS. We evaluated clinical outcome and intraoperative embolization rates, measured by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-IVIRI) and transcranial Doppler monitoring, in a series of patients undergoing CAS with proximal flow blockage.
METHODS: A series of 35 consecutive patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis >= 70% were included to undergo CAS with proximal flow blockage, obtained with the Mo.Ma system. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative DW-MRI in order to detect new ischemic lesions. Of the 35 patients, 31 (89%) underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring to record the microembolic signals (MES) produced during each procedure.; RESULTS: The MoMa system was successfully used in 34 patients (technical success: 97%). Intolerance to balloon occlusion was observed in 4 patients (12%), but never compromised the completion of the procedure. No deaths or neurological events occurred in the postoperative period. DW-MRI disclosed 74 new ischemic lesions in 8 patients (834, 23.5%). All lesions except one were ipsilateral to the treated carotid artery. MES were detected in all procedures, with a mean number of 33.2 +- 23.2 (range 3-103). In 20 procedures (2031, 65%), MES were detected also during flow blockage (mean: 9.1 +- 7; range 2-28).; CONCLUSION: While achieving good technical and clinical results, CAS with proximal flow blockage is still accompanied by a non-negligible cerebral embolization. The detection of MES during ICA flow blockage suggests the need for a better selection of patients.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. We used diffusion tensor MRI to redefine the size of multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty-six white matter (WM) plaques were identified in 20 patients with MS. Plaque FA was measured by placing regions of interest (ROIs) on plaques on diffusion tensor images. We compared FA values in identical mirror-image ROIs placed on normal-appearing WM in the contralateral hemisphere. This comparison showed a mean decrease in FA of 41% in plaques, serving as the threshold for outlining abnormal regions in normal-appearing WM surrounding plaques. ROIs were placed around each plaque and FA values were compared with those in the mirror-image ROIs. Combined areas of perilesional normal-appearing WM with 40% or more FA reduction plus plaque were compared with the areas of abnormality on T2-weighted images using a paired Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.; RESULTS. Mean plaque area was 60 mm(2) (range, 15-103 mm(2)), mean plaque FA was 0.251 (range, 0.133-0.436), and mean FA of contralateral normal-appearing WM was 0.429 (range, 0.204-0.712). Applying a threshold of 40% FA reduction, mean combined area of abnormal WM (including plaque seen on T2-weighted sequences) was 87 mm(2) (range, 30-251 mm(2)) or 145% of the mean plaque area that was seen on T2-weighted images (p < 0.001).; CONCLUSION. Using an operator-defined threshold of abnormal FA values based on plaque anisotropy characteristics, we saw a statistically significant increase in plaque size.

N2  -  The purpose of this paper is to describe the newly-established technique in the field of neurological surgery for fusion imaging of three-dimensional magnetic resonance image (3D-MRI) and/or three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) for brain tumor surgery. Combining neuronavigation technology and intraoperative MRI, this method remarkably demonstrates spatial relationships of neurovascular structures and/or skull base landmarks and is very useful for intraoperative evaluation of completed neurosurgical operations. Using the navigation system and intraoperative MRI during surgery, it is possible to resect the brain tumor maximally and preserve essential neurological functions. Furthermore, advanced multimodal neuroradiological images such as functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET) clearly demonstrate the dominant cortex including the speech center, primary motor gyrus, primary sensory gyrus, and support high-quality operation with less invasive surgery. In conclusion, multimodal neuroradiological images are very useful for invasive non-circumscribed brain tumors such as glioma and, in combination with such highly technological analyses, advanced neurosurgical procedures are possible.

N2  -  Background. Functional diffusion mapping (fDM) is a cancer imaging technique that uses voxel-wise changes in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) to evaluate response to treatment. Despite promising initial results, uncertainty in image registration remains the largest barrier to widespread clinical application. The current study introduces a probabilistic approach to fDM quantification to overcome some of these limitations.
Methods. A total of 143 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who were undergoing standard radiochemotherapy were enrolled in this retrospective study. Traditional and probabilistic fDMs were calculated using ADC maps acquired before and after therapy. Probabilistic fDMs were calculated by applying random, finite translational, and rotational perturbations to both pre-and posttherapy ADC maps, then repeating calculation of fDMs reflecting changes after treatment, resulting in probabilistic fDMs showing the voxel-wise probability of fDM classification. Probabilistic fDMs were then compared with traditional fDMs in their ability to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).; Results. Probabilistic fDMs applied to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiochemotherapy demonstrated shortened PFS and OS among patients with a large volume of tumor with decreasing ADC evaluated at the posttreatment time with respect to the baseline scans. Alternatively, patients with a large volume of tumor with increasing ADC evaluated at the posttreatment time with respect to baseline scans were more likely to progress later and live longer. Probabilistic fDMs performed better than traditional fDMs at predicting 12-month PFS and 24-month OS with use of receiver-operator characteristic analysis. Univariate log-rank analysis on Kaplan-Meier data also revealed that probabilistic fDMs could better separate patients on the basis of PFS and OS, compared with traditional fDMs.; Conclusions. Results suggest that probabilistic fDMs are a more predictive biomarker in terms of 12-month PFS and 24-month OS in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, compared with traditional fDM analysis.

N2  -  Background Conventional structural MRI fails to identify a cerebral lesion in 25% of patients with cryptogenic partial epilepsy (CPE). Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique sensitive to microstructural abnormalities of cerebral white matter (WM) by quantification of fractional anisotropy (FA). The objectives of the present study were to identify focal FA abnormalities in patients with CPE who were deemed MRI negative during routine presurgical evaluation.
Methods Diffusion tensor imaging at 3 T was performed in 12 patients with CPE and normal conventional MRI and in 67 age matched healthy volunteers. WM integrity was compared between groups on the basis of automated voxel-wise statistics of FA maps using an analysis of covariance. Volumetric measurements from high resolution T1-weighted images were also performed.; Results Significant FA reductions in WM regions encompassing diffuse areas of the brain were observed when all patients as a group were compared with controls. On an individual basis, voxel based analyses revealed widespread symmetrical FA reduction in CPE patients. Furthermore, asymmetrical temporal lobe FA reduction was consistently ipsilateral to the electroclinical focus. No significant correlations were found between FA alterations and clinical data. There were no differences in brain volumes of CPE patients compared with controls.; Conclusion Despite normal conventional MRI, WM integrity abnormalities in CPE patients extend far beyond the epileptogenic zone. Given that unilateral temporal lobe FA abnormalities were consistently observed ipsilateral to the seizure focus, analysis of temporal FA may provide an informative in vivo investigation into the localisation of the epileptogenic zone in MRI negative patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Gliomas adjacent to the corticospinal tract (CST) should be carefully resected to preserve motor function while achieving maximal surgical resection. Modern high -field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) enables precise visualization of the residual tumor and intraoperative tractography. We prospectively evaluated the extent of resection and distance between the tumor resection cavity and CST using 3-T iMRI combined with motor evoked potentials (MEP) in glioma surgery. - METHODS: Participants comprised patients who underwent surgery for solitary supratentorial glioma located within 10 mm of the CST. All cases underwent surgery using neuronavigation with overlaid CST under MEP monitoring. The correlation between distance from CST and transcortical MEP amplitude was calculated using Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Among the 63 patients who underwent surgery, 27 patients were enrolled in the study. Gross total resections were achieved in 26 of the 27 cases. Volumetric analysis showed the extent of resection was 98.6%. Motor function was stable or improved in 24 patients (Stable/ Improved group) and deteriorated in 3 patients (Deteriorated group). All patients in the Deteriorated group showed motor deficit before surgery. Mean intraoperative minimal distance was significantly longer in the Stable/Improved group (7.3 mm) than in the Deteriorated group (1.1 mm; P < 0.05). MEP amplitude correlated with minimal distance between the resection cavity and CST (R [ 0.64). - CONCLUSIONS: Resection of gliomas adjacent to CST with a navigation system using 3-T iMRI could result in an u ltimate EOR >98%. The combination of intraoperative tractography and MEP contributes to maximal removal of motor -eloquent gliomas.

N2  -  White matter changes occur endemically in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of elderly persons. MRI appearance and histopathological correlates of white matter changes are heterogeneous. Smooth periventricular hyperintensities, including caps around the ventricular horns, periventricular lining and halos are likely to be of non-vascular origin. They relate to a disruption of the ependymal lining with subependymal widening of the extracellular space and have to be differentiated from subcortical and deep white matter abnormalities. For the latter a distinction needs to be made between punctate, early confluent and confluent types. Although punctate white matter lesions often represent widened perivascular spaces without substantial ischemic tissue damage, early confluent and confluent lesions correspond to incomplete ischemic destruction. Punctate abnormalities on MRI show a low tendency for progression, while early confluent and confluent changes progress rapidly. The causative and modifying pathways involved in the occurrence of sporadic age-related white matter changes are still incompletely understood, but recent microarray and genome-wide association approaches increased the notion of pathways that might be considered as targets for therapeutic intervention. The majority of differentially regulated transcripts in white matter lesions encode genes associated with immune function, cell cycle, proteolysis, and ion transport. Genome-wide association studies identified six SNPs mapping to a locus on chromosome 17q25 to be related to white matter lesion load in the general population. We also report first and preliminary data that demonstrate apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity in white matter lesions and support epidemiological findings indicating that ApoE is another factor possibly related to white matter lesion occurrence. Further insights come from modern MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor and magnetization transfer imaging, as they provide tools for the characterization of normal-appearing brain tissue beyond what can be expected from standard MRI scans. There is a need for additional pre- and postmortem studies in humans, including these new imaging techniques.

T2  -  BRAIN AND LANGUAGE

N2  -  Brain imaging methods such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) have already been used to decipher the functional and structural brain changes occurring during normal language development. However, little is known about the differentiation of the language network after an early lesion. While in adults, stroke over the left hemisphere generally induces post-stroke aphasia, it is not always the case when a stroke occurs in the perinatal period, thus revealing a remarkable plastic power of the language network during early development. In particular, the role of perilesional tissues, as opposed to undamaged brain areas in the functional recovery of language functions after an early insult, remains unclear. In this review article, we provide an overview of the extant literature using functional and structural neuroimaging data revealing the signatures of brain plasticity underlying near-normal language development.

N2  -  Objective: The usefulness of neurosurgical navigation with current visualizations is seriously compromised by brain shift, which inevitably occurs during the course of the operation, significantly degrading the precise alignment between the pre-operative MR data and the intraoperative shape of the brain. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate the feasibilitv of non-rigid registration that compensates for the brain deformations within the time constraints imposed by neurosurgery, and (ii) to create augmented reality visualizations of critical structural and functional brain regions during neurosurgery using pre-operatively acquired fMRI and DT-MRI.
Materials and methods: Eleven consecutive patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in our study. All underwent surgery at our intraoperative MR imaging-guided therapy facility and have tumors in eloquent brain areas (e.g. precentral gyrus and cortico-spinal tract). Functional MRI and DT-MRI, together with MPRAGE and T2w structural MRI were acquired at 3 T prior to surgery. SPGR and T2w images were acquired with a 0.5 T magnet during each procedure. Quantitative assessment of the alignment accuracy was carried out and compared with current state-of-the-art systems based only on rigid registration.; Results: Alignment between pre-operative and intra-operative datasets was successfully carried out during surgery for all patients. Overall, the mean residual displacement remaining after non-rigid registration was 1.82 rum. There is a statistically significant improvement in alignment accuracy utilizing our non-rigid registration in comparison to the currently used technology (p < 0.001).; Conclusions: We were able to achieve intra-operative rigid and nonrigid registration of (1) pre-operative structural MRI with intraoperative T1w NMRI; (2) pre-operative fMRI with intra-operative T1w MRI, and (3) pre-operative DT-MRI with intra-operative T1w MRI. The registration algorithms as implemented were sufficiently robust and rapid to meet the hard real-time constraints of intra-operative surgical decision making. The validation experiments demonstrate that we can accurately compensate for the deformation of the brain and thus can construct an augmented reality visualization to aid the surgeon.

N2  -  Simple Summary To test the hypothesis that quantitative magnetic resonance relaxometry reflects glioma tumor load within tissue and that it can be an imaging surrogate for visualizing non-contrast-enhancing tumors, we investigated the correlation between T1- and T2-weighted relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on magnetic resonance imaging, and C-11-methionine (MET) on positron emission tomography (PET). Moreover, we compared T1- and T2-relaxation times and ADC with tumor cell density (TCD) findings obtained via stereotactic image-guided tissue sampling. A T1-relaxation time of >1850 ms but 115 ms but <225 ms under 3 T indicated high MET uptake. The stereotactic tissue sampling findings confirmed that the T1-relaxation time of 1850-3200 ms significantly indicated higher TCD while the T2-relaxation time and ADC did not significantly correlate with the stereotactic tissue sampling findings. However, synthetically synthesized tumor load images from the T1- and T2-relaxation maps were able to visualize MET uptake presented on PET. One of the most crucial yet challenging issues for glioma patient care is visualizing non-contrast-enhancing tumor regions. In this study, to test the hypothesis that quantitative magnetic resonance relaxometry reflects glioma tumor load within tissue and that it can be an imaging surrogate for visualizing non-contrast-enhancing tumors, we investigated the correlation between T1- and T2-weighted relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on magnetic resonance imaging, and C-11-methionine (MET) on positron emission tomography (PET). Moreover, we compared the T1- and T2-relaxation times and ADC with tumor cell density (TCD) findings obtained via stereotactic image-guided tissue sampling. Regions that presented a T1-relaxation time of >1850 ms but 115 ms but <225 ms under 3 T indicated a high MET uptake. In addition, the stereotactic tissue sampling findings confirmed that the T1-relaxation time of 1850-3200 ms significantly indicated a higher TCD (p = 0.04). However, ADC was unable to show a significant correlation with MET uptake or with TCD. Finally, synthetically synthesized tumor load images from the T1- and T2-relaxation maps were able to visualize MET uptake presented on PET.

T2  -  ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS

N2  -  The vast majority of malignant gliomas relapse after surgery and standard radio-chemotherapy. Novel molecular and cellular therapies are thus being developed, targeting specific aspects of tumor growth. While histopathology remains the gold standard for tumor classification, neuroimaging has over the years taken a central role in the diagnosis and treatment follow up of brain tumors. It is used to detect and localize lesions, define the target area for biopsies, plan surgical and radiation interventions and assess tumor progression and treatment outcome. In recent years the application of novel drugs including anti-angiogenic agents that affect the tumor vasculature, has drastically modulated the outcome of brain tumor imaging. To properly evaluate the effects of emerging experimental therapies and successfully support treatment decisions, neuroimaging will have to evolve. Multimodal imaging systems with existing and new contrast agents, molecular tracers, technological advances and advanced data analysis can all contribute to the establishment of disease relevant biomarkers that will improve disease management and patient care. In this review, we address the challenges of glioma imaging in the context of novel molecular and cellular therapies, and take a prospective look at emerging experimental and pre-clinical imaging techniques that bear the promise of meeting these challenges.

N2  -  We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI, and short echo time chemical shift imaging (CSI) for grading gliomas.
In this prospective study, 35 patients with cerebral gliomas underwent DKI, DSC, and CSI on a 3 T MR scanner. Diffusion parameters were mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis (MK). Perfusion parameters were mean relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV), mean relative regional cerebral blood flow (rrCBF), mean transit time, and relative decrease ratio (rDR). The diffusion and perfusion parameters along with 12 CSI metabolite ratios were compared among 22 high-grade gliomas and 14 low-grade gliomas (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < .05). Classification accuracy was determined with a linear discriminant analysis for each MR modality independently. Furthermore, the performance of a multimodal analysis is reported, using a decision-tree rule combining the statistically significant DKI, DSC-MRI, and CSI parameters with the lowest P-value. The proposed classifiers were validated on a set of subsequently acquired data from 19 clinical patients.; Statistically significant differences among tumor grades were shown for MK, MD, mean rrCBV, mean rrCBF, rDR, lipids over total choline, lipids over creatine, sum of myo-inositol, and sum of creatine. DSC-MRI proved to be the modality with the best performance when comparing modalities individually, while the multimodal decision tree proved to be most accurate in predicting tumor grade, with a performance of 86%.; Combining information from DKI, DSC-MRI, and CSI increases diagnostic accuracy to differentiate low- from high-grade gliomas, possibly providing diagnosis for the individual patient.

N2  -  Background. - Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) are aggressive brain tumours, previously known as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), with 10% overall survival (OS) at 18 months. Predicting OS will help refine treatment strategy in this patient group. MRI based texture analysis (MRTA) is novel image analysis technique that provides objective information about spatial arrangement of MRI signal intensity (heterogeneity) and has potential to be imaging biomarker.
Objectives. - To investigate MRTA in predicting OS in childhood DMG.; Methods. - Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with DMG, based on radiological features, treated at our institution 2007-2017. MRIs were acquired at diagnosis and 6 weeks after radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions). MRTA was performed using commercial available TexRAD research software on T2 W sequence and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps encapsulating tumour in the largest single axial plane. MRTA comprised filtration-histogram technique using statistical and histogram metrics for quantification of texture. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis determined association of MRI texture parameters with OS.; Results. - In all, 32 children 2-14 years (median 7 years) were included. MRTA was undertaken on T2W (n = 32) and ADC (n = 22). T2W-MRTA parameters were better at prognosticating than ADC-MRTA. Children with homogenous tumour texture, at medium scale on diagnostic T2W MRI, had worse prognosis (Mean of Positive Pixels (MPP): A=0.005, mean: A=0.009, SD: A=0.011, kurtosis: A=0.037, entropy: A=0.042). Best predictor MPP was able to stratify patients into poor and good prognostic groups with median survival of 7.5 months versus 17.5 months, respectively.; Conclusions. - DMG with more homogeneous texture on diagnostic MRI is associated with worse prognosis. Texture parameter MPP is the most predictive marker of OS in childhood DMG. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  -  Background. Assessment of treatment response by measuring tumor size is known to be a late and potentially confounded response index. Serial diffusion MRI has shown potential for allowing earlier and possibly more reliable response assessment in adult patients, with limited experience in clinical settings and in pediatric brain cancer. We present a retrospective study of clinical MRI data in children with high-grade brain tumors to assess and compare the values of several diffusion change metrics to predict treatment response.
Methods. Eighteen patients (age range, 1.9-20.6 years) with high-grade brain tumors and serial diffusion MRI (pre- and posttreatment interval range, 1-16 weeks posttreatment) were identified after obtaining parental consent. The following diffusion change metrics were compared with the clinical response status assessed at 6 months: (1) regional change in absolute and normalized apparent diffusivity coefficient (ADC), (2) voxel-based fractional volume of increased (fiADC) and decreased ADC (fdADC), and (3) a new metric based on the slope of the first principal component of functional diffusion maps (fDM).; Results. Responders (n = 12) differed significantly from nonresponders (n = 6) in all 3 diffusional change metrics demonstrating higher regional ADC increase, larger fiADC, and steeper slopes (P < .05). The slope method allowed the best response prediction (P < .01, eta(2) = 0.78) with a classification accuracy of 83% for a slope of 58 degrees using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.; Conclusions. We demonstrate that diffusion change metrics are suitable response predictors for high-grade pediatric tumors, even in the presence of variable clinical diffusion imaging protocols.

N2  -  BackgroundMRI is the imaging modality of choice in detecting and evaluating spinal lesions. However, advanced techniques as diffusion and perfusion studies can help more in differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Our study aimed to detect the role of diffusion and T2* perfusion weighted imaging in characterization of different spinal lesions by measuring the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient value (ADC) of all lesions, comparing perfusion of lesion in relation to normal cord and detection of diffusion pattern of each lesion by observing its signal intensity at diffusion images and ADC map.ResultsFifty patients were included in this study. Twenty-five patients were with non-neoplastic lesions and twenty-five patients were with neoplastic lesions. The cutoff value of rCBV was 1.2 in differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions with 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The cutoff value of ADC was 1 in differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions with 56% sensitivity and 80% specificity.ConclusionsDiffusion and perfusion weighted images help in differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic spinal lesions.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To determine whether the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions surrounding and remote from multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques have abnormal diffusional anisotropy and to compare anisotropy maps with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for sensitivity in the detection of white matter (WM) abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were performed in 26 patients with MS and in 26 age-matched control subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and ADC maps were generated and coregistered with T2-weighted MR images. Uniform regions of interest were placed on plaques, periplaque white matter (PWM) regions, NAWM regions in the contralateral side of the brain, and WM regions in control subjects to obtain FA and ADC values, which were compared across the WM regions.; RESULTS: The mean FA was 0.280 for plaques, 0.383 for PWM, 0.493 for NAWM, and 0.537 for control subject WM. The mean ADC was 1.025 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec for plaques, 0.786 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec for PWM, 0.739 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec for NAWM, and 0.726 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec for control subject WM. Significant differences in anisotropy and ADC values were observed among all WM regions (P < .001 for all comparisons, except ADC in NAWM vs control subject WM P = .018).; CONCLUSION: The anisotropy and ADC values were abnormal in all WM regions in the patients with MS and were worse in the periplaque regions than in the distant regions. Diffusion tensor MR imaging may be more accurate than T2-weighted MR imaging for assessment of disease burden. (C) RSNA, 2002.

N2  -  Presenting quantitative data using non-standardized color maps potentially results in unrecognized misinterpretation of data. Clinically meaningful color maps should intuitively and inclusively represent data without misleading interpretation. Uniformity of the color gradient for color maps is critically important. Maximal color and lightness contrast, readability for color vision-impaired individuals, and recognizability of the color scheme are highly desirable features. This article describes the use of color maps in five key quantitative MRI techniques: relaxometry, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, MR elastography (MRE), and water-fat MRI. Current display practice of color maps is reviewed and shortcomings against desirable features are highlighted.

N2  -  BackgroundThe identification of viable tumors and radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is crucial for patient management. Tumor habitat analysis involving the grouping of similar voxels can identify subregions that share common biology and enable the depiction of areas of tumor recurrence and treatment-induced change. This study aims to validate an imaging biomarker for tumor recurrence after SRS for brain metastasis by conducting tumor habitat analysis using multi-parametric MRI.MethodsIn this prospective study (NCT05868928), patients with brain metastases will undergo multi-parametric MRI before SRS, and then follow-up MRIs will be conducted every 3 months until 24 months after SRS. The multi-parametric MRI protocol will include T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging. Using k-means voxel-wise clustering, this study will define three structural MRI habitats (enhancing, solid low-enhancing, and nonviable) on T1- and T2-weighted images and three physiologic MRI habitats (hypervascular cellular, hypovascular cellular, and nonviable) on apparent diffusion coefficient maps and cerebral blood volume maps. Using RANO-BM criteria as the reference standard, via Cox proportional hazards analysis, the study will prospectively evaluate associations between parameters of the tumor habitats and the time to recurrence. The DICE similarity coefficients between the recurrence site and tumor habitats will be calculated.DiscussionThe tumor habitat analysis will provide an objective and reliable measure for assessing tumor recurrence from brain metastasis following SRS. By identifying subregions for local recurrence, our study could guide the next therapeutic targets for patients after SRS.Trial registrationThis study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05868928).

N2  -  A recent MRI method, fast macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping, was used to quantify demyelination in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat stroke model. MPF and other quantitative MRI parameters (T-1, T-2, proton density, and apparent diffusion coefficient) were compared with histological and immunohistochemical markers of demyelination (Luxol Fast Blue stain, (LFB)), neuronal loss (NeuN immunofluorescence), axonal loss (Bielschowsky stain), and inflammation (Iba1 immunofluorescence) in three animal groups (n=5 per group) on the 1st, 3rd, and 10th day after MCAO. MPF and LFB optical density (OD) were significantly reduced in the ischemic lesion on all days after MCAO relative to the symmetrical regions of the contralateral hemisphere. Percentage changes in MPF and LFB OD in the ischemic lesion relative to the contralateral hemisphere significantly differed on the first day only. Percentage changes in LFB OD and MPF were strongly correlated (R=0.81, P<0.001) and did not correlate with other MRI parameters. MPF also did not correlate with other histological variables. Addition of T-2 into multivariate regression further improved agreement between MPF and LFB OD (R=0.89, P<0.001) due to correction of the edema effect. This study provides histological validation of MPF as an imaging biomarker of demyelination in ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Background. Recent conflicting reports have found both brain tumor hypercellularity and necrosis in regions of restricted diffusion on MRI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images. This study precisely compares ADC and cell density voxel by voxel using postmortem human whole brain samples.
Methods. Patients with meningioma were evaluated to determine a normative ADC distribution within benign fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2hyperintensity surrounding tumor. This distribution was used to calculate a minimum ADC threshold to define regions of ADC-FLAIR mismatch (AFMM), where restricted diffusion presented in conjunction with T2FLAIR hyperintensity. Contrast-enhancing voxels were excluded from this analysis. AFMM maps were generated using imaging acquired prior to death in 7 patients with high-grade glioma who eventually donated their brains upon death. Histological samples were taken from numerous regions of abnormal FLAIR and AFMM. Each sample was computationally processed to determine cell density. Custom software was then used to downsample coregistered microscopic histology to the more coarse MRI resolution. A voxel-by-voxel evaluation comparing ADC and cellularity was then performed.; Results. An ADC threshold of 0.929x10(-3) mm(2)s was calculated from meningioma-induced edema and was used to define AFMM. Regions of AFMM showed significantly greater cell density in 6 of 7 high-grade glioma cases compared with regions of hyperintense FLAIR alone (P < .0001). Two patients had small regions of diffusion-restricted necrosis that had significantly lower ADC than nearby hypercellularity.; Conclusions. Regions of AFMM contain hypercellularity except for regions with extremely restricted diffusion, where necrosis is present.

N2  -  Central nervous system involvement related to decompression sickness (DCS) is a very rare complication of breath-hold diving. So far, it has been postulated that repeated dives with short surface intervals represent a key factor in the development of breath-holding-related DCS. We report the case of a breath-hold diver who, after repeated immersion, developed DCS with brain involvement. After treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, there was a clinical improvement in the symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hyperintense lesions in long-time repetition sequences (FLAIR, T2WI) in the left frontal and right temporal lobes. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map were characteristic of vasogenic edema, allowing us to exclude the ischemic nature of the process. These findings, together with the acute clinical presentation, the resolution of lesions in evolutionary radiological controls and the possible involvement of blood-brain barrier/endothelial dysfunction in DCS, could suggest a new form of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)-like presentation of DCS. This would represent a novel mechanism to explain the pathophysiology of this entity. We conducted a literature review, analyzing the pathophysiological and neuroimaging characteristics of DCS in breath-hold diving based on a case of this rare disease.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to localize major white matter tracts within the human brain. For surgery of tumors near eloquent brain areas such as the pyramidal tract this information is of importance to achieve an optimal resection while avoiding post-operative neurological deficits. However, due to the small bandwidth of echo planar imaging, diffusion tensor images suffer from susceptibility artifacts resulting in positional shifts and distortion. As a consequence, the fiber tracts computed from echo planar imaging data are spatially distorted. We present an approach based on non-linear registration using Bezier functions to efficiently correct distortions due to susceptibility artifacts. The approach makes extensive use of graphics hardware to accelerate the non-linear registration procedure. An improvement presented in this paper is a more robust and efficient optimization strategy based on simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA).
Since the accuracy of non-linear registration is crucial for the value of the presented correction method, two techniques were applied in order to prove the quality of the proposed framework. First, the registration accuracy was evaluated by recovering a known transformation with non-linear registration. Second, landmark-based evaluation of the registration method for anatomical and diffusion tensor data was performed. The registration was then applied to patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tract in order to compensate for susceptibility artifacts. The effect of the correction on the pyramidal tract was then quantified by measuring the position of the tract before and after registration. As a result, the distortions observed in phase encoding direction were most prominent at the cortex and the brainstem. The presented approach allows correcting fiber tract distortions which is an important prerequisite when tractography data are integrated into a stereotactic setup for intra-operative guidance.

N2  -  Advanced imaging provides insight into biophysical, physiologic, metabolic, or functional properties of tissues. Because water mobility is sensitive to cellular homeostasis, cellular density, and microstructural organization, it is considered a valuable tool in the advanced imaging arsenal. This article summarizes diffusion imaging concepts and highlights clinical applications of diffusion MR imaging for oncologic imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging and its derivative maps of diffusion anisotropy allow assessment of tumor compression or destruction of adjacent normal tissue anisotropy and may aid to assess tumor infiltration and aid presurgical planning.

N2  -  Iron-mediated toxicity is a key factor causing brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study was performed to investigate the noninvasive neuroimaging method for quantifying brain iron content using a minipig ICH model and assess the effects of minocycline treatment on ICH-induced iron overload and brain injury. The minipig ICH model was established by injecting 2 ml of autologous blood into the right basal ganglia, which were then subjected to the treatments of minocycline and vehicle. Furthermore, the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to quantify iron content, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to evaluate white matter tract. Additionally, we also performed immunohistochemistry, Western blot, iron assay, Perl's staining, brain water content, and neurological score to evaluate the iron overload and brain injury. Interestingly, we found that the ICH-induced iron overload could be accurately quantified by the QSM. Moreover, the minocycline was quite beneficial for protecting brain injury by reducing the lesion volume and brain edema, preventing brain iron accumulation, downsizing ventricle enlargement, and alleviating white matter injury and neurological deficits. In summary, we suggest that the QSM be an accurate and noninvasive method for quantifying brain iron level, and the minocycline may be a promising therapeutic agent for patients with ICH.

N2  -  Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is considered primarily a disease of grey matter, although the extent of white matter involvement has not been well described. We used diffusion tensor imaging to study the white matter in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease compared to healthy control subjects and to correlated magnetic resonance imaging findings with histopathology. Twenty-six patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and nine age-and gender-matched healthy control subjects underwent volumetric T-1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. Six patients had post-mortem brain analysis available for assessment of neuropathological findings associated with prion disease. Parcellation of the subcortical white matter was performed on 3D T-1-weighted volumes using Freesurfer. Diffusion tensor imaging maps were calculated and transformed to the 3D-T-1 space; the average value for each diffusion metric was calculated in the total white matter and in regional volumes of interest. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was also performed to investigate the deeper white matter tracts. There was a significant reduction of mean (P = 0.002), axial (P = 0.0003) and radial (P = 0.0134) diffusivities in the total white matter in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Mean diffusivity was significantly lower in most white matter volumes of interest (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), with a generally symmetric pattern of involvement in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Mean diffusivity reduction reflected concomitant decrease of both axial and radial diffusivity, without appreciable changes in white matter anisotropy. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed significant reductions of mean diffusivity within the white matter of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, mainly in the left hemisphere, with a strong trend (P = 0.06) towards reduced mean diffusivity in most of the white matter bilaterally. In contrast, by visual assessment there was no white matter abnormality either on T-2-weighted or diffusion-weighted images. Widespread reduction in white matter mean diffusivity, however, was apparent visibly on the quantitative attenuation coefficient maps compared to healthy control subjects. Neuropathological analysis showed diffuse astrocytic gliosis and activated microglia in the white matter, rare prion deposition and subtle subcortical microvacuolization, and patchy foci of demyelination with no evident white matter axonal degeneration. Decreased mean diffusivity on attenuation coefficient maps might be associated with astrocytic gliosis. We show for the first time significant global reduced mean diffusivity within the white matter in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, suggesting possible primary involvement of the white matter, rather than changes secondary to neuronal degeneration/loss.

N2  -  This study incorporated topology Betti number (BN) features into the prediction of primary sites of brain metastases and the construction of magnetic resonance-based imaging biopsy (MRB) models. The significant features of the MRB model were selected from those obtained from gray-scale and three-dimensional wavelet-filtered images, BN and inverted BN (iBN) maps, and clinical variables (age and gender). The primary sites were predicted as either lung cancer or other cancers using MRB models, which were built using seven machine learning methods with significant features chosen by three feature selection methods followed by a combination strategy. Our study dealt with a dataset with relatively smaller brain metastases, which included effective diameters greater than 2 mm, with metastases ranging from 2 to 9 mm accounting for 17% of the dataset. The MRB models were trained by T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images of 494 metastases chosen from 247 patients and applied to 115 metastases from 62 test patients. The most feasible model attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.763 for the test patients when using a signature including features of BN and iBN maps, gray-scale and wavelet-filtered images, and clinical variables. The AUCs of the model were 0.744 for non-small cell lung cancer and 0.861 for small cell lung cancer. The results suggest that the BN signature boosted the performance of MRB for the identification of primary sites of brain metastases including small tumors.

N2  -  Objectives The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare optimized respiratory-triggered diffusion-weighted imaging with simultaneous multislice acceleration (SMS-RT-DWI) of the liver with a standard free-breathing echo-planar DWI (s-DWI) protocol at 3 T with respect to the imaging artifacts inherent to DWI. Materials and Methods Fifty-two patients who underwent a magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver were included in this retrospective study. Examinations were performed on a 3 T whole-body magnetic resonance system (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). In all patients, both s-DWI and SMS-RT-DWI of the liver were obtained. Images were qualitatively evaluated by 2 independent radiologists with regard to overall image quality, liver edge sharpness, sequence-related artifacts, and overall scan preference. For quantitative evaluation, signal-to-noise ratio was measured from signal-to-noise ratio maps. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured in each liver quadrant. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for analysis of the qualitative parameters and the paired Student t test for quantitative parameters. Results Overall image quality, liver edge sharpness, and sequence-related artifacts of SMS-RT-DWI received significantly better ratings compared with s-DWI (P < 0.05 for all). For 90.4% of the examinations, both readers overall preferred SMS-RT-DWI to s-DWI. Acquisition time for SMS-RT-DWI was 34% faster than s-DWI. Signal-to-noise ratio values were significantly higher for s-DWI at b50 but did not statistically differ at b800, and they were more homogenous for SMS-RT-DWI, with a significantly lower standard deviation at b50. Mean ADC values decreased from the left to right hepatic lobe as well as from cranial to caudal for s-DWI. With SMS-RT-DWI, mean ADC values were homogeneous throughout the liver. Conclusions Optimized, multislice, respiratory-triggered DWI of the liver at 3 T substantially improves image quality with a reduced scan acquisition time compared with s-DWI.

N2  -  To apply an easy-to-assemble phantom substitute for human prostates in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
Kiwi fruit were fixed with gel hot and cold compress packs on two plastic nursery pots, separated by a plastic plate, and submerged in tap water inside a 1-L open-spout plastic watering can for T2WI (TRTE 7500101 ms), DWI (550061 ms, ADC b50-800 smm(2) map) and MRS (940145 ms) at 3.0 T, with phased array surface coils. One green kiwi fruit was additionally examined with an endorectal coil. Retrospective comparison with benign peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) of prostate (n = 5), Gleason 6-7a prostate cancer (n = 8) and Gleason 7b-9 prostate cancer (n = 7) validated the phantom.; Mean contrast between central placenta (CP) and outer pericarp (OP, 0.346-0.349) or peripheral placenta (PP, 0.364-0.393) of kiwi fruit was similar to Gleason 7b-9 prostate cancer and PZ (0.308) in T2WI. ADC values of OP and PP (1.27 +- 0.07-1.37 +- 0.08 mm(2)s x 10(-3)) resembled PZ and TZ (1.39 +- 0.17-1.60 +- 0.24 mm(2)s x 10(-3)), while CP (0.91 +- 0.14-0.99 +- 0.10 mm(2)s x 10(-3)) resembled Gleason 7b-9 prostate cancer (1.00 +- 0.25 mm(2)s x 10(-3)). MR spectra showed peaks of citrate and myo-inositol in kiwi fruit, and citrate and "choline+creatine" in prostates. The phantom worked with an endorectal coil, too.; The kiwi fruit phantom reproducibly showed zones similar to PZ, TZ and cancer in human prostates in T2WI and DWI and two metabolite peaks in MRS and appears suitable to compare different MR protocols, coil systems and scanners.; aEuro cent Kiwi fruit appear suitable as phantoms for human prostate in MR examinations.; aEuro cent Kiwi fruit show zonal anatomy like human prostates in T2-weighted MRI and DWI.; aEuro cent MR spectroscopy reliably shows peaks in kiwi fruit (citrateinositol) and human prostates (citratecholine+creatine).; aEuro cent The kiwi fruit phantom works both with and without an endorectal coil.; aEuro cent EU regulation No. 5432011 specifies physical and biochemical properties of kiwi fruit.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Tractography is a popular tool for visualizing the corticospinal tract (CST). However, results may be influenced by numerous variables, eg, the selection of seeding regions of interests (ROIs) or the chosen tracking algorithm.
OBJECTIVE: To compare different variable sets by correlating tractography results with intraoperative subcortical stimulation of the CST, correcting intraoperative brain shift by the use of intraoperative MRI.; METHODS: Seeding ROIs were created by means of motor cortex segmentation, functional MRI (fMRI), and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Based on these ROIs, tractography was run for each patient using a deterministic and a probabilistic algorithm. Tractographies were processed on pre- and postoperatively acquired data.; RESULTS: Using a linear mixed effects statistical model, best correlation between subcortical stimulation intensity and the distance between tractography and stimulation sites was achieved by using the segmented motor cortex as seeding ROI and applying the probabilistic algorithm on preoperatively acquired imaging sequences. Tractographies based on fMRI or nTMS results differed very little, but with enlargement of positive nTMS sites the stimulation-distance correlation of nTMS-based tractography improved.; CONCLUSION: Our results underline that the use of tractography demands for careful interpretation of its virtual results by considering all influencing variables.

N2  -  Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of studying white matter tracts and connections between the thalamus and the cortex in 2-year-old infants who were born preterm by probabilistic magnetic resonance (MR) tractography. Using this approach, we were able to visualize and quantify connectivity distributions in a number of white matter tracts, including the corticospinal tracts, optic radiations, fibers of the germ and splenium of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and to map the distribution within thalamus of fibers connecting to specific cortical regions. In eleven infants with no MR evidence of focal cerebral lesions and appropriate neurodevelopment as shown by general quotient (GQ) scores above 100, we mapped cortical connections to the thalamus that appeared similar to those reported in adults. However, in a proof-of-principle experiment, we examined one further child with marked white matter abnormalities and found that the volume and pattern of thalamo-cortical connections were severely disrupted. This technique promises to be a useful tool for assessing connectivity in the developing brain and in infants with lesions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  This study proposes an umbrella deployment of swarm intelligence algorithm, such as stochastic diffusion search for medical imaging applications. After summarising the results of some previous works which shows how the algorithm assists in the identification of metastasis in bone scans and microcalcifications on mammographs, for the first time, the use of the algorithm in assessing the CT images of the aorta is demonstrated along with its performance in detecting the nasogastric tube in chest X-ray. The swarm intelligence algorithm presented in this study is adapted to address these particular tasks and its functionality is investigated by running the swarms on sample CT images and X-rays whose status have been determined by senior radiologists. In addition, a hybrid swarm intelligence-learning vector quantisation (LVQ) approach is proposed in the context of magnetic resonance (MR) brain image segmentation. The particle swarm optimisation is used to train the LVQ which eliminates the iteration-dependent nature of LVQ. The proposed methodology is used to detect the tumour regions in the abnormal MR brain images.

N2  -  With continuous refinement of neurosurgical techniques and higher resolution in neuroimaging, the management of pontine lesions is constantly improving. Among pontine structures with vital functions that are at risk of being damaged by surgical manipulation, cranial nerves (CN) and cranial nerve nuclei (CNN) such as CN V, VI, and VII are critical. Pre-operative localization of the intrapontine course of CN and CNN should be beneficial for surgical outcomes. Our objective was to accurately localize CN and CNN in patients with intra-axial lesions in the pons using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and estimate its input in surgical planning for avoiding unintended loss of their function during surgery. DTI of the pons obtained pre-operatively on a 3 Tesla MR scanner was analyzed prospectively for the accurate localization of CN and CNN V, VI and VII in seven patients with intra-axial lesions in the pons. Anatomical sections in the pons were used to estimate abnormalities on color-coded fractional anisotropy maps. Imaging abnormalities were correlated with CN symptoms before and after surgery. The course of CN and the area of CNN were identified using DTI pre- and post-operatively. Clinical associations between post-operative improvements and the corresponding CN area of the pons were demonstrated. Our results suggest that pre- and post-operative DTI allows identification of key anatomical structures in the pons and enables estimation of their involvement by pathology. It may predict clinical outcome and help us to better understand the involvement of the intrinsic anatomy by pathological processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Intraoperative line scan diffusion imaging (LSDI) on a 0.5 Tesla interventional MRI was performed during neurosurgery in three patients. Diffusion trace images were obtained in acute ischemic cases. Scan time per slice was 46 seconds and 94 seconds, respectively, for diffusion tensor images. Diagnosis of acutely developed vascular occlusion was confirmed with follow-up scans. White matter tracts were displayed with the principal eigenvectors and provided guidance for the tumor surgery. In all cases, the diagnostic utility of LSDI was established. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Objective: To observe the radiological characteristics of Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID) on lesion locations and diffusion property using quantitative imaging analysis. Methods: Visual inspection and quantitative analyses were performed on MRI data from 31 retrospectively included patients with NIID. Frequency heatmaps of lesion locations on T2WI and DWI were generated using voxel-wise analysis. Gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV) and diffusion property of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of patients were voxel-wisely compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the ADC values within the DWI-detected lesion were compared with those within the adjacent cortical gray matter and white matter. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) techniques, were used to determine the relationship between DWI lesion location and disease durations. Results: By visual inspection on the imaging findings, we proposed an "cockscomb flower sign" for describing the radiological feature of DWI hyperintensity within the corticomedullary junction. A "T2WI-DWI mismatch of spatial distribution" pattern was also revealed with visual inspection and frequency heatmaps, for describing the feature of a wider lesion distribution covering white matter shown on T2WI than that on DWI. Voxelbased morphometry comparison revealed that wildly reduced GMV and WMV, both the lesion areas detected by DWI and T2WI demonstrated ADC increase in patients. Furthermore, the ADC values within the DWIdetected lesion were intermediate between the adjacent cortex and the deep white matter with highest ADC. VLSM analysis revealed that frontal lobe, parietal lobe and internal capsule damage were associated with higher NIID durations. Conclusion: NIID features with "cockscomb flower-like" DWI hyperintensity in area of corticomedullary junction, based on a "T2WI-DWI mismatch of spatial distribution" of lesion locations. The pathological substrate of corticomedullary junction hyperintensity on DWI, can not be explained as diffusion restriction. These typical radiological features of brain MRI would be helpful for diagnosis of NIID. (c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is effective and safe for the treatment of the vast majority of brain metastases (BMs). SRS is increasingly used for the simultaneous treatment of multiple lesions, retreatment of recurrence, or subsequent treatment of new lesions. Although radiation injury is relatively uncommon, with the increased utilization of SRS, it is imperative to develop approaches to assess and mitigate radiation-induced neurologic toxicity. Multiple factors influence the development of radiation injury, including patient age, genomic variations, prior treatment, dose and volume treated, and anatomic location. Functional neural structure proximity to SRS targets is a critical factor in developing a systematic integrated risk assessment for SRS patients.; Methods; We developed an approach for risk assessment based on the combinatorial application of i) the anatomic localization of target lesions using a reference neuroanatomicalfunctional imaging atlas merged with patient-specific imaging and ii) validation with functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging MRI (DTI-MRI) to identify neural tracts.; Results; In the case of a thalamicmidbrain junction breast carcinoma metastasis, the reference image analysis revealed proximity to the corticospinal tract (CST), which was validated by functional DTI-MRI. Dose-volume exposure of the CST could be estimated and considered in the development of a final treatment plan.; Conclusion; Merging pretreatment MR imaging with neuroanatomicalfunctional reference MRIs and subsequent validation with fMRI or DTI-MRI may prove to be a valuable approach to screen for neural risks in individual SRS patients. Incorporating this approach in larger studies could further our understanding of dose tolerances in a broad range of neural structures.

N2  -  We report a case of temporal lobe granuloma caused by Candida albicans in an immunocompetent patient. This 54-year-old patient had experienced headaches and some memory disorders for two to three months before his admission to the neurosurgical department. Cerebral-computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a single right-temporal lesion with a large peritumoral edema. We operated on the patient. via a temporal approach using neuronavigation and resected the lesion. The anatomopathological result and the cultures of the granuloma showed C. albicans species. The patient received antifungal therapy for three months. No predisposing factors or immunosuppression was found. After seven months, lie presented an ischemic cerebrovascular accident of the brain stem and then chronic meningitis complicated by hydrocephalus. The patient's condition progressively deteriorated and he died IS months later in an other department. C albicans can be found even in the immunocompetent patient. but is seldom observed. Surgery can provide an accurate diagnosis and therapeutic management in the initial phase, completed by antifungal therapy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

N2  -  Purpose of review
This study summarizes recent advances in neuroimaging of therapy-related brain tissue abnormalities.; Recent findings; Pseudoprogression constitutes a typical posttherapeutic phenomenon in patients with glioblastoma treated with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Advanced MRI techniques, such as diffusion MRI and perfusion MRI, can be helpful to distinguish it from true tumor progression. In clinical trials on amyloidmodifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease patients, previously unknown, characteristic nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic amyloid-related imaging abnormalities have been observed. Awareness of this phenomenon is essential for therapy monitoring. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome can both occur as a complication of a variety of systemic drug therapies and present with a wide spectrum of clinical and imaging findings. The pathomechanisms underlying these different therapy-related brain tissue changes are only poorly understood.; Summary; Neuroimaging, including advanced MRI techniques, plays a key role in the identification and monitoring of therapy-associated brain tissue abnormalities. However, future imaging studies should focus on the pathomechanism underlying these phenomena.

N2  -  Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated to play an important role in the destruction of the extracellular matrix in diseases of the central nervous system. This study investigated whether the expression of one of these proteases, MMP-9 in blood, is related to the size of human brain infarcts assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. Consecutively, twenty-one acute stroke patients were included prospectively into our study. In blood samples drawn within 24 h after onset, MMP-9 RNA-expression and proteolytic-activity were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and gelatin zymography, respectively. The ischemic lesion volumes in time to peak perfusion maps and diffusion weighted imaging were measured morphometrically. RNA-expression levels of MMP-9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) correlated with the brain infarct lesion (TTP-delay 4 s, r = -0.61, p = 0.007; TTP-delay 6 s: r = -0.58, p = 0.012; DWI r = -0.47; p = 0.047). Our preliminary results demonstrate that MMP-9 RNA is upregulated in PBMCs in proportion to ischemia. These findings suggest that MMP-9 might contribute to the manifestation of ischemic brain damage. Since MMP-9 is upregulated in acute ischemia inhibition of MMP-9 may represent a complementary treatment target in acute stroke therapy.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are low-flow vascular malformations made up of dilated vascular spaces without intervening parenchyma that can occur throughout the central nervous system. CCMs can occur sporadically or in familial forms. Presentation is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic discoveries to drug-resistant epilepsy and hemorrhages. METHODS: We describe the surgical management of CCMs in pediatric patients at Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome over the last 10 years. The cases have been stratified based on the clinical presentation and the relevant literature is discussed accordingly. RESULTS: We discuss the rationale and technique used in these cases based on their presentation, as well as the generally positive outcomes we achieved with early surgical management, use of intra-operative ultrasound (ioUS) and intraoperative neuromonitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of pediatric CCMs is a safe and effective strategy, low rates of postoperative morbidity and partial resection were observed. Introduction Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCMs), also called Cavernous Angiomas, Cavernous Hemangiomas and Cavernomas, are low-flow vascular malformations found throughout the central nervous system. Histologically, CCMs are made up of dilated, sinusoidal vascular spaces ("caverns") with single layer endothelium and no intervening parenchyma 1. Angiographically occult 2, the diagnostic gold standard for CCMs is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in particular susceptibility weighted (SWI) sequences3. CCMs can occur either sporadically or as part of familial forms, with identical histological features4. Familial forms are caused by heterozygous loss-of-function germline mutations in one of three genes: KRIT1, Malcavernin and PDCD10, also termed CCM1, CCM2 and CCM3 respectively 5, which encode proteins required for maintenance of normal vasculature 6. CCMs can furthermore occur after radiation therapy to the brain 7. While CCMs usually become symptomatic and are thus diagnosed in adult patients, they can affect children as well 8. Clinical presentation includes seizures, hemorrhage and mass effect signs, including focal neurological deficits, headache and hydrocephalus. We report our surgical experience in the treatment of brain CCMs at a tertiary pediatric neurosurgical center over the last decade, focusing on treatment strategy and its rationales. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical charts and surgical records of patients treated at the Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital from January 2010 to June 2020. Inclusion criteria were: surgical resection of a brain lesion with histological diagnosis of CCM and age <18 years at the time of surgery. Follow-up was considered until November 2020. We collected data including demographics, family history and relevant genetic mutations, time between presentation and surgery, clinical outcomes and follow-up duration. All patients underwent preoperative MRI with a 3T scanner (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with imaging protocol including: axial and coronal T2-weighted sequences, axial FLAIR, axial DWI pre-contrast and post-contrast volumetric MPRAGE sequence and a gradient echo (GE, in 13 patients) or a SWI sequence (in 13 patients). In case of involvement of eloquent brain regions, functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data with tractography reconstructions were obtained preoperatively as part of the pre-surgical planning.
Pre-operative and post-operative radiologic findings were reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist to evaluate data concerning number, size and location of the lesions. In patients presenting with hemorrhage, axial dimensions of the hematoma were measured; in those presenting with seizures postsurgical hemosiderin ring removal was evaluated on GE, SWI or, if not available, on T2-weighted sequences. Genetic testing for known CCM-related mutations was performed on all patients with family history of CCMs or harboring multiple lesions. Following informed consent, patient genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Mutations were identified through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach (Twist Custom Panel-Twist Bioscience) and NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platforms (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Identified variant was evaluated by VarSome9 and classified according to ACMG guidelines 10. In all cases, the surgical approach was tailored to the lesion location and the surgical procedure was carried out with the aid of neuronavigation (Stealthstation and S7, Medtronic, USA) and under microscopic vision for the intradural portion of the procedure (Pentero, Zeiss, Switzerland). Since 2015, intraoperative ultrasonography (Bk 5000, BK ultrasound, Denmark) was performed intraoperatively. In the latter part of the series (since 2018), virtual reconstruction (Surgical Theater, SNAP, USA) was used to review surgical strategy. Neuronavigation, and ioUS, together with 3D virtual reality after it became available, were used to design craniotomy and the best approach to the lesion. Intraoperative Ultrasound (ioUS) was used to orient the surgeon intraoperatively and to evaluate the extent of resection. In case of eloquent areas involvement, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), trans-cranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEP), electroencephalogram (EEG) and direct electrical brain stimulation was applied, depending on CCM location. Since presentation modality largely conditioned our management strategy, the cases were grouped based on presentation modality (epilepsy, hemorrhage, raised intracranial pressure without evidence of recent hemorrhage, asymptomatic) and each scenario is discussed separately. Results We identified 26 patients who underwent surgical resection of histologically-confirmed intracranial CCMs (Figure 1). Overall, a total of 29 surgeries were performed on 27 CCMs in 26 patients: three patients underwent surgery twice. Among this latter group, one patient was treated for two different CCMs, while in two cases the second surgery was performed due to incomplete removal of the CCM during the first procedure. Seventeen patients were males, 9 females (M:F = 1.9:1). Mean age at the time of symptoms' onset was 9.95 years, the average age at surgery being 10.62 years. Mean follow-up duration was 36 months (range 4 months -6.5 years) Twenty-five CCMs were supratentorial, 1 cerebellar and 1 bulbar. Of the 25 supratentorial CCMs, 8 were frontal, 7 parietal, 3 temporal, 3 occipital, 1 insular, 1 fronto-parietal, 1 parieto-occipital and 1 subependymal, in the region of the right Foramen of Monro.

N2  -  Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a significant challenge in terms of its clinical diagnosis due to it being a rare disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the multimodality imaging characteristics, clinical features and reasons for misdiagnosis of LC with the goal of potentially facilitating early and accurate diagnosis of this frequently misdiagnosed disease. In the present study, clinical data and cerebral multimodality imaging findings from 11 patients with LC proven based on pathology were retrospectively analyzed and reviewed with consultation of the literature. The results indicated that the common symptoms included cognitive decline (8/11), gait disturbance (9/11) and behavioral abnormalities (5/11). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated that the number of cells and level of protein increased (8/10). All patients had both deep and lobar lesion distribution of bilateral cerebral white matter with equal or slightly low-density shadows on CT plain scan and slightly longer signals on T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Most of the lesions (9/11) exhibited isointensity or slight hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In addition, five patients presented with a marked decrease in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and increase in choline/Cr on H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including an increase in lipid/Cr in 3 cases. Of these, one case exhibited no increase in lesion metabolism and 2 cases had slightly increased uptake on positron emission tomography/CT. The present study indicated that the multimodality imaging findings of LC have certain distinct characteristics and prompt recognition of these features may significantly improve early diagnosis and patient prognosis. Misdiagnosis may be mainly due to insufficient understanding knowledge of the condition and improper brain biopsy.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the utility of multimodal quantitative MRI (qMRI) and atlas-based methods to identify characteristics of lesion-driven injury and neurodegeneration in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 2558 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;.

N2  -  Introduction Our goal was to evaluate whether the T1 shortening effect caused by contrast leakage into brain tumors, a well-known confounding effect in the quantification of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements, may be corrected by the administration of a predose of gadolinium-DTPA.
Methods As part of their presurgical imaging protocol, 25 patients with primary brain tumors underwent two consecutive dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR studies. Intratumoral rCBV measurements and normalized rCBV values obtained during the first-pass and second-bolus studies were compared (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). The frequency of relatively increased rCBV ratios on the second-bolus study was compared between enhancing and non-enhancing neoplasms (Fisher's exact test). Postprocessing perfusion studies were evaluated for image quality on a scale of 0-3 (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). Four studies were excluded due to unacceptable image quality.; Results Mean normalized rCBVs were 9.04 (SD 4.64) for the first-pass and 7.99 (SD 3.84) for the second-bolus study. There was no statistically significant difference between the two perfusion studies in either intratumoral rCBV (P=0.237) or rCBV ratio (P=0.181). Five enhancing and four non-enhancing tumors showed a relative increase in rCBV ratio on the second-bolus study, without a significant difference between the groups. Image quality was not significantly different between perfusion studies.; Conclusion Our results did not demonstrate a significant difference between first-pass and second-bolus rCBV measurements in DSC perfusion MR imaging. The administration of a predose of gadolinium-DTPA does not appear to be an efficient way of compensating for the underestimation of intratumoral rCBV values due to the T1 shortening effect.

N2  -  Purpose: Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) with diffusion-weighted images has wide utility in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). However, bpMRI yields more false-negatives for PIRADS category 3 lesions than multiparametric (mp)MRI with dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. We investigated the utility of synthetic MRI with relaxometry maps for bpMRI-based diagnosis of csPCa.& nbsp;Methods: One hundred and five treatment-naive patients who underwent mpMRI and synthetic MRI before prostate biopsy for suspected PCa between August 2019 and December 2020 were prospectively included. Three experts and three basic prostate radiologists evaluated the diagnostic performance of conventional bpMRI and synthetic bpMRI for csPCa. PI-RADS version 2.1 category 3 lesions were identified by consensus, and relaxometry measurements (T1-value, T2-value, and proton density [PD]) were performed. The diagnostic performance of relaxometry measurements for PI-RADS category 3 lesions in peripheral zone was compared with that of DCE-MRI. Histopathological evaluation results were used as the reference standard. Statistical analysis was performed using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and McNemar test.& nbsp;Results: In 102 patients without significant MRI artefacts, the diagnostic performance of conventional bpMRI was not significantly different from that of synthetic bpMRI for all readers (p = 0.11-0.79). The AUCs of the combination of T1-value, T2-value, and PD (T1 + T2 + PD) for csPCa in peripheral zone for PI-RADS category 3 lesions were 0.85 for expert and 0.86 for basic radiologists, with no significant difference between T1 + T2 + PD and DCE-MRI for both expert and basic radiologists (p = 0.29-0.45).& nbsp;Conclusion: Synthetic MRI with relaxometry maps shows promise for contrast media-free evaluation of csPCa.

N2  -  Purpose: To exploit diffusion imaging tractography to produce a two-dimensional (xy) probabilistic population map of the cortical connections within the human internal capsule (IC).
Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was carried out on 11 healthy volunteers. We parceled an axial section of the IC according to its connections to the prefrontal, premotor, primary motor, primary somatosensory, posterior parietal, and occipital cortices using our locally developed probabilistic algorithm.; Results: A consistent topographical organization was generated that was consistent with our anatomical knowledge of the IC. In addition, our study shows that in humans the anterior half of the IC is occupied by the prefrontal cortex.; Conclusion: This map may be of clinical use for correlating neurological deficit with hemispheric lesions, particularly those that affect sensorimotor function.

N2  -  The use of DSC-MR imaging in pediatric neuroradiology is gradually growing. However, the number of studies listed in the literature remains limited. We propose to assess the perfusion and permeability parameters in pediatric brain tumor grading.
Thirty children with a brain tumor having benefited from a DSC-MR perfusion sequence have been retrospectively explored. Relative CBF and CBV were computed on the ROI with the largest lesion coverage. Assessment of the lesion's permeability was also performed through the semi-quantitative PSR parameter and the K2 model-based parameter on the whole-lesion ROI and a reduced ROI drawn on the permeability maps. A statistical comparison of high- and low-grade groups (HG, LG) as well as a ROC analysis was performed on the histogram-based parameters.; Our results showed a statistically significant difference between LG and HG groups for mean rCBV (p < 10(-3)), rCBF (p < 10(-3)), and for PSR (p = 0.03) but not for the K2 factor (p = 0.5). However, the ratio K2PSR was shown to be a strong discriminating factor between the two groups of lesions (p < 10(-3)). For rCBV and rCBF indicators, high values of ROC AUC were obtained (> 0.9) and mean value thresholds were observed at 1.07 and 1.03, respectively. For K2PSR in the reduced area, AUC was also superior to 0.9.; The implementation of a dynamic T2* perfusion sequence provided reliable results using an objective whole-lesion ROI. Perfusion parameters as well as a new permeability indicator could efficiently discriminate high-grade from low-grade lesions in the pediatric population.

N2  -  Simple Summary Brain metastases (BM) are the most common central nervous system tumor in adults. Conventional qualitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, assists in the diagnosis, treatment selection, monitoring, and prognostic determination of BM. Quantitative relaxometry (T1 and T2) measurements, besides other quantitative methods like diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI, are important for characterization of BMs, as well as elucidation of their underlying tumor tissue patho-physiology. New, rapid relaxometry methods, such as MR Fingerprinting (MRF), can provide tumor patho-physiology information within a single MRI acquisition and a clinically feasible timeframe. The purpose of the present pilot study was to estimate T1 and T2 metric values derived simultaneously from a new, rapid MRF technique and assess their ability to characterize BM and normal-appearing brain tissues. Our results showed that T1 (index for free water content) and T2 (index for tissue morphology) mapping may quantitatively characterize BMs. Our initial findings need to be validated in a larger patient cohort. The purpose of the present pilot study was to estimate T1 and T2 metric values derived simultaneously from a new, rapid Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) technique, as well as to assess their ability to characterize-brain metastases (BM) and normal-appearing brain tissues. Fourteen patients with BM underwent MRI, including prototype MRF, on a 3T scanner. In total, 108 measurements were analyzed: 42 from solid parts of BM's (21 each on T1 and T2 maps) and 66 from normal-appearing brain tissue (11 ROIs each on T1 and T2 maps for gray matter [GM], white matter [WM], and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]). The BM's mean T1 and T2 values differed significantly from normal-appearing WM (p < 0.05). The mean T1 values from normal-appearing GM, WM, and CSF regions were 1205 ms, 840 ms, and 4233 ms, respectively. The mean T2 values were 108 ms, 78 ms, and 442 ms, respectively. The mean T1 and T2 values for untreated BM (n = 4) were 2035 ms and 168 ms, respectively. For treated BM (n = 17) the T1 and T2 values were 2163 ms and 141 ms, respectively. MRF technique appears to be a promising and rapid quantitative method for the characterization of free water content and tumor morphology in BMs.

N2  -  In patients with traumatic brain injury TBI), diffuse axonal injury (DAI) accounts for a significant amount of parenchymal injury. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is known to be sensitive for detecting visible DAI lesions. We focused on detection of non-visible, quantifiable diffusion changes in specific normal-appearing brain regions, using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Thirty-seven adults with TBI were compared to 35 age-matched control patients. DWI was performed and ADC maps were generated. Thirty-one regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn on ADC maps and ADC values extracted. Brain ROIs were categorized into five zones: peripheral gray matter, peripheral white matter, deep gray matter, deep white matter, and posterior fossa. ADC results were compared with the severity of injury based on the admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS 3-8; severe; GSC 9-15 mild/moderate) and with long-term outcome (6-12 months after injury) using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS 1-3, unfavorable; GOS: 4-5, favorable) score. Mean ADC values in all five brain zones were significantly different between TBI subjects and controls (P <= 0.05). Patients with more severe injury (i.e., GCS 3-8) had significantly different mean ADC values than control patients (p :5 0.05) and patients with unfavorable outcomes had significantly higher mean deep gray and white matter ADC values compared to those with favorable outcomes and to controls (p :5 0.05). Thus, ADC maps can be used to detect non-visible DAI lesions. In addition, injuries in the deep gray and white matter may be useful to predict outcome in adult TBI patients.

N2  -  The temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction is a complex brain territory heavily involved in several high-level neurological functions, such as language, visuo-spatial recognition, writing, reading, symbol processing, calculation, self-processing, working memory, musical memory, and face and object recognition. Recent studies indicate that this area is covered by a thick network of white matter (WM) connections, which provide efficient and multimodal integration of information between both local and distant cortical nodes. It is important for neurosurgeons to have good knowledge of the three-dimensional subcortical organisation of this highly connected region to minimise post-operative permanent deficits. The aim of this dissection study was to highlight the subcortical functional anatomy from a topographical surgical perspective. Eight human hemispheres (four left, four right) obtained from four human cadavers were dissected according to Klingler's technique. Proceeding latero-medially, the authors describe the anatomical courses of and the relationships between the main pathways crossing the TPO. The results obtained from dissection were first integrated with diffusion tensor imaging reconstructions and subsequently with functional data obtained from three surgical cases, all resection of infiltrating glial tumours using direct electrical mapping in awake patients. The subcortical limits for performing safe lesionectomies within the TPO region are as follows: within the parietal region, the anterior horizontal part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and, more deeply, the arcuate fasciculus; dorsally, the vertical projective thalamo-cortical fibres. For lesions located within the temporal and occipital lobes, the resection should be tailored according to the orientation of the horizontal associative pathways (the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, inferior longitudinal fascicle and optic radiation). The relationships between the WM tracts and the ventricle system were also examined. These results indicate that a detailed anatomo-functional awareness of the WM architecture within the TPO area is mandatory when approaching intrinsic brain lesions to optimise surgical results and to minimise post-operative morbidity.

N2  -  Background: The impact of poststroke seizures on the neurological deficits related to ischemic stroke is not well known. It has been reported that following poststroke epilepsy, transient or long-lasting worsening of the poststroke sequelae may develop, but the underlying mechanism of deficit worsening has not been systematically studied by magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (MRI-DWI). Methods: From 2008 to 2009, 1,010 ischemic stroke patients were admitted to our stroke unit at the Ege University Hospital with first-time strokes. Of these, 76 (7.5%) patients developed delayed seizures in a follow-up period of 18 months. We extracted the clinical and imaging data of the patients from our Stroke Registry databases and other medical records, and evaluated brain MRI, including spin-echo DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, FLAIR and T2-weighted images. Results: There were 15 (20%) patients who had long-lasting worsening of the previous neurological sequelae, which we called long-lasting neurological worsening (LLW); 38 (50%) had transient neurological worsening (TNW) and 23 (30%) were without neurological worsening (WNW) after poststroke seizures. DWI findings were present in 3/23 (13%) patients with simple partial-type seizure, in 4/17 (29%) patients with complex partial-type seizure, and in 7/13 (54%) patients with generalized toni-clonic type seizure (p = 0.002). Patients with LLW showed more frequent changes on DWI than those with TNW (53 vs. 16%; p = 0.009). Forty percent of patients with LLW and 5% of those with TNW had ADC decrease (p = 0.004). Patients with LLW had DWI changes in the occipital region more frequently than those with TNW (57 vs. 18%; p = 0.05). Correlation analysis found a significant association between LLW and DWI changes, multiple DWI lesions, ADC decrease, and recurrent seizures. In the control MRI-DWI 1 month after the poststroke seizure, no signal abnormalities were detected in neuroimaging studies of all patients. Despite no functional outcome differences between the groups before the seizure, the functional scales 1 week after the seizure (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index) showed significantly worse neurological functional statements in the patients with LLW than those with TNW and WNW (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Poststroke seizures may affect poststroke sequelae transiently, which we see more often, but some seizure types may prolong the duration of deficits. Multiple DWI changes and LLW following recurrent and longer poststroke seizures were strongly associated, and this may be due to the effect of seizures causing additional metabolical changes.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Infection associated with an intracranial meningioma is an extremely rare condition. Only six cases have been described in the literature. Because of its dual pathologies, initial radiologic diagnosis can be difficult. We present the first reported case of multiple infected intracranial meningiomas and correlate the radiologic and histologic findings.
METHODS: A 70-year-old woman presented with sepsis and a left hemiparesis following ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. A large right parietal lesion and a smaller left frontal lesion were diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging and an apparent diffusion coefficient map demonstrated features of cerebral metastases.; RESULTS: A 2-stage excision confirmed atypical meningiomas containing an intratumoral abscess secondary to Escherichia coli. The patient made a full neurologic recovery. Despite the additional techniques, the radiologic diagnosis was initially challenging because of the dual pathologies. Nonetheless, the radiologic appearance was consistent with the complex histologic findings.; CONCLUSIONS: In the appropriate clinical context, diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map aid the diagnosis of infected intracranial meningiomas.

N2  -  Purpose: This study aimed to assess the relationship between mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) values from whole-brain diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parametric maps in preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images from 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System integrated glioma groups. Methods: Seventy-seven patients with histopathologically confirmed treatment-naive glioma were retrospectively assessed between 1 August 2013 and 30 October 2017. The area on scatter plots with a specific combination of MK and MD values, not occurring in the healthy brain, was labeled, and the corresponding voxels were visualized on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Reversely, the labeled voxels were compared to those of the manually segmented tumor volume, and the Dice similarity coefficient was used to investigate their spatial overlap. Results: A specific combination of MK and MD values in whole-brain DKI maps, visualized on a two-dimensional scatter plot, exclusively occurs in glioma tissue including the perifocal infiltrative zone and is absent in tissue of the normal brain or from other intracranial compartments. Conclusions: A unique diffusion signature with a specific combination of MK and MD values from whole-brain DKI can identify diffuse glioma without any previous segmentation. This feature might influence artificial intelligence algorithms for automatic tumor segmentation and provide new aspects of tumor heterogeneity.

N2  -  Modifications in the contralateral "healthy" hemisphere in a population of rats bearing cortical infarction were studied in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the aim to investigate whether cerebral areas not directly involved in the lesion react at the presence of an ischemic lesion. The study was performed in rats in which a transtemporal approach was adopted to occlude the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). For MRI, the animals were examined at 4.7 Tesla and quantitative T2 parametric images were obtained by a multiecho sequence. Healthy rats and sham-operated animals were used as control groups. The quantitative T2 parametric images showed that in the first week after the ischemia a significant increase in the mean T2 was seen in the lesioned parietal cortex, compared to the corresponding region of healthy rats (106 msec vs. 68 msec, P < 0.001). The contralateral "healthy" hemisphere showed T2 mean values not significantly different from the corresponding hemisphere of healthy rats (71 msec vs. 76 msec). However, a statistically significant increase in the T2 values was evident in the hypothalamic region (74 msec vs. 66 msec, P < 0.001). In rats examined 1 month after the ischemia, the T2 values of the hypothalamus were lower than those observed one week after ischemia (69 msec) but remained higher than in controls. The present study demonstrates that after a cerebral ischemia areas of secondary involvement distant from the lesion are present and can be studied in vivo by quantitative MRI.

N2  -  We report the findings on serial diffusion-weighted MRI in a 29-year-old male with neuro-Behcet's disease. Initial T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a hyperintense lesion in the brain stem. The lesion showed slight hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images with no evidence of diffusion restriction on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. A follow up study after 7 months showed complete resolution of the brain stem lesion. Our findings indicate that diffusion-weighted imaging is a useful tool to differentiate acute exacerbation of neuro-Behcet's disease from acute infarction, and therefore it helps in selecting the appropriate therapy.

N2  -  Objective Our purpose was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted imaging, the relative minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (rADCmin) in differentiating primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) from glioblastomas (GBMs) and inflammatory demyelinating pseudotumors (IDPs).
Materials and Methods Magnetic resonance images were reviewed retrospectively in 82 patients including 39 PCNSLs, 35 GBMs, and 8 IDPs. Regions of interest were drawn around the tumor on contrast-enhanced axial images; these images were transferred onto coregistered ADC maps to obtain the ADCmin, and the normalized ADCmin ratios (rADCmin) were calculated using the formula rADCmin = ADCmin of the lesion  ADCmin of the normal white matter. The rADCmin values were compared between PCNSLs, GBMs, and IDPs using the analysis of variance test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of rADCmin values and to determine the optimum thresholds. Simple logistic regression was analyzed to evaluate the relationship between ADCs and tumor cellularity.; Results The rADCmin value was significantly lower in PCNSLs (0.675 0.113) than GBMs (0.765 +- 0.059) and IDPs (0.834 +- 0.067) (PCNSL vs GBM, P < 0.001; PCNSL vs IDP, P < 0.001). Relative ADCmin was a significant assessor for differentiating PCNSLs from non-PCNCLs (P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value was 0.722 (sensitivity, 74.5%; specificity, 74.1%; area under the curve, 0.803) on receiver operating characteristic analysis. A stronger negative correlation (r = -0.755, P = 0.000) was obtained between the cytoplasm and rADCmin.; Conclusions Relative ADCmin value is helpful in differentiating PCNSL from GBM and IDP. Thus, ADC values may provide a useful supplement to the information obtained from conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and assist in future treatment planning.

N2  -  Glioblastoma is the most aggressive adult primary brain tumor which is incurable despite intensive multimodal treatment. Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity poses one of the biggest barriers in the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma, causing differences in treatment response and outcome. Noninvasive prognostic and predictive tests are highly needed to complement the current armamentarium. Noninvasive testing of glioblastoma uses multiple techniques that can capture the heterogeneity of glioblastoma. This set of diagnostic approaches comprises advanced MRI techniques, nuclear imaging, liquid biopsy, and new integrated approaches including radiogenomics and radiomics. New treatment options such as agents targeted at driver oncogenes and immunotherapy are currently being developed, but benefit for glioblastoma patients still has to be demonstrated. Understanding and unraveling tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment can help to create a treatment regime that is patient-tailored to these specific tumor characteristics. Improved noninvasive tests are crucial to this success. This review discusses multiple diagnostic approaches and their effect on predicting and monitoring treatment response in glioblastoma.

N2  -  We report a case of heat stroke in which detection of brain injury was improved by high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). High b-value DWI revealed moderate to marked hyperintensity at/around bilateral dentate nuclei and part of thalami. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps revealed apparent diffusion coefficient decrease of the dentate lesions. Routine DWI showed only mild hyperintensity of part of dentate lesions. High b-value DWI could be valuable for improved detection of heat stroke-induced brain injury.

N2  -  Susac syndrome (SS) is a clinical triad of hearing loss, retinal artery occlusion and encephalopathy. The typical MR imaging findings of multiple focal lesions in the corpus callosum and subcortical white matter can be easily misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis. On diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging, new lesions were hyperintense, with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). These lesions later became less prominent or hypointense on subsequent DW MR imaging. Serial DW imaging and ADC maps may be useful in differentiating SS from demyelinating diseases.

N2  -  Since the birth of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - a noninvasive tool able to visualize brain function-now 15 years ago. several clinical applications have emerged. fMRI follows from the neurovascular coupling between neuronal electrical activity and cerebrovascular physiology that leads to three effects that can contribute to the fMRI signal: an increase in the blood flow velocity, in the blood volume and in the blood oxygenation level. The latter effect. gave the technique the name blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. One of the major clinical uses is presurgical fMRI in patients with brain abnormalities. The goals of presurgical fMRI are threefold: 1) assessing the risk of neurological deficit that follows a surgical procedure, 2) selecting patients for invasive intraoperative mapping. and 3) guiding of the surgical procedure itself. These are reviewed here. Unfortunately, randomized trials or outcome studies that definitively show benefits to the final outcome of the patient when applying fMRI presurgically have not been performed. Therefore, fMRI has not vet reached the status of clinical acceptance. The final purpose of this article is to define a roadmap of future research and developments in order to tilt pre-surgical fMRI to the status of clinical validity and acceptance.

N2  -  Surgical resection of brain tumours aims at the maximal safe resection of the pathological tissue with minimal functional impairment. To achieve this objective, reliable anatomical landmarks are indispensable to navigate into the brain. The neuronavigation system can provide information to target the location of the patient's lesion, but after the craniotomy, a brain shift and relaxation mismatch with it often occur. By contrast, sulci/gyri are topological cerebral landmarks in individual patients and do shift with the brain parenchyma during lesion removal, but remain independent from brain shift in relation to the sulci/gyri. Here, we present a case report of a novel strategy based on anatomical landmarks to guide intraoperative brain tumour resection, without using a standard neuronavigation system. A preoperative brain mapping of the peri-tumoural sulci by the MRI and surface reconstruction was followed by confirmation of the anatomical landmarks for the motor cortex using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. The resulting location was used as a seed for diffusion tensor imaging tractography to reconstruct the corticospinal tracts. These selected cortical landmarks (sulci/gyri) delimited the margins of the two lesions and the specific location under which the corticospinal tract courses, thus facilitating monitoring of the peri-tumoural region during brain resection. In this case, 96% of the brain tumour from the pericentral somatomotor region was successfully removed without chronic post-operative motor impairments. This approach is based on cortical anatomy that is fixed during surgery and does not suffer from the brain shift that could misplace the lesion according to the neuronavigation system.

N2  -  Trans-synaptic degeneration could exacerbate neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess whether anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration could be identified in the primary visual pathway in vivo. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to assess the optic radiations in 15 patients with previous optic nerve inflammation and 9 healthy volunteers. A probabilistic atlas of the optic radiations was created from healthy diffusion tractography data. Lengthwise profiles for DTI parameters (axial [gimel vertical bar vertical bar|], radial [gimel perpendicular to] and mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA] and the angle of deviation of the principal eigenvector [alpha]) were analyzed for patients and controls. Patients also underwent multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) assessments to characterize the latency and amplitude of cortical potentials. Correlations were performed between mfVEP latency and amplitude in the left and right visual hemi-fields and DTI parameters in the contra-lateral optic radiations. Patients displayed a significant decrease in lambda vertical bar vertical bar within the body of both optic radiations, which significantly correlated with loss of mfVEP amplitude. Abnormal gimel perpendicular to and FA were detected bilaterally throughout the optic radiations in patients but the abnormality was not associated with amplitude reduction or latency prolongation of the mfVEP. An abnormal a value was observed in the left optic radiations of patients, and the a value in the body of the optic radiations also correlated with mfVEP amplitude loss. The assocation between bilateral DTI abnormalities within the optic radiations and loss of afferent electrical activity could indicate anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration occurs following optic neuritis.

N2  -  Introduction: Based on the tumor's growth potential and aggressiveness, glioma is most often classified into low or high-grade groups. Traditionally, tissue sampling is used to determine the glioma grade. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the Laplacian Re-decomposition (LRD) medical image fusion algorithm for glioma grading by advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and introduce the best image combination for glioma grading.
Material and methods: Sixty-one patients (17 low-grade and 44 high-grade) underwent Susceptibility-weighted image (SWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI imaging. To fuse different MRI image, LRD medical image fusion algorithm was used. To evaluate the effectiveness of LRD in the classification of glioma grade, we compared the parameters of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).; Results: The average Relative Signal Contrast (RSC) of SWI and ADC maps in high-grade glioma are significantly lower than RSCs in low-grade glioma. No significant difference was detected between low and high-grade glioma on FLAIR images. In our study, the area under the curve (AUC) for low and high-grade glioma differentiation on SWI and ADC maps were calculated at 0.871 and 0.833, respectively.; Conclusions: By fusing SWI and ADC map with LRD medical image fusion algorithm, we can increase AUC for low and high-grade glioma separation to 0.978. Our work has led us to conclude that, by fusing SWI and ADC map with LRD medical image fusion algorithm, we reach the highest diagnostic accuracy for low and high-grade glioma differentiation and we can use LRD medical fusion algorithm for glioma grading.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) represents beta-amyloid deposition in the small- and medium-sized vessels of the brain and meninges. CAA contributes to altered vessel function and is associated with white matter damage, cognitive impairment, and most salient, hemorrhagic stroke. We used diffusion tensor imaging to evaluate the anatomic distribution of white matter degeneration in participants diagnosed with advanced CAA.
Methods-Diffusion tensor imaging was obtained from 11 participants dial-nosed with CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage and 13 matched healthy control participants. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity maps were compared using voxel based t test and region-of-interest analyses.; Results-FA was reduced in CAA in temporal white matter and in the splenium of the corpus callosum (P < 0.001 with approximate to 17% reduction in temporal white matter and 15% reduction in the splenium). FA was marginally increased in CAA in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and subthalamic gray matter regions (approximate to 7% increase in subthalamic gray). FA changes were bilateral, remained significant in cluster analysis controlling for multiple comparisons, and did not depend on the hemisphere of the cerebral hemorrhage. Diffusivity was not substantially altered.; Conclusions-These findings suggest that a pattern of regional brain tissue degeneration is a characteristic feature of advanced CAA.

We report our preliminary experience of abnormal prenatal DWI findings in the brains of eight fetuses with suspected lesions on the basis of clinical and ultrasound findings. The diffusion-weighted echo-planar sequence, which had an acquisition time of 14-18 seconds, was performed with the mother holding her breath. Slice thickness varied from 5 to 6 mm, the TR was 4000-5000 ms, the TE was 81 ms, the in plane resolution was 2.5x2.5 mm. Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) trace maps were calculated on the basis of three axes diffusion-sensitized images. In two cases, hypoxic-ischemic focal lesions showed a DWI signal compatible with the acute or subacute stage. In two cases of recent fetal death, the brain ADC was markedly decreased. In a case of fetus papyraceus, the intracranial ADC value suggested the brain having a solid structure. In a case of intraventricular hemorrhage, the lesion was more conspicuous on DWI than on conventional images. In a case of brain developmental malformations, the ADC showed values compatible with decreased cellular proliferation disorders. In a case of intracranial cystic mass, DWI readily differentiated between an arachnoid and an epidermoid cyst. DWI appears to enhance the prenatal MRI capability of characterizing hypoxic-ischemic lesions. Moreover, prenatal DWI seems to provide valuable information on the timing of fetal death. ADC determination can provide additional data on the nature of brain malformations in cases of abnormal development.

T2  -  NEUROLOGIA MEDICO-CHIRURGICA

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently evolved as valuable technique to investigate diffuse axonal injury (DAI). This study examined whether fractional anisotropy (FA) images analyzed by statistical parametric mapping (FA-SPM images) are superior to T-2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (T2*GRE) images or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images for detecting minute lesions in traumatic brain injury (TB!) patients. DTI was performed in 25 patients with cognitive impairments in the chronic stage after mild or moderate TBI. The FA maps obtained from the DTI were individually compared with those from age-matched healthy control subjects using voxel-based analysis and FA-SPM images (p < 0.001). Abnormal low-intensity areas on T2*GRE images (T2* lesions) were found in 10 patients (40.0%), abnormal high-intensity areas on FLAIR images in 4 patients (16.0%), and areas with significantly decreased FA on FA-SPM image in 16 patients (64.0%). Nine of 10 patients with T2* lesions had FA-SPM lesions. FA-SPM lesions topographically included most T2* lesions in the white matter and the deep brain structures, but did not include T2* lesions in the cortex/near-cortex or lesions containing substantial hemosiderin regardless of location. All 4 patients with abnormal areas on FLAIR images had FA-SPM lesions. FA-SPM imaging is useful for detecting minute lesions because of DAI in the white matter and the deep brain structures, which may not be visualized on T2*GRE or FLAIR images, and may allow the detection of minute brain lesions in patients with post-traumatic cognitive impairment.

N2  -  A variety of etiologies underlie the neurophysiological imbalance resulting in chorea. We report a 57-year-old woman with a long-history of migraine who suddenly experienced concurrent scintillating scotoma and rapid involuntary movement of her neck and right extremities. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) failed to detect any fresh ischemic and/or hemorrhagic lesions. Xenon-computed tomography (CT) disclosed gross reduction in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the left occipital area. With precise mapping to the brain atlas, extreme hyperperfusion in the motor thalamus was found on the left side. Asymmetrical CBF reduction of the left subthalamic nucleus was also noted. Her symptoms gradually improved and completely disappeared within 15 days. Repeated xenon-CT 1 month post-onset demonstrated normalized CBF in the affected areas. Our study suggests that vascular event underlies the migrainous aura in this case and secondarily provokes a loss of inhibitory control of the motor thalamus resulting in the manifestation of hemichorea.

N2  -  Background and Objective. Cerebral gliomas have a tendency to infiltrate the surrounding brain tissue for several centimeters from the core of tumor. The usefulness of structural magnetic resonance (MR) sequences is limited because of their insensitivity for the detection of tumor cells outside the visible tumor border. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity and the repeatability of 2 functional MR methods: fractional anisotropy (FA) and spectroscopy in the assessment of the peritumoral area of cerebral gliomas.
Material and Methods. Forty-five patients with histologically verified brain gliomas underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS). Metabolic ratios were calculated from choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), lactatelipids (LL), myo-inositol (MI) spectroscopic values obtained within the tumor center, perifocal edema, and distant and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. DTI maps of FA were calculated at the same locations.; Results. A significant gradual increase of FA and a decrease of LLCr ratios from the tumor center to the normal-appearing white matter were observed. The ChoCr ratio was significantly lower in the distant normal-appearing white matter than in the perifocal edema and the tumor center. The NAACr ratio was significantly reduced in the tumor center, perifocal edema, and distant normal-appearing white matter compared with the contralateral hemisphere. MRS and DTI measurements of glioma and peritumoral area had a high degree of repeatability.; Conclusions. Our study shows that MRS and DTI measurements are reproducible. The combined use of ChoCr, LLCr, and FA measurements is a promising MR technique that provides valuable additional information about the location of glioma potential border.

N2  -  Introduction Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. This contact sport carries the risk of exposure to repeated head impacts in the form of subconcussions, defined as minimal brain injuries following head impact, with no symptom of concussion. While it has been suggested that exposure to repetitive subconcussive events can result in long-term neurophysiological modifications, and the later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the consequences of these repeated impacts remain controversial and largely unexplored in the context of soccer players. Methods and analysis This is a prospective, single-centre, exposure/non-exposure, transverse study assessing the MRI and neuropsychological abnormalities in professional retired soccer players exposed to subconcussive impacts, compared with high-level athletes not exposed to head impacts. The primary outcome corresponds to the results of MRI by advanced MRI techniques (diffusion tensor, cerebral perfusion, functional MRI, cerebral volumetry and cortical thickness, spectroscopy, susceptibility imaging). Secondary outcomes are the results of the neuropsychological tests: number of errors and time to complete tests. We hypothesise that repeated subconcussive impacts could lead to morphological lesions and impact on soccer players' cognitive skills in the long term. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained and the study was approved by the Comite de Protection des Personnes (CPP) No 2021-A01169-32. Study findings will be disseminated by publication in a high-impact international journal. Results will be presented at national and international imaging meetings.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW

N2  -  Non-invasive imaging biomarkers are useful for prognostication in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at high risk for morbidity with invasive procedures. The authors present findings from a scoping review discussing the pertinent biomarkers. Embase, Ovid-MEDLINE, and Scopus were queried for original research on imaging biomarkers for prognostication of TBI in adult patients. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. Data was synthesized and confidence evaluated with the linked evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Our search yielded 3104 unique citations, 44 of which were included in this review. Study populations varied in TBI severity, as defined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), including: mild (n=9), mild and moderate (n=3), moderate and severe (n=7), severe (n=6), and all GCS scores (n=17). Diverse imaging modalities were used for prognostication, predominantly computed tomography (CT) only (n=11), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only (n=9), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (N=9). The biomarkers included diffusion coefficient mapping, metabolic characteristics, optic nerve sheath diameter, T1-weighted signal changes, cortical cerebral blood flow, axial versus extra-axial lesions, T2-weighted gradient versus spin echo, translocator protein levels, and trauma imaging of brainstem areas. The majority (93%) of studies identified that the imaging biomarker of interest had a statistically significant prognostic value; however, these are based on a very low to low level of quality of evidence. No study directly compared the effects on specific TBI treatments on the temporal course of imaging biomarkers. The current literature is insufficient to make a strong recommendation about a preferred imaging biomarker for TBI, especially considering GRADE criteria revealing low quality of evidence. Rigorous prospective research of imaging biomarkers of TBI is warranted to improve the understanding of TBI severity.

N2  -  Heart failure (HF) patients show gray and white matter changes in multiple brain sites, including autonomic and motor coordination areas. It is unclear whether the changes represent acute or chronic tissue pathology, a distinction necessary for understanding pathological processes that can be resolved with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based mean diffusivity (MD) procedures. We collected four DTI series from 16 HF (age 55.1 +/- 7.8 years, 12 male) and 26 control (49.7 +/- 10.8 years, 17 male) subjects with a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. MD maps were realigned, averaged, normalized, and smoothed. Global and regional MD values from autonomic and motor coordination sites were calculated by using normalized MD maps and brain masks; group MD values and whole-brain smoothed MD maps were compared by analysis of covariance (covariates; age and gender). Global brain MD (HF vs. controls, units x 10(-6) mm(2)/sec, 1103.8 +/- 76.6 vs. 1035.9 +/- 69.4, P=0.038) and regional autonomic and motor control site values (left insula, 1,085.4 +/- 95.7 vs. 975.7 +/- 65.4, P=0.001; right insula, 1,050.2 +/- 100.6 vs. 965.7 +/- 58.4, P=0.004; left hypothalamus, 1,419.6 +/- 165.2 vs. 1,234.9 +/- 136.3, P=0.002; right hypothalamus, 1,446.5 +/- 178.8 vs. 1,273.3 +/- 136.9, P=0.004; left cerebellar cortex, 889.1 +/- 81.9 vs. 796.6 +/- 46.8, P<0.001; right cerebellar cortex, 797.8 +/- 50.8 vs. 750.3 +/- 27.5, P=0.001; cerebellar deep nuclei, 1,236.1 +/- 193.8 vs. 1,071.7 +/- 107.1, P=0.002) were significantly higher in HF vs. control subjects, indicating chronic tissue changes. Whole-brain comparisons showed increased MD values in HF subjects, including limbic, basal-ganglia, thalamic, solitary tract nucleus, frontal, and cerebellar regions. Brain injury occurs in autonomic and motor control areas, which may contribute to deficient function in HF patients. The chronic tissue changes likely result from processes that develop over a prolonged period. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) abnormalities in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are currently measured by a complex combination of separate procedures. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide a reliable method for reducing analysis complexity and obtaining reproducible results.
Methods: We implemented a semi-automated measuring system in which different well-known software components for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis are integrated to obtain reliable measurements of DWI and PWI disturbances in MS.; Results: We generated the DiffusionPerfusion Project (DPP) Suite, in which a series of external software programs are managed and harmonically and hierarchically incorporated by in-house developed Matlab software to perform the following processes: 1) image pre-processing, including imaging data anonymization and conversion from DICOM to Nifti format; 2) co-registration of 2D and 3D non-enhanced and Gd-enhanced T1-weighted images in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) space; 3) lesion segmentation and classification, in which FLAIR lesions are at first segmented and then categorized according to their presumed evolution; 4) co-registration of segmented FLAIR lesion in T1 space to obtain the FLAIR lesion mask in the T1 space; 5) normal appearing tissue segmentation, in which T1 lesion mask is used to segment basal gangliathalami, normal appearing grey matter (NAGM) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM); 6) DWI and PWI map generation; 7) co-registration of basal gangliathalami, NAGM, NAWM, DWI and PWI maps in previously segmented FLAIR space; 8) data analysis. All these steps are automatic, except for lesion segmentation and classification.; Conclusion: We developed a promising method to limit misclassifications and user errors, providing clinical researchers with a practical and reproducible tool to measure DWI and PWI changes in MS.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Multiparametric MRI generates different zones within the lesion that may reflect heterogeneity of tissue damage in cerebral ischemia. This study presents the application of a novel model of tissue characterization based on an angular separation between tissues obtained with the use of an objective (unsupervised) computer segmentation algorithm implementing a modified version of the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). We test the utility of this model to identify ischemic tissue in clinical stroke.
Methods-MR parameters diffusion-, T2-, and T1-weighted imaging (DWI, T2WI, and T1WI, respectively) were obtained from 10 patients at 3 time points (30 studies) after stroke: acute (less than or equal to 12 hours), subacute (3 to 5 days), and chronic (3 months). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was measured, and volumes were obtained from the ISODATA, DWI, and T2WI maps on patients at each time point.; Results-The acute (less than or equal to 12 hours) multiparametric ISODATA volume was significantly correlated with the acute (less than or equal to 12 hours) DWI (r=0.96. P <0.05; n=10) and chronic (3 months) T2WI volume (r=0.69, P <0.05; n=10). The ISODATA-defined tissue regions exhibited MR indices consistent with ischemic andor infarcted tissue at each time point. The acute (less than or equal to 12 hours) multiparametric ISODATA volumes were significantly correlated (r=0.82, P <0.009; 10) with the final NIHSS score. In comparison, the acute (less than or equal to 12 hours) DWI volumes were less correlated (p =0.77, P <0.05; n=10) and T2WI volume (less than or equal to 12h) exhibited a marginal correlation (r=0.66, P <0.05; n=10) with the final NIHSS score.; Conclusions-The integrated ISODATA approach to tissue segmentation and classification discriminated abnormal from normal tissue at each time point. The ISODATA volume was significantly correlated with the current MR standards used in the clinical setting and the 3-month clinical status of the patient.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether tumoral and peritumoral apparent diffusion coefficient values and intratumoral susceptibility signals on susceptibility-weighted imaging could distinguish between high-grade gliomas and brain metastases, and to investigate their associations with the Ki-67 proliferation index.
Materials and methods: Fifty-seven patients with pathologically confirmed diagnoses of either high-grade glioma or brain metastasis were enrolled in this study (23 with high-grade gliomas and 34 with brain metastases). The minimum and mean apparent diffusion coefficients in the enhancing tumoral region (ADC(min) and ADC(mean)) and the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient in the peritumoral region (ADC(edema)) were measured from apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and intratumoral susceptibility signal grades acquired by susceptibility-weighted imaging were calculated. Ki-67 proliferation index values were obtained from the hospital database. These parameters were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test, independent-sample Hest, Spearman correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve, and logistic regression analyses.; Results: ADC(mean) ADC(min) values, and intratumoral susceptibility signal grades in brain metastases were significantly lower than those in high-grade gliomas (all p< 0.05). Ki-67 proliferation index values showed significant correlations with ADC(mean )ADC(min), and intratumoral susceptibility signal grade in brain metastases (all p< 0.05), but no correlation was found in high-grade gliomas (all p> 0.05). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, ADC(mean) achieved the highest diagnostic performance for discriminating high-grade gliomas from brain metastases. Furthermore, the combination of tumoral apparent diffusion coefficient parameters with intratumoral susceptibility signal grade provided a higher area under the curve than univariate parameters.; Conclusion: The combination of tumoral apparent diffusion coefficient with intratumoral susceptibility signal grade can offer better diagnostic performances for differential diagnosis. Apparent diffusion coefficient and intratumoral susceptibility signal may reflect cellular proliferative activity in brain metastases, but not in high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Simple Summary For brain tumor patients, surgeons must resect as much of the tumor as possible while preserving the patient's function and quality of life. This requires preoperative imaging that accurately identifies important parts of the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a way of preoperatively finding the areas of the brain connected to motor function. However, few studies have investigated the accuracy and clinical relevance of the data. In this study, we examine the functional outcomes of patients who had TMS points resected and patients who did not. We aim to address key technical barriers to performing this analysis. We also aim to discern the appropriate role of TMS tractography in preoperative diagnostic imaging. Insights gained from this study can be used to select the right patients and plan for the optimal surgeries. Surgeons must optimize the onco-functional balance by maximizing the extent of resection and minimizing postoperative neurological morbidity. Optimal patient selection and surgical planning requires preoperative identification of nonresectable structures. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a method of noninvasively mapping the cortical representations of the speech and motor systems. Despite recent promising data, its clinical relevance and appropriate role in a comprehensive mapping approach remains unknown. In this study, we aim to provide direct evidence regarding the clinical utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation by interrogating the eloquence of TMS points. Forty-two glioma patients were included in this retrospective study. We collected motor function outcomes 3 months postoperatively. We overlayed the postoperative MRI onto the preoperative MRI to visualize preoperative TMS points in the context of the surgical cavity. We then generated diffusion tensor imaging tractography to identify meaningful subsets of TMS points. We correlated the resection of preoperative imaging features with clinical outcomes. The resection of TMS-positive points was significantly predictive of permanent deficits (p = 0.05). However, four out of eight patients had TMS-positive points resected without a permanent deficit. DTI tractography at a 75% FA threshold identified which TMS points are essential and which are amenable to surgical resection. TMS combined with DTI tractography shows a significant prediction of postoperative neurological deficits with both a high positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

N2  -  Deep white matter hemorrhagic venous infarction with subsequent cavitation due to necrosis and liquefaction has been described in neonates and may be associated with infection and meningitis. In our experience, the MRI pattern of these lesions is confused with the pattern seen with cerebral abscesses.
The purpose of our study was to characterize the MRI findings of post infarction necrosis and liquefaction after hemorrhagic deep white matter venous infarction in infants and to distinguish these lesions from cerebral abscesses.; An institutional review board approved a retrospective review of imaging records to identify all patients with cerebral venous infarction at a children's hospital during a 10-year period. Nine infants had deep white matter hemorrhagic venous infarction with white matter fluid signal cavitary lesions. A diagnosis of cerebral abscess was considered in all. The imaging and laboratory findings in these patients are reviewed and compared to descriptions of abscesses found in the literature.; There were six female and three male infants. The mean age at presentation was 20 days (range: 0-90 days), while the corrected age at presentation was less than 30 days for all patients. Seven patients presented with seizures and signs of infection; one infant presented with lethargy and later proved to have protein C deficiency. MRI was performed 0-12 days from presentation in these eight patients. Another patient with known protein C deficiency underwent MRI at 30 days for follow-up of screening US abnormalities. There were a total of 38 deep cerebral white matter fluid signal cavitary lesions: 25 frontal, 9 parietal, 2 temporal, 2 occipital. Larger lesions had dependent debris. All lesions had associated hemorrhage and many lesions had evidence of adjacent small vessel venous thrombosis. Lesions imaged after gadolinium showed peripheral enhancement. Three lesions increased in size on follow-up imaging. Three patients, two with meningitis confirmed via microbiology and one with presumed meningitis by CSF counts, underwent surgical aspiration of a total of six lesions. All specimens were sent for pathology and culture and were negative for microorganisms.; Recognizing the MR appearance of cavitary necrosis and liquefaction after deep white matter cerebral venous infarction in neonates can distinguish this entity from cerebral abscess and potentially avoid an unnecessary neurosurgical aspiration procedure.

N2  -  Background: Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) lesions are known to be present in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, it is not easy to distinguish these lesions from others in MRI. This study aimed to investigate the most useful value for estimating NAWM damage using fractional anisotropy (FA) histograms analysis. Methods: Data from patients with relapsing-remitting MS and healthy controls were analyzed using a 1.5T MRI system with SENSE-Head-8 coil. FA maps with diffusion weighted images were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence. The median, standard deviation (SD), kurtosis, and skewness of white matter (WM) of each subject were compared between MS and healthy controls using an in-house application. Results: FA decrease in 8 patients with MS was observed upon comparison with 12 controls and leaned toward the left side. While the SDs of the healthy controls were not significantly different from those of patients with MS, patients with MS expressed significantly lower median values, and higher kurtosis and skewness compared to healthy controls. A trend for inverse associations existed between median and expanded disability status scale scores. Conclusion: Our data suggests that median FA values can allow for distinguishing between patients with MS and healthy controls with high accuracy.

N2  -  This study noninvasively examined the electrical conductivity (sigma) characteristics of diffuse gliomas using MRI and tested its validity.
MRI including a 3D steady-state free precession (3D SSFP) sequence was performed on 30 glioma patients. The sigma maps were reconstructed from the phase images of the 3D SSFP sequence. The sigma histogram metrics were extracted and compared among the contrast-enhanced (CET) and noncontrast-enhanced tumour components (NCET) and normal brain parenchyma (NP). Difference in tumour sigma histogram metrics among tumour grades and correlation of sigma metrics with tumour grades were tested. Validity of sigma measurement using this technique was tested by correlating the mean tumour sigma values measured using MRI with those measured ex vivo using a dielectric probe.; Several sigma histogram metrics of CET and NCET of diffuse gliomas were significantly higher than NP (Bonferroni-corrected p ae<currency> .045). The maximum sigma of NCET showed a moderate positive correlation with tumour grade (r = .571, Bonferroni-corrected p = .018). The mean tumour sigma measured using MRI showed a moderate positive correlation with the sigma measured ex vivo (r = .518, p = .040).; Tissue sigma can be evaluated using MRI, incorporation of which may better characterise diffuse gliomas.; aEuro cent This study tested the validity of noninvasive electrical conductivity measurements by MRI.; aEuro cent This study also evaluated the electrical conductivity characteristics of diffuse glioma.; aEuro cent Gliomas have higher electrical conductivity values than the normal brain parenchyma.; aEuro cent Noninvasive electrical conductivity measurement can be helpful for better characterisation of glioma.

N2  -  Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) associated with thin corpus callosum is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an abnormally thin corpus callosum, normal motor development, slowly progressive spastic paraparesis and cognitive deterioration. To investigate and localize abnormalities in the brains of two Chinese patients with HSP-TCC, with mutations in the spatacsin gene. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to determine the mean diffusion (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of the patients in comparison to 20 healthy subjects. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) of both the diffusion and anisotropy values were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Significant changes with MD increase and FA reduction were found in the already known lesions including the corpus callosum, cerebellum and thalamus. In addition, changes were also found in regions that appear to be normal in conventional MRI, such as the brain stem, internal capsule, cingulum and subcortical white matter including superior longitudinal fascicle and inferior longitudinal fascicle. Neither increase in FA nor reduction in MD was detected in the brain. Our study provides clear in vivo MR imaging evidence of a more widespread brain involvement of HSP-TCC. MD is more sensitive than FA in detecting lesions in thalamus and subcortical white matter, suggesting that MD may be a better marker of the disease progression. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  ObjectivesTo comprehensively evaluate the glioma using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM).Materials and methodsForty-two patients (18 women; mean age, 45 years) with pathologically confirmed gliomas were retrospectively included. All the patients underwent conventional and advanced MRI examinations (QSM, DWI, MRS, etc.). Five patients underwent paired QSM (pre- and post-enhancement). Four Visually Accessible Rembrandt Image (VASARI) features and intratumoural susceptibility signal (ITSS) were observed. Three ROIs each were manually drawn separately in the tumour parenchyma with relatively high and low magnetic susceptibility. The association between the tumour's magnetic susceptibility and other MRI parameters was also analysed.ResultsMorphologically, gliomas with heterogeneous ITSS were more similar to high-grade gliomas (p = 0.006, AUC: 0.72, sensitivity: 70%, and specificity: 73%). Heterogeneous ITSS was significantly associated with tumour haemorrhage, necrosis, diffusion restriction, and avid enhancement but did not change between pre- and post-enhanced QSM. Quantitatively, tumour parenchyma magnetic susceptibility had limited value in grading gliomas and identifying IDH mutation status, whereas the relatively low magnetic susceptibility of the tumour parenchyma helped identify oligodendrogliomas in IDH mutated gliomas (AUC = 0.78) with high specificity (100%). The relatively high tumour magnetic susceptibility significantly increased after enhancement (p = 0.039). Additionally, we found that the magnetic susceptibility of the tumour parenchyma was significantly correlated with ADC (r = 0.61) and Cho/NAA (r = 0.40).ConclusionsQSM is a promising candidate for the comprehensive evaluation of gliomas, except for IDH mutation status. The magnetic susceptibility of tumour parenchyma may be affected by tumour cell proliferation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Histopathologic grade of glial tumors is inversely correlated with the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). We assessed the diagnostic values of minimum ADC for preoperative grading of supratentorial astrocytomas that were diagnosed as low-grade astrocytomas on conventional MR imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 118 patients with astrocytomas (WHO grades II-IV), 16 who showed typical MR imaging findings of low-grade supratentorial astrocytomas on conventional MR imaging were included. All 16 patients underwent preoperative MR imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. The minimum ADC value of each tumor was determined from several regions of interest in the tumor on ADC maps. To assess the relationship between the minimum ADC and tumor grade, we performed the Mann-Whitney U test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the cutoff value of the minimum ADC that had the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing low- and high-grade astrocytomas.; RESULTS: Eight of the 16 patients (50%) were confirmed as having high-grade astrocytomas (WHO grades III and IV), and the other 8 patients were confirmed as having low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade 11). The median minimum ADC of the high-grade astrocytoma (1.035 x 10(-3) mm(2) . sec(-1)) group was significantly lower than that of the low-grade astrocytoma group (1.19 x 10(-3) mm(2) . sec(-1)) (P = .021). According to the ROC analysis, the cutoff value of 1.055 x 10(-3) mm(2) . sec(-1) for the minimum ADC generated the best combination of sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (79%) (P = 021).; CONCLUSION: Measuring minimum ADC can provide valuable diagnostic information for the preoperative grading of presumptive low-grade supratentorial astrocytomas.

N2  -  Nowadays, automatic tumor detection from brain images is extremely significant for many diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes, due to the unpredictable shape and appearance of tumors. In medical image analysis, the automatic segmentation of tumors from brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is the most critical issue. Existing research has some limitations, such as high processing time and lower accuracy, because of the time required for the training process. In this research, a new automatic segmentation process is introduced using machine learning and a swarm intelligence scheme. Here, a fuzzy logic with spiking neuron model (FL-SNM) is proposed for segmenting the brain tumor region in MR images. Initially, input images are preprocessed to remove Gaussian and Poisson noise using a modified Kuan filter (MKF). In the MKF, the optimal selection of the minimum MSE of image pixels is achieved using a random search algorithm (RSA), which improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Then, the image is smoothed using an anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF) to reduce the over-filtering problem. Afterwards, to extract statistical texture features, Fisher's linear-discriminant analysis (FLDA) is used. Finally, extracted features are transferred to the FL-SNM process and this scheme effectively segments the tumor region. In FL-SNM, the consequent parameters such as weight and bias play an important role in segmenting the region. Therefore, optimizing the weight parameter values using a chicken behavior-based swarm intelligence (CSI) algorithm, is proposed. The proposed (FL-SNM) scheme attained better performance in terms of high accuracy (94.87%), sensitivity (92.07%), specificity (99.34%), precision rate (89.36%), recall rate (88.39%), F-measure (95.06%), G-mean (95.63%), and DSC rate (91.2%), compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hierarchical self-organizing maps (HSOMs).

N2  -  Postmortem brain of a ten-month-old child was examined by MR imaging, and diffusion MR imaging at the 12th hour after death in order to disclose the cause of death. There were basal ganglion lesions indicating a mitochondrial disorder. There was a prominent difference between the ADC values of the white matter (0.28+/-0.04x10(-3)mm(2)/s) and cortex (0.42+/-0.04x10(-3)mm(2)/S), and this was statistically significant (p<0.0001). This difference suggested that in the postmortem brain the conditions in the white matter leading to restriction of movement of water molecules are more severe than that in the cortex.

N2  -  The technique of fiber tracking based on diffusion tensor imaging offers the unique possibility of localizing the white matter pathways of the brain in vivo. In patients with cerebral tumors or space-occupying lesions of the brain, these pathways are often damaged or significantly displaced. Knowledge of the exact location of the lesion with respect to clinically eloquent white matter pathways is of great value to the neurosurgeon in planning the appropriate surgical strategy. We present here preliminary findings using the fiber tracking technique in four patients with space-occupying lesions and discuss the potential and limitations of the technique for lesion localization and neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  In humans, intracranial hematomas commonly exhibit a T2 blackout effect (BOE) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Published descriptions of comparable findings in dogs with intracerebral hemorrhages are lacking. Aims of this retrospective observational study were to describe the appearance of presumed intracerebral hemorrhages (PICHs) in DWI regardless of the underlying etiology and presence of T2 blackout effect (T2 BOE) in dogs and to test potential associations with DWI and ADC findings versus the estimated age of the hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of dogs with presumed PICHs based on the combined evaluation of T2*W gradient echo and/or susceptibility-weighted imaging, T1W and T2W images were enrolled. The age of the hemorrhage was estimated according to published criteria based on T1W and T2W sequences. The association between the age of the hemorrhage and the appearance of each finding (stratified or mixed), their signal intensities in DWI/ADC and the presence of the T2 BOE, was evaluated. A total of 35 PICHs were included: 13 of them were stratified and 22 had a mixed aspect. Only the ADC appearance of the peripheral layer in stratified PICHs was significantly associated with estimated age of the hemorrhage (p = .033), being hypointense in all hyperacute cases and hypo-/isointense in acute cases. The T2 BOE was present in 29/35 PICHs. The DWI sequences showed limited utility to date PICHs in this study population. As in humans, the T2 BOE was commonly seen in DWI and ADC maps of dogs with PICHs.

T2  -  FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE

N2  -  In recent years, a paradigm shift in neuroscience has been occurring from "localizationism," or the idea that the brain is organized into separately functioning modules, toward "connectomics," or the idea that interconnected nodes form networks as the underlying substrates of behavior and thought. Accordingly, our understanding of mechanisms of neurological function, dysfunction, and recovery has evolved to include connections, disconnections, and reconnections. Brain tumors provide a unique opportunity to probe large-scale neural networks with focal and sometimes reversible lesions, allowing neuroscientists the unique opportunity to directly test newly formed hypotheses about underlying brain structural-functional relationships and network properties. Moreover, if a more complete model of neurological dysfunction is to be defined as a "disconnectome," potential avenues for recovery might be mapped through a "reconnectome." Such insight may open the door to novel therapeutic approaches where previous attempts have failed. In this review, we briefly delve into the most clinically relevant neural networks and brain mapping techniques, and we examine how they are being applied to modern neurosurgical brain tumor practices. We then explore how brain tumors might teach us more about mechanisms of global brain dysfunction and recovery through pre- and postoperative longitudinal connectomic and behavioral analyses.

N2  -  The application of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has certainly helped to improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for clinical disability and cognitive impairment in this condition.
The numerous studies performed in MS patients have also provided many lessons on the structure-function relationships in the human brain, which could be applied to healthy subjects and to patients affected by other neurological conditions. The findings have allowed a better understanding of the processes involved in the loss of function after central nervous system (CNS) damage, and clarified the substrates of specific symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment and fatigue), which should aid clinical recovery and help in the monitoring of disease progression.; In this review, important examples of how the application of different MRI techniques in MS might provide relevant information on the human brain are discussed. These include how damage to strategic white matter tracts can cause symptoms due to a disconnection mechanism and how involvement of a specific brain network, independent of the underlying pathological substrate, might determine certain symptoms. The role of functional and structural plasticity in clinical recovery (following an acute relapse or promoted by rehabilitation) and the mechanisms that might become the target of treatment aimed at function recovery are also considered. The ways in which network- and system-based analysis can reshape current understanding of the brain structure-function relationships are discussed. Finally, there is speculation about the relevance of inherited or acquired factors, such as age, comorbidity, brain reserve and cognitive reserve, which are likely to influence the relation between CNS damage and disease clinical manifestations.

N2  -  Background: Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom following stroke, but its underlying mechanisms are unknown. Associations with a number of imaging features have been proposed.
Aims: We aimed to assess whether neuroimaging parameters could better inform our understanding of possible causes of post-stroke fatigue (PSF) through systematic review and meta-analysis.; Methods: Using a predefined protocol registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022303168), we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsycInfo for studies assessing PSF and computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We extracted neuroimaging parameters and narratively analyzed study results to assess any association with PSF. Where there were 3+ similar studies, we carried out a meta-analysis using inverse-variance random-effects model to estimate the total association of each neuroimaging parameter on PSF. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle and Ottawa Scale.; Results: We identified 46 studies (N = 6543); in many studies, associations with fatigue were secondary or subanalyses (28.3%). Imaging parameters were assessed across eight variables: lesion lateralization, lesion location, lesion volume, brain atrophy, infarct number, cerebral microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and network measures. Most variables showed no conclusive evidence for any association with fatigue. Meta-analysis, where possible, showed no association of the following with PSF; left lesion lateralization (OR: 0.88, 95% CI (0.64, 1. 22) (p = 0.45)), infratentorial lesion location (OR: 1.83, 95% CI (0.63, 5.32) (p = 0.27)), and WMH (OR: 1.21, 95% CI (0.84, 1.75) (p = 0.29)). Many studies assessed lesion location with mixed findings; only one used voxel-symptom lesion-mapping (VSLM). Some small studies suggested an association between altered functional brain networks, namely frontal, fronto-striato-thalamic, and sensory processing networks, with PSF.; Conclusion: There was little evidence for the association between any neuroimaging parameters and PSF. Future studies should utilize advanced imaging techniques to fully understand the role of lesion location in PSF, while the role of altered brain networks in mediating PSF merits further research.

N2  -  Background: Surgical planning with nTMS-based tractography is proven to increase safety during surgery. A preoperative risk stratification model has been published based on the M1 infiltration, RMT ratio, and tumor to corticospinal tract distance (TTD). The correlation of TTD with corticospinal tract to resection cavity distance (TRD) and outcome is needed to further evaluate the validity of the model. Aim of the study: To use the postop MRI-derived resection cavity to measure how closely the resection cavity approximated the preoperatively calculated corticospinal tract (CST) and how this correlates with the risk model and the outcome. Methods: We included 183 patients who underwent nTMS-based DTI and surgical resection for presumed motor-eloquent gliomas. TTD, TRD, and motor outcome were recorded and tested for correlations. The intraoperative monitoring documentation was available for a subgroup of 48 patients, whose responses were correlated to TTD and TRD. Results: As expected, TTD and TRD showed a good correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.67, p < 0.001). Both the TTD and the TRD correlated significantly with the motor outcome at three months (Kendall's Tau-b 0.24 for TTD, 0.31 for TRD, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the TTD and TRD correlated only slightly with residual tumor volume, and only after correction for outliers related to termination of resection due to intraoperative monitoring events or the proximity of other eloquent structures (TTD rho = 0.32, p < 0.001; TRD rho = 0.19, p = 0.01). This reflects the fact that intraoperative monitoring (IOM) phenomena do not always correlate with preoperative structural analysis, and that additional factors influence the intraoperative decision to abort resection, such as the adjacency of other vulnerable structures. The TTD was also significantly correlated with variations in motor evoked potential (MEP) responses (no/reversible decrease vs. irreversible decrease; p = 0.03). Conclusions: The TTD approximates the TRD well, confirming the best predictive parameter and giving strength to the nTMS-based risk stratification model. Our analysis of TRD supports the use of the nTMS-based TTD measurement to estimate the resection preoperatively, also confirming the 8 mm cutoff. Nevertheless, the TRD proved to have a slightly stronger correlation with the outcome as the surgeon's experience, anatomofunctional knowledge, and MEP observations influence the expected EOR.

N2  -  IntroductionOptic radiations are tracts of particular interest for neurosurgery, especially for temporal lobe resection, because their lesion is responsible for visual field defects. However, histological and MRI studies found a high inter-subject variability of the optic radiation anatomy, especially for their most rostral extent inside the Meyer's temporal loop. We aimed to better assess inter-subject anatomical variability of the optic radiations, in order to help to reduce the risk of postoperative visual field deficiencies.MethodsUsing an advanced analysis pipeline relying on a whole-brain probabilistic tractography and fiber clustering, we processed the diffusion MRI data of the 1065 subjects of the HCP cohort. After registration in a common space, a cross-subject clustering on the whole cohort was performed to reconstruct the reference optic radiation bundle, from which all optic radiations were segmented on an individual scale.ResultsWe found a median distance between the rostral tip of the temporal pole and the rostral tip of the optic radiation of 29.2 mm (standard deviation: 2.1 mm) for the right side and 28.8 mm (standard deviation: 2.3 mm) for the left side. The difference between both hemispheres was statistically significant (p = 1.10(-8)).ConclusionWe demonstrated inter-individual variability of the anatomy of the optic radiations on a large-scale study, especially their rostral extension. In order to better guide neurosurgical procedures, we built a MNI-based reference atlas of the optic radiations that can be used for fast optic radiation reconstruction from any individual diffusion MRI tractography.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Optimizing scan parameters for double inversion recovery (DIR) sequences remains difficult.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new method for optimizing DIR sequence scan parameters using T1 mapping and a newly developed analysis algorithm.; METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers underwent T1 mapping and DIR magnetic resonance imaging. The following steps were used for image optimization including: 1) measurement of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) T1 values to create a T1 map; 2) calculation of optimized scan parameters by using a developed analysis algorithm; 3) performance assessment of DIR magnetic resonance imaging by using the calculated optimized imaging parameters. Additionally, we used scan parameters from previous studies to obtain DIR images in order to evaluate our new method. The contrast between GM and suppressed tissues was compared between these images and those obtained using the optimized parameters.; RESULTS: Using our optimization method, WM and CSF regions were suppressed uniformly for all scan conditions. The contrast was significantly higher in images obtained using this optimization method compared to those obtained using previously published parameters (p < 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to obtain superior DIR images by using an optimization method that involves T1 mapping and a newly developed analysis algorithm.

N2  -  High-grade gliomas are an aggressive and invasive malignancy which are susceptible to treatment resistance due to heterogeneity in intratumoral properties such as cell proliferation and density and perfusion. Non-invasive imaging approaches can measure these properties, which can then be used to calibrate patient-specific mathematical models of tumor growth and response. We employed multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify tumor extent (via contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted, and T-2-FLAIR) and capture intratumoral heterogeneity in cell density (via diffusion-weighted imaging) to calibrate a family of mathematical models of chemoradiation response in nine patients with unresected or partially resected disease. The calibrated model parameters were used to forecast spatially-mapped individual tumor response at future imaging visits. We then employed the Akaike information criteria to select the most parsimonious member from the family, a novel two-species model describing the enhancing and non-enhancing components of the tumor. Using this model, we achieved low error in predictions of the enhancing volume (median: - 2.5%, interquartile range: 10.0%) and a strong correlation in total cell count (Kendall correlation coefficient 0.79) at 3-months post-treatment. These preliminary results demonstrate the plausibility of using multiparametric MRI data to inform spatially-informative, biologically-based predictive models of tumor response in the setting of clinical high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Objectives: To study the incompletely understood sympathoexcitatory pathway through the human brain stem, using a new method of three dimensional brain stem mapping on the basis of digitally postprocessed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: 258 consecutive patients presenting with acute signs of brain stem ischaemia underwent biplane T2 and EPI diffusion weighted MRI, with slice orientation parallel and perpendicular to a transversal slice selection of the stereotactic anatomical atlas of Schaltenbrand and Wahren, 1977. The individual slices were digitally normalised and projected onto the appropriate slices of the anatomical atlas. For correlation analysis lesions were imported into a three dimensional model of the human brain stem.; Results: 31 of the 258 patients had Horner's syndrome caused by acute brain stem ischaemia. Only four of the patients with Horner's syndrome had pontine infarctions, 12 had pontomedullary lesions, and 15 had medullary lesions. Correlation analysis showed significantly affected voxels in the dorsolateral medulla but not in the pons. A statistical comparison with infarct topology in patients with medullary lesions but without Horner's syndrome indicated that involvement of the medial and ventral part of affected voxels located in the ventrolateral medullary tegmentum was specific for Horner's syndrome.; Conclusions: Based on this first in vivo topodiagnostic study, the central sympathoexcitatory pathway probably descends through the dorsal pons before converging on specific generators in the ventrolateral medullary tegmentum at a level below the IX and X nerve exits.

N2  -  The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiotherapy treatment planning (RTP) is increasing due to excellent tissue contrast and high-resolution images compared to other modalities. However, the issue of image inhomogeneity which affects tissue delineation and contrast during treatment planning needs to be resolved. This study is aimed to qualitatively observe image inhomogeneity in T-2-weighted images and T-2 measurement using head phantom. Agar hydrogel phantom of various concentrations were used to form inhomogeneous phantom for mimicking tissue variation in the brain in addition to American College of Radiology accredited phantom. T-2 images from both phantoms were obtained using fast spin echo sequence with variation of echo time (TE) and repetition time. Image processing was processed to obtain signal intensity and image mapping and the effect of inhomogeneity was observed qualitatively. T-2 values were obtained by fitting signal intensity against TE and T-2-mapping images were obtained. T-2-weighted and T-2-mapping images from the experiment provided qualitative description on image inhomogeneity and contrast. The result showed that T-2-mapping images offered more information on phantom properties and described image inhomogeneity and contrast better than T-2-weighted images. T-2 measurement provided an alternative method for better description of image contrast which could enhance localization and tissue delineation in MRI-based RTP.

N2  -  Purpose: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers.
Methods: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression.; Results: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001.; Conclusions: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure. These findings encourage further studies with a larger patient cohort. (C) 2014 Author(s).

N2  -  Background Lesions within the primary motor cortex (M1) and the corticospinal tract (CST) represent a significant surgical challenge with a delicate functional trade-off that should be integrated in the overall patient-centered treatment plan.
Methods Patients with lesions within the M1 and CST with preoperative cortical and subcortical mapping (navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation nTMS and tractography), intraoperative mapping, and intraoperative provisional histologic information (smear with and without 5-aminolevulinic acid 5-ALA) were included. This independently acquired information was integrated in a decision-making process model to determine the intraoperative extent of resection.; Results A total of 10 patients (6 patients with metastatic precentral tumor; 1 patient with grade III and 2 patients with grade IV gliomas; 1 patient with precentral cavernoma) were included in the study. Most of the patients (60%) had a preoperative motor deficit. The nTMS documented M1 invasion in all cases, and in eight patients, the lesions were embedded within the CST. Overall, 70% of patients underwent gross total resection; 20% of patients underwent near-total resection of the lesions. In only one patient was no surgical resection possible after both preoperative and intraoperative mapping. Overall, 70% of patients remained stable postoperatively, and previous motor weakness improved in 20%.; Conclusion The independently acquired anatomical (anatomical MRI) and functional (nTMS and tractography) tests in patients with CST lesions provide a useful guide for resection. The inclusion of histologic information (smear with or without 5-ALA) further allows the surgical team to balance the potential functional risks within the global treatment plan. Therefore, the patient is kept at the center of the informed decision-making process.

N2  -  Pseudoprogression (PP) is a diagnostic dilemma in the follow-up of brain high grade gliomas (HGG), and the introduction of new therapies has further complicated its identification in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We report a case of pseudoprogression after intraoperative radiotherapy (ioRT) and Regorafenib therapy in a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma recurrence. A 55-year-old man, treated in August 2017 for a right frontal anaplastic astrocytoma, with surgical resection and following radiotherapy and Temozolomide, in October 2019 was again treated for peri-surgical bed recurrence with resection and ioRT followed by Regorafenib therapy, interrupted in February 2020, after the onset of adverse reactions. MRI examination showed a large irregular alteration posterior to the surgical bed, T2 weighted hypointense featuring strong diffusion restriction (low ADC values), with an irregular contrast-enhancement (CE) pattern, and surrounded by a vast vasogenic oedema; Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging (PWI) showed no increase of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). Particularly, lesion appeared markedly hypointense and dusty-like on susceptibility weighted images (SWI) probably due to a constant hemorrhagic diapedesis promoted by Regorafenib. Therefore, pseudoprogression was suspected. Follow-up MRI exams showed gradual reduction of SWI and CE abnormalities, but a persistent DWI restriction. Unfortunately, the last MRI control showed a secondary cerebellar localisation of the disease. New therapies are changing MRI pattern in HGG imaging and this case underlines how a multimodality approach is increasingly necessary. In particular, when using anti-VEGF drugs, SWI can have a crucial role in identifying therapy-related haemorrhagic changes.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives. We introduce a new approach to the prediction of final infarct growth in human acute ischemic stroke based on image analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence from multiple previous studies indicate that ADC maps are likely to reveal brain regions belonging to the ischemic penumbra, that is, areas that may be at risk of infarction in the few hours following stroke onset.
Materials and Methods. In a context where "time is brain," and contrarily to the altemative-and still-debated-perfusion-diffusion weighted image (PWIDWI) mismatch approach, the DWI magnetic resonance sequences are standardized, fast to acquire, and do not necessitate injection of a contrast agent. The image analysis approach presented here consists of the segmentation of the ischemic penumbra using a fast three-dimensional region-growing technique that mimics the growth of the infarct lesion during acute stroke.; Results. The method was evaluated with both numerical simulations and on two groups of 20 ischemic stroke patients (40 patients total). The first group of patient data was used to adjust the parameters of the model ruling the region-growing procedure. The second group of patient data was dedicated to evaluation purposes only, with no subsequent adjustment of the free parameters of the image-analysis procedure. Results indicate that the predicted final infarct volumes are significantly correlated with the true final lesion volumes as revealed by follow-up measurements from DWI sequences.; Conclusion. The DWI-ADC mismatch method is an encouraging fast alternative to the PWI-DWI mismatch approach to evaluate the likeliness of infarct growth during the acute stage of ischemic stroke.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The theoretical advantages of augmented reality (AR) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based high-definition fiber tractography (HDFT) and sodium fluorescein (F) in high-grade glioma (HGG) surgery have not been investigated in detail. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy profiles of HDFT-F microscope-based AR cytoreductive surgery for newly diagnosed supratentorial HGGs.
METHODS Data of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial HGGs who underwent surgery using the AR HDFT-F technique were reviewed and compared with those of a cohort of patients who underwent conventional white-light surgery assisted by infrared neuronavigation. The safety and efficacy of the techniques were reported based on the postoperative Neurological Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scores, extent of resection (EOR), and Kaplan-Meier curves, respectively. The chi-square test was conducted for categorical variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.; RESULTS A total of 54 patients underwent surgery using the AR HDFT-F technique, and 63 underwent conventional white-light surgery assisted by infrared neuronavigation. The mean postoperative NANO scores were 3.8 +- 2 and 5.2 +- 4 in the AR HDFT-F group and control group, respectively (p < 0.05). The EOR was higher in the AR HDFT-F group (p < 0.05) than in the control group. With a mean follow-up of 12.2 months, the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in the study group (log-rank test, p = 0.006) than in the control group. Moreover, the complication rates were 9.2% and 9.5% in the study and control groups, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS Overall, AR HDFT-F-assisted surgery is safe and effective in maximizing the EOR and PFS rate for patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial HGGs, and in optimizing patient functional outcomes.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Perioperative cerebral infarction is a potential complication of glioma resection, of which insular tumors are at higher risk because of the proximity of middle cerebral artery branches, including the lateral lenticulostriates and long insular arteries. In this study, 3 patients received three-dimensional rotational angiography, which was fused with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for frameless stereotactic navigation during dominant-hemisphere insular glioma resection.
METHODS: All patients obtained a preoperative catheter angiogram with a three-dimensional rotational acquisition of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. The pixel-based axial three-dimensional angiography data, thin-cut structural MRI, tractography from diffusion tensor imaging, and expressive language activation from functional MRI were uploaded into the iPlan software (Brainlab, Heimstetten, Germany) and fused. The target tumor, regional blood vessels, adjacent functional areas, and their associated fiber tracts were segmented and overlaid on the appropriate MRI sequence. This image fusion was used preoperatively to visualize the relationship of the mass with the adjacent vasculature and intraoperatively for frameless stereotactic navigation to optimize preservation of arterial structures.; RESULTS: Three patients aged 27-60 years with excellent baseline functional status presented with seizures and were found to have a large dominant-hemisphere T2 hyperintense nonenhancing insular mass. Surgical resection was performed using multimodality neuronavigation. None sustained a postoperative arterial infarction or a perioperative neurologic deficit.; CONCLUSIONS: Neuronavigation using a fusion of three-dimensional rotational angiography with MRI is a technique that can be used for preoperative planning and during resection of insular gliomas to optimize preservation of adjacent arteries.

N2  -  Background: Involvement of central nervous system is very common in Behcet disease, known as neuro-Behcet disease (NBD). However, there have been few reports which evaluated stroke-like cerebral small-vessel disease associated with Behcet disease. Objective: We evaluated cerebral small-vessel lesions by using magnetic resonance imaging in 2 patients with NBD. Clinical Cases: In a 41-year-old woman case, who developed dysarthria and left hemiparesis, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed small high-intensity areas in the bilateral internal capsule. The right lesion had a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, whereas the left one had a high value. In a 59-year-old woman case, who developed dysarthria and left hemi-hypesthesia, DWI showed high-intensity areas in the right side of the pons and in the right peduncle of the midbrain. The lesion in the pons had a low ADC value, whereas the lesion in the midbrain had a high value. ADC map may be useful to identify symptomatic lesions in the brain, because only the lesions with low ADC values were symptomatic. Conclusions: NBD should be considered in those who had not had any risk factors for ischemic stroke but experienced cerebral small-vessel disease. (C) 2015 by National Stroke Association

N2  -  Adopting a network perspective, the structural connectome reveals the large-scale white matter connectivity of the human brain, yielding insights into cerebral organization otherwise inaccessible to researchers and clinicians. Connectomics has great potential for elucidating abnormal connectivity in congenital brain malformations, especially axonal pathfinding disorders. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is one of the most common brain malformations and can also be considered a prototypical genetic disorder of axonal guidance in humans. In this exploratory study, the structural connectome of AgCC is mapped and compared to that of the normal human brain. Multiple levels of granularity of the AgCC connectome are investigated, including summary network metrics, modularity analysis, and network consistency measures, with comparison to the normal structural connectome after simulated removal of all callosal connections ("virtual callostomy"). These investigations reveal four major findings. First, global connectivity is abnormally reduced in AgCC, but local connectivity is increased. Second, the network topology of AgCC is more variable than that of the normal human connectome, contradicting the predictions of the virtual callostomy model. Third, modularity analysis reveals that many of the tracts that comprise the structural core of the cerebral cortex have relatively weak connectivity in AgCC, especially the cingulate bundles bilaterally. Finally, virtual lesions of the Probst bundles in the AgCC connectome demonstrate that there is consistency across subjects in many of the connections generated by these ectopic white matter tracts, and that they are a mixture of cortical and subcortical fibers. These results go beyond prior diffusion tractography studies to provide a systems-level perspective on anomalous connectivity in AgCC. Furthermore, this work offers a proof of principle for the utility of the connectome framework in neurodevelopmental disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Traumatic spinal cord injury occurs when an external physical impact damages the spinal cord and leads to permanent neurological dysfunction and disability, and it is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. Conventional MRI plays a crucial role in the diagnostic workup as it reveals extrinsic compression of the spinal cord and disruption of the discoligamentous complex. Additionally, it can reveal macrostructural evidence of primary intramedullary damage such as haemorrhage, oedema, post-traumatic cystic cavities, and tissue bridges. Quantitative MRI, such as magnetisation transfer, magnetic resonance relaxation mapping, and diffusion imaging, enables the tracking of secondary changes across the neuraxis at the microstructural level. Both conventional MRI and quantitative MRI metrics, obtained early after spinal cord injury, are predictive of clinical outcome. Thus, neuroimaging biomarkers could serve as surrogate endpoints for more efficient future trials targeting acute and chronic spinal cord injury. The adoption of neuroimaging biomarkers in centres for spinal cord injury might lead to personalised patient care.

N2  -  BackgroundAxons and myelin sheaths are the physical foundation for white matter (WM) to perform normal functions. Our previous study found the metabolite abnormalities in frontal, parietal, and occipital normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients by applying a 2D H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method. Since the metabolite changes may associate with the microstructure changes, we used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method to assess the integrity of NAWM in this study. MethodDiffusion tensor imaging scan was performed on 17 clinically definite RRMS patients and 21 age-matched healthy controls on a 3.0-T scanner. DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were extracted from 19 predefined regions of interest (ROIs), which were generated by removing a mask of manually drawn probabilistic lesion map from the Johns Hopkins University white-matter atlas. The mean values of FA, MD, AD, and RD were compared between different groups in the same ROIs. ResultsA probabilistic lesion map was successfully generated, and the lesion regions were eliminated from the WM atlas. We found that the RRMS patients had significantly lower FA in the entire corpus callosum (CC), bilateral of anterior corona radiata, and right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR). At the same time, RRMS patients showed significantly higher MD in the bilateral anterior corona radiata and superior corona radiata. Moreover, all AD values increased, and the bilateral external capsule, PTR, and left tapetum NAWM show statistical significance. What is more, all NAWM tracts showed increasing RD values in RRMS patients, and the bilateral superior corona radiata, the anterior corona radiata, right PTR, and the genu CC reach statistical significance. ConclusionOur study revealed widespread microstructure changes in NAWM in RRMS patients through a ready-made WM atlas and probabilistic lesion map. These findings support the hypothesis of demyelination, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and axonal injury in NAWM for RRMS. The DTI-based metrics could be considered as potential non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To evaluate whether apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) calculated from diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR) images can be used to characterize head and neck lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging was performed with a 1.5-T MR unit in 97 head and neck lesions in 97 patients. Images were obtained with a diffusion-weighted factor, factor b, of 0, 500, and 1,000 secmm(2) and an ADC map was constructed. The ADCs of lesions, cerebrospinal fluid, and spinal cord were calculated.; RESULTS: Acceptable images for ADC measurement were obtained in 81 (84%) patients. The mean ADC of malignant lymphomas, (0.66 +- 0.17SD) X 10(-3) mm(2)sec (n = 13), was significantly smaller (P < .001) than that of carcinomas. The mean ADC of carcinomas, (1.13 +- 0.43) X 10(-3) mm(2)sec (n = 36), was significantly smaller (P = .002) than that of benign solid tumors. The mean ADC of benign solid tumors, (1.56 +- 0.51) X 10(-3) mm(2)sec (n = 22), was significantly smaller (P = .035) than that of benign cystic lesions, (2.05 +- 0.62) X 10(-3) mm(2)sec (n = 10). No significant differences were seen in the mean ADC of cerebrospinal fluid and of spinal cord among four groups of lesions. When an ADC smaller than 1.22 X 10(-3) mm(2)sec was used for predicting malignancy, the highest accuracy of 86%, with 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity, was obtained.; CONCLUSION: Measurement of ADCs may be used to characterize head and neck lesions.

N2  -  Despite the many studies of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, efficient therapy for stroke is still lacking, emphasizing the need for further development and characterization of experimental stroke models. In the present study, the rather unexplored multifocal microsphere-induced stroke model in rats was characterized by multiparametric MRI. We induced microembolic infarction in a group of Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting a dose of about 1000 50-mum polyethylene microspheres intracranially from the external carotid artery. Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T-2-weighted MRI were used to evaluate the infarct development during and following the first 3 hr after microsphere injection (N = 20). The animals were also imaged at 12-hr (N = 8), 24-hr (N = 17), and 48-hr (N = 5) time points. After the final imaging time point, the brains were removed and sectioned into 2-mm-thick slices, and infarct volumes were measured by 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. From calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, a volume of reduced ADC appeared 0.5-1.0 hr postinjection, and by the 3-hr time point the volume of ADC reduction had increased to a size of 5% +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM) of the brain hemisphere. The lesion volume increased significantly (P < 0.01) to 16% +/- 2% of the hemisphere volume at the 12-hr time point, while at 24 hr the lesion (15% +/- 2% of the hemisphere) was also significantly larger (P < 0.001) than at 3 hr. The perfusion deficit resulting from the microsphere injection was immediate, going from a cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) of 74% +/- 3% at the time of microsphere injection to 68% +/- 2% of the contralateral mean at 3 hr (P < 0.05), to 55% +/- 4% of the contralateral values at 12 hr (P < 0.05), and to 57% +/- 2% of the contralateral mean at 24 hr (P < 0.001). The lesion development in the microsphere-induced stroke model was found to be slower than in the MCAO model, and continued up to the 24-48-hr time point. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T2  -  FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE

N2  -  Recent studies have suggested a tightly connected perisylvian neural network associated with spatial neglect. Here we investigated whether structural damage in one part of the network typically is accompanied with functional damage in other, structurally intact areas of this network. By combining normalized fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery ( FLAIR) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) we asked whether or not lesions centering on fronto-temporal regions co-occur with abnormal perfusion in structurally intact parietal cortex. With thresholds applied to delineate behaviourally relevant malperfusion of brain tissue, the analysis of normalized time-to-peak (TTP) and maximal signal reduction (MSR) perfusion maps did not reveal significant changes outside the area of structural damage. In particular, we found no abnormal perfusion in the structurally intact inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and/or the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). The present results obtained in three consecutively admitted neglect patients with fronto-temporal lesions indicate that structural damage in one part of the right perisylvian network associated with spatial neglect does not necessarily require dysfunction by malperfusion in other, structurally intact parts of the network to provoke spatial neglect. The neural tissue in the fronto-temporal cortex appears to have an original role in processes of spatial orienting and exploration.

N2  -  Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging has been in clinical use for various indications, including characterization and grading of intracranial neoplasms. However, several technical factors can lead to pitfalls in image interpretation. This review discusses the extraction of T1 and T2* information from mean curve analysis of DSC perfusion imaging of various brain tumors, which provides further insights into tumor biology and, thus, may be useful in the differential diagnosis of such tumors. Indeed, by looking at the mean time signal intensity curve from the tumor bed in addition to the rCBV maps, it is possible to obtain further inferences of capillary density and lesion leakiness. When dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) T1 perfusion is not available, DSC perfusion with mean curve analysis appears to be a valid alternative for characterizing various brain neoplasms in a routine clinical setting.

N2  -  We aimed to compare the ability of diffusion tensor imaging and multi-compartment spherical mean technique to detect focal tissue damage and in distinguishing between different connectivity patterns associated with varying clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Seventy-six people diagnosed with MS were scanned using a SIEMENS Prisma Fit 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), employing both conventional (T1w and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) and advanced diffusion MRI sequences from which fractional anisotropy (FA) and microscopic FA (mu FA) maps were generated. Using automated fiber quantification (AFQ), we assessed diffusion profiles across multiple white matter (WM) pathways to measure the sensitivity of anisotropy diffusion metrics in detecting localized tissue damage. In parallel, we analyzed structural brain connectivity in a specific patient cohort to fully grasp its relationships with cognitive and physical clinical outcomes. This evaluation comprehensively considered different patient categories, including cognitively preserved (CP), mild cognitive deficits (MCD), and cognitively impaired (CI) for cognitive assessment, as well as groups distinguished by physical impact: those with mild disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] <=3) and those with moderate-severe disability (EDSS >3). In our initial objective, we employed Ridge regression to forecast the presence of focal MS lesions, comparing the performance of mu FA and FA. mu FA exhibited a stronger association with tissue damage and a higher predictive precision for focal MS lesions across the tracts, achieving an R-squared value of .57, significantly outperforming the R-squared value of .24 for FA (p-value <.001). In structural connectivity, mu FA exhibited more pronounced differences than FA in response to alteration in both cognitive and physical clinical scores in terms of effect size and number of connections. Regarding cognitive groups, FA differences between CP and MCD groups were limited to 0.5% of connections, mainly around the thalamus, while mu FA revealed changes in 2.5% of connections. In the CP and CI group comparison, which have noticeable cognitive differences, the disparity was 5.6% for FA values and 32.5% for mu FA. Similarly, mu FA outperformed FA in detecting WM changes between the MCD and CI groups, with 5% versus 0.3% of connections, respectively. When analyzing structural connectivity between physical disability groups, mu FA still demonstrated superior performance over FA, disclosing a 2.1% difference in connectivity between regions closely associated with physical disability in MS. In contrast, FA spotted a few regions, comprising only 0.6% of total connections. In summary, mu FA emerged as a more effective tool than FA in predicting MS lesions and identifying structural changes across patients with different degrees of cognitive and global disability, offering deeper insights into the complexities of MS-related impairments.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The traditional neurosurgical approach to cerebral lesions is based on the classic view of a rigid brain organization in fixed "eloquent" areas. However, this method is brought into discussion by the conceptual and methodological advances in neurosciences that provide a more dynamic representation of the anatomo-functional distribution of the human central nervous system (CNS).
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We review the relevant literature concerning the main features of the modern CNS representation and their implications in neurosurgical practice.; RESULTS: The CNS is an integrated, wide, plastic network made up of cortical functional epicenters, "topic organization," connected by both short-local and large-scale white matter fibers, ie, "hodological organization." According to this model, called hodotopic, brain function results from parallel streams of information dynamically modulated within an interactive, multimodal, and widely distributed circuit. The application of this framework, which can be studied by combining preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative mapping techniques, enables the neurosurgeon exploration of the individual anatomo-functional architecture, including neurocognitive and emotional aspects. Thus, it is possible to adapt the surgical approach specifically to each patient and to each lesion according to the individual organization. Several experiences demonstrate the possibility of removing regions traditionally considered inoperable without inducing permanent deficits and the potential use of these areas as a safe passage to deeper territories.; CONCLUSION: We advocate the more systematic integration of a hodotopical view of the CNS to improve the surgical indications and planning for brain lesions, with the goal of optimizing both the extent of resection and functional outcome.

N2  -  We suggest using the wide-field imaging Mueller polarimetry to contrast optically anisotropic fiber tracts of healthy brain white matter for the detection of brain tumor borders during neurosurgery. Our prior studies demonstrate that this polarimetric imaging modality detects correctly the in-plane orientation of brain white matter fiber tracts of a flat formalin-fixed thick brain specimen in reflection geometry [IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 39, 4376 (2020)]. Here we present the results of ex vivo polarimetric studies of large cross-sections of fresh calf brain in reflection geometry with a special focus on the impact of the adverse measurement conditions (e.g. complex surface topography, presence of blood, etc.) on the quality of polarimetric images and the detection performance of white matter fiber tracts and their in-plane orientation.

T2  -  BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION

N2  -  Commonly, in lesion-behaviour studies structural changes in brain matter are depicted and analysed. However, in addition to these structural changes, brain areas might be structurally intact but non-functional due to malperfusion. These changes may be detected using perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI). Perfusion parameters most commonly used [e.g. time-to-peak (TTP)] are semi-quantitative and perfusion is evaluated in relation to a non-affected reference area. Traditionally, the mean of a larger region in the non-affected hemisphere or the cerebellum has been used ["mean contra-region of interest (ROI) comparison"]. Our results suggest that this method is prone to biases (in particular in periventricular regions) because perfusion differs between different parts of the brain, for example, between grey and white matter. We reduced such potential biases with voxelwise inter-hemispheric comparisons. Each voxel is compared with its homologous voxel and thus white matter with white matter and grey matter with grey matter. This automated method seems to correspond with results deriving from manual delineation of perfusion deficits. The TTP delay maps with a threshold of 3 s seem to be best comparable to manual delineation. Our method avoids the observer-dependent choice of a reference region and involves the spatial normalisation of perfusion maps. It is well suited for whole-brain analysis of abnormal perfusion in neuroscience studies as well as in clinical contexts.

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis (MS) damages central white matter pathways which has considerable impact on disease-related disability. To identify disease-related alterations in anatomical connectivity, 34 patients (19 with relapsing remitting MS (RR-MS), 15 with secondary progressive MS (SP-MS) and 20 healthy subjects underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain. Based on the dMRI, anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM) yielded a voxel-based metric reflecting the connectivity shared between each individual voxel and all other brain voxels. To avoid biases caused by inter-individual brain-shape differences, they were estimated in a spatially normalized space. Voxel-based statistical analyses using ACM were compared with analyses based on the localized microstructural indices of fractional anisotropy (FA). In both RR-MS and SP-MS patients, considerable portions of the motor-related white matter revealed decreases in ACM and FA when compared with healthy subjects. Patients with SP-MS exhibited reduced ACM values relative to RR-MS in the motor-related tracts, whereas there were no consistent decreases in FA between SP-MS and RR-MS patients. Regional ACM statistics exhibited moderate correlation with clinical disability as reflected by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). The correlation between these statistics and EDSS was either similar to or stronger than the correlation between FA statistics and the EDSS. Together, the results reveal an improved relationship between ACM, the clinical phenotype, and impairment. This highlights the potential of the ACM connectivity indices to be used as a marker which can identify disease related-alterations due to MS which may not be seen using localized microstructural indices.

N2  -  Objectives The accuracy of 'no evidence of disease activity' (NEDA) in predicting long-term clinical outcome in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is unproven, and there is growing evidence that NEDA does not rule out disease worsening. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate whether ongoing brain microstructural injury occurs in patients with RRMS meeting NEDA criteria.
Methods We performed a retrospective study to identify patients with RRMS visiting our centre over a 3-month period who had undergone prior longitudinal DTI evaluation at our facility spanning >= 2 years. Patients meeting NEDA criteria throughout the evaluation period were included in the NEDA group, and those not meeting NEDA criteria were included in an 'evidence of disease activity' (EDA) group. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were created, and annual rates of change were calculated.; Results We enrolled 85 patients, 39 meeting NEDA criteria. Both NEDA and EDA groups showed longitudinal DTI worsening. Yearly FA decrease was lower in the NEDA group (0.5%, p<0.0001) than in the EDA group (1.2%, p=0.003), while yearly MD increase was similar in both groups (0.8% for NEDA and EDA, both p<0.01). There was no statistical difference in deterioration within and outside of T2 lesions. DTI parameters correlated with disability scores and fatigue complaints.; Conclusions White matter microstructural deterioration occurs in patients with RRMS over short-term follow-up in patients with NEDA, providing further evidence of the limitations of conventional measures and arguing for DTI in monitoring of the disease process.

N2  -  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography is currently the only imaging technique that allows for non-invasive delineation and visualisation of white matter (WM) tracts in vivo, prompting rapid advances in related fields of brain MRI research in recent years. One of its major clinical applications is for pre-surgical planning and intraoperative image guidance in neurosurgery, where knowledge about the location of WM tracts nearby the surgical target can be helpful to guide surgical resection and optimise post-surgical outcomes. Surgical injuries to these WM tracts can lead to permanent neurological and functional deficits, making the accuracy of tractography reconstructions paramount. The quality of dMRI tractography is influenced by many modifiable factors, ranging from MRI data acquisition through to the post-processing of tractography output, with the potential of error propagation based on decisions made at each and subsequent processing steps. Research over the last 25 years has significantly improved the anatomical accuracy of tractography. An updated review about tractography methodology in the context of neurosurgery is now timely given the thriving research activities in dMRI, to ensure more appropriate applications in the clinical neurosurgical realm. This article aims to review the dMRI physics, and tractography methodologies, highlighting recent advances to provide the key concepts of tractography-informed neurosurgery, with a focus on the general considerations, the current state of practice, technical challenges, potential advances, and future demands to this field.

N2  -  Background: The relationship between walking disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their macro and microstructural MRI-derived measures still remains unclear. Objective: To assess the correlations between walking disability and MRI-derived lesion, atrophy, and micro-structural/axonal integrity outcomes.
Methods: Seventy-one (71) MS patients were clinically examined, the expanded timed get-up and go (ETGUG), and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) tests were assessed. Additionally, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) was obtained. Normalized brain (NBV), gray matter (GMV), white matter (WMV), cortex (CV), and deep GM (DGM) volumes, as well as lesion volumes (LV) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scalar maps of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were calculated. Spearman correlation, partial correlation and stepwise regression analyses were performed.; Results: T25FW and ETGUG were associated with T2-LV (p < .001), global (NBV, p < .001), tissue-specific (GMV and CV, p < .001) and regional (DGM p <.001; and thalamus p < .001) volumes. The ETGUG remained correlated with Tl-LV, GMV, CV and total DGM volume (all p < .001) after age, sex, and disease duration adjustment. The WMV was not associated with walking disability. Similarly, DTI measures did not show significant association with the walking tests. The regression analysis outlined DMG volume as best predictor of T25FW (Adj R-2 = 0.231, standardized 13 = 0.435, and p = .001), and CV for ETGUG (Adj R-2 = 0.176, standardized beta = -0.417, and p = .004). SDMT was associated with both T25FW (p = .004) and ETGUG (p = .013).; Conclusion: Despite the low disability levels, walking as measured by T25FW and ETGUG, is largely explained by the loss of cortical and nuclei specific GM volumes.

N2  -  The inter-arterial watershed zone in neonates is a geographic area without discernible anatomic boundaries and difficult to demarcate and usually not featured in atlases. Schematics currently used to depict the areas are not based on any prior anatomic mapping, compared to adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of neonates in the acute to subacute phase with suspected hypoxic-ischaemic injury (HII) can demonstrate signal abnormality and restricted diffusion in the cortical and subcortical parenchyma of the watershed regions. In the chronic stage of partial-prolonged hypoxic-ischaemic injury, atrophy and ulegyria can make the watershed zone more conspicuous as a region. Our aim is to use images extracted from a sizable medicolegal database (approximately 2000 cases), of delayed MRI scans in children with cerebral palsy, to demonstrate the watershed region. To achieve this, we have selected cases diagnosed on imaging as having sustained a term pattern of partial-prolonged HII affecting the hemispheric cortex, based on the presence of bilateral, symmetric atrophy with ulegyria. From these, we have identified those patients demonstrating injury along the whole watershed continuum as well as those demonstrating selective anterior or posterior watershed predominant injury for demonstration. Recognition of this zone is essential for diagnosing partial-prolonged hypoxic-ischaemic injury sustained in term neonates. The images presented in this pictorial review provide a template for identifying the cortical watershed distribution when there is milder regional (anterior, parasagittal, peri-Sylvian and posterior) watershed injury and for more severe injury where multiple regions are injured in combination or as a continuum.

N2  -  Purpose: Brain metastases are almost universally lethal with short median survival times. Despite this, they are often potentially curable, with therapy failing only because of local relapse. One key reason relapse occurs is because treatment planning did not delineate metastasis margins sufficiently or accurately, allowing residual tumor to regrow. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with a simple and automated analysis pipeline, could improve upon current clinical practice of single-modality, independent-observer tumor delineation.
Methods and Materials: We used a single rat model of brain metastasis (ENU1564 breast carcinoma cells in BD-IX rats), with and without radiation therapy. Multimodal MRI data were acquired using sequences either in current clinical use or in clinical trial and included postgadolinium T-1-weighted images and maps of blood flow, blood volume, T-1 and T-2 relaxation times, and apparent diffusion coefficient.; Results: In all cases, independent observers underestimated the true size of metastases from single-modality gadolinium-enhanced MRI (85 +- 36 mu L vs 131 +- 40 mu L histologic measurement), although multimodal MRI more accurately delineated tumor volume (132 +- 41 mu L). Multimodal MRI offered increased sensitivity compared with independent observer for detecting metastasis (0.82 vs 0.61, respectively), with only a slight decrease in specificity (0.86 vs 0.98). Blood flow maps conferred the greatest improvements in margin detection for late-stage metastases after radiation therapy. Gadolinium-enhanced T-1-weighted images conferred the greatest increase in accuracy of detection for smaller metastases.; Conclusions: These findings suggest that multimodal MRI of brain metastases could significantly improve the visualization of brain metastasis margins, beyond current clinical practice, with the potential to decrease relapse rates and increase patient survival. This finding now needs validation in additional tumor models or clinical cohorts. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions are known to evolve over time, but the duration and consequences of cerebral remodelling are unclear. Degenerative mechanisms occurring in the chronic phase after TBI could constitute "tertiary" lesions related to the neurological outcome. Objective: The objective of this prospective study of severe TBI was to longitudinally evaluate the volume of white and grey matter structures and white matter integrity with 2 time-point multimodal MRI.
Methods: Longitudinal MRI follow-up was obtained for 11 healthy controls (HCs) and 22 individuals with TBI (mean SD 60 15 months after injury) along with neuropsychological assessments. TBI individuals were classified in the "favourable" recovery group (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended GOSE 6-8) and "unfavourable" recovery group (GOSE 3-5) at 5 years. Variation in brain volumes (3D T1-weighted image) and white matter integrity (diffusion tensor imaging DTI) were quantitatively assessed over time and used to predict neurological outcome.; Results: TBI individuals showed a marked decrease in volumes of whole white matter (median -11.4% interquartile range -5.8; -14.6; p < 0.001) and deep grey nuclear structures (-17.1% -10.6; -20.5; p < 0.001). HCs did not show any significant change over the same time period. Median volumetric loss in several brain regions was higher with GOSE 3-5 than 6-8. These lesions were associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity at baseline. Volumetric variations were positively correlated with normalized fractional anisotropy and negatively with normalized mean diffusivity at baseline and follow-up. A computed predictive model with baseline DTI showed good accuracy to predict neurological outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.82 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.83); Conclusions: We characterised the striking atrophy of deep brain structures after severe TBI. DTI imaging in the subacute phase can predict the occurrence and localization of these tertiary lesions as well as long-term neurological outcome. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00577954.

N2  -  ObjectivePrimary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNS) are relatively rare tumors, accounting for about 4% of all brain tumors. On neuroimaging, they are characterized by a low MR signal in T1, isointense in T2, bright uniform contrast enhancement, and diffusion restriction. The aim of this study is to note the lack of effectiveness of the MR/CT perfusion technique in complex multiparametric imaging in the differential diagnosis of primary lymphomas of the central nervous system in comparison with highly malignant gliomas and brain metastases. Materials and MethodsThis prospective study included 80 patients with CNS tumors examined/operated at the Federal Center for Neurosurgery (Tyumen, Russia) from 2018 to 2021. The patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 consisted of 33 cases with primary CNS lymphomas (10 cases with atypical manifestations according to perfusion parameters and 23 cases of classic CNS lymphomas), group 2 with anaplastic astrocytomas-14 cases, group 3-23 cases with glioblastomas and group 4-10 cases with solitary metastatic lesions. The study was carried out on a General Electric Discovery W750 3T magnetic resonance tomograph, a Canon Aquilion One multispiral X-ray computed tomograph (Gadovist 7.5 ml, Yomeron 400 mg-50 ml). Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis was carried out with the following markers: CD3, CD20, CD34, Ki-67, VEGF. ResultsIt has been established that MR/CT perfusion is not a highly sensitive method for visualizing primary CNS lymphomas, as previously thought, but at the same time, the method has a number of undeniable advantages that make it indispensable in the algorithm of a complex multiparametric diagnostic approach for this type of tumor. Nevertheless, PLCNS is characterized by an atypical manifestation, which is an exception to the rule. ConclusionsThe possibilities of neuroimaging of primary lymphomas, even with the use of improved techniques for collecting MR/CT data, are limited and do not always allow reliable differentiation from other neoplasms.

N2  -  Purpose. This study was conducted to assess the possibility of identifying precise white matter tracts situated in proximity to intracranial tumours, to define the anatomical and topographical relations between the same white matter tracts and the tumour, to verify the possibility of integrating tractographic images in the context of a package of three-dimensional anatomical images to send to the neuronavigation system, to assess the impact of this information on surgical planning, and to analyse, both pre- and postoperatively, the patient's clinical conditions as an index of the functional integrity of the fibres themselves.
Materials and methods. Twenty-five patients underwent diffusion tensor study prior to neurosurgery. With the use of dedicated software, relative colour maps were obtained and the trajectories of the white matter tracts adjacent to the tumour were reconstructed in three dimensions. These were then processed for preoperative planning. Planning, which was performed with the neuronavigator, was based on analysis of the location of the course of the main white matter tracts adjacent to the lesion (pyramidal tract, optic radiation and arcuate fasciculus). Two neurosurgeons were asked whether the tractography images had modified the access andor intraoperative approach to the tumour. All patients were clinically assessed both pre- and postoperatively I month after the procedure to define the presence of symptoms related to the involvement of the white matter tracts studied and therefore to assess the integrity of the fibres after the operation.; Results. In one patient, the tumour was situated away from all the tracts studied and did not compress them in any way. Overall, 4075 tracts studied had no anatomical relation with the tumour, were not displaced by the turnout or could not be visualised in their entire course. Analysis of the remaining 35 white matter tracts led to an a priori change in the surgical approach for corticotomy in four patients (16%), with no disagreement between the two neurosurgeons and an impact on the extent of resection during surgery in 17 (68%), thus an overall impact on the surgical procedure in 80% of cases. Eight patients showed no symptoms related to the involvement of the white matter tracts studied. In the remaining 17 patients, the symptoms were related to involvement of the pyramidal tract, arcuate fasciculus or optic radiation. At 1-month follow-up, one previously asymptomatic patient reported a speech disorder (transcortical sensory dysphasia); in the remaining 24, symptoms remained unchanged, with a tendency to improvement in 1417 with symptoms related to involvement of white matter tracts studied.; Conclusions. Magnetic resonance (MR) tractography offers the neurosurgeon an anatomical panoramic view that can improve surgical planning for the resection of intracranial tumours. Despite the high incidence of cases in which the lesion is responsible for changes that hinder the reconstruction of white matter tracts, the technique can change the surgical approach for corticotomy, defines the extent of resection and leads to some change in the procedure in 80% of cases. The improvement of pre-existing symptoms and the absence of new symptoms in the postoperative phase, in our opinion, confirms the value of the technique.

N2  -  Spontaneous episodes of transient cell membrane depolarization (spreading depression [SD]) occur in the surroundings of experimental stroke lesions and are believed to contribute to infarct growth. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is capable of detecting the water shifts from extracellular to intracellular space associated with SD waves and ischemia, and can make in vivo measurements of these two features on a pixel-by-pixel basis with good temporal resolution. Using continuous high speed DWI with a temporal resolution of 12 seconds over a period of 3 hours, the in vivo contribution of spontaneous SDs to the development of ischemic tissue injury was examined in 8 rats using a thromboembolic stroke model. During the observation period, the initial lesion volume increased in 4 animals, remained unchanged in 1 animal, and decreased in 3 animals (most likely because of spontaneous clot lysis). Irrespective of the lesion evolution patterns, animals demonstrated 6.5 +/- 2.1 spontaneous SDs outside of the ischemic core. A time-to-peak analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes for each SD wave demonstrated multi-directional propagation patterns from variable initiation sites. Maps of the time constants of ADC recovery, reflecting the local energy supply and cerebral blood flow, revealed prolonged recovery times in areas close to the ischemic core. However, repetitive SD episodes in the periinfarct tissue did not eventually lead to permanent ADC reductions. These results suggest that spontaneous SD waves do not necessarily contribute to the expansion of the ischemic lesion volume in this model.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate normal-appearing white (NAWM) and cortical gray (NAGM) matter separately in multiple sclerosis (MS) in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Materials and Methods: In 64 MS patients (12 primary progressive PP, 38 relapsing remitting RR, 14 secondary progressive SP) and 20 healthy controls, whole-brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were acquired. A stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) DTI sequence was used with minimal geometrical distortion in comparison to echo-planar imaging (EPI). NAWM and NAGM were identified using conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images, allowing a cautious assessment of FA in cortex.; Results: Histogram analyses showed significant global FA decreases and ADC increases in MS NAWM compared to control WM. MS cortical NAGM had no significant global ADC increase, but FA was decreased significantly. In regional analyses, nearly all NAWM regions-of-interest (ROIs) had significantly increased ADC compared to controls, but FA was not changed. In nearly all cortical NAGM ROIs, ADC was significantly increased and FA significantly reduced. In multiple linear regression analyses in RRSPMS patients. NAGM-ADC histogram peak height was associated more strongly With clinical disability than T-2 lesion load.; Conclusion: Tissue damage occurs in both NAWM and cortical NAGM. The cortical damage appears to have more clinical impact than T-2 lesions.

N2  -  Background The effectiveness of conventional MRI (cMRI)-based radiomics in differentiating glioblastoma (GBM) from solitary brain metastases (SBM) is not satisfactory enough. Therefore, we aimed to develop an integrated radiomics model to improve the performance of differentiating GBM from SBM.
Methods One hundred patients with solitary brain tumors (50 with GBM, 50 with SBM) were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training set (n = 80) or validation set (n = 20). A total of 4,424 radiomic features were obtained from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) with the contrast-enhancing and peri-enhancing edema region, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) images. The partial least squares (PLS) regression with fivefold cross-validation is used to analyze the correlation between different radiomic features and different modalities. The cross-validity analysis was performed to judge whether a new principal component or a new feature dimension can significantly improve the final prediction effect. The principal components with effective interpretation in all radiomic features were projected to a low-dimensional space (2D in this study). The effective features of the new projection mapping were then sent to the random forest classifier to predict the results. The performance of differentiating GBM from SBM was compared between the integrated radiomics model and other radiomics models or nonradiomics methods using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).; Results Through the cross-validity analysis of partial least squares, hundreds of radiomic features were projected into a new two-dimensional space to complete the construction of radiomics model. Compared with the combined radiomics model using DWI + F-18-FDG PET (AUC = 0.93, p = 0.014), cMRI + DWI (AUC = 0.89, p = 0.011), cMRI + F-8-FDG PET (AUC = 0.91, p = 0.015), and single radiomics model using cMRI (AUC = 0.85, p = 0.018), DWI (AUC = 0.84, p = 0.017), and F-18-FDG PET (AUC = 0.85, p = 0.421), the integrated radiomics model (AUC = 0.98) showed more efficient diagnostic performance. The integrated radiomics model (AUC = 0.98) also showed significantly better performance than any single ADC, SUV, or TBR parameter (AUC = 0.57-0.71, p < 0.05). The integrated radiomics model showed better performance in the training (AUC = 0.98) and validation (AUC = 0.93) sets than any other models and methods, demonstrating robustness.; Conclusions We developed an integrated radiomics model incorporating DWI and F-18-FDG PET, which improved the performance of differentiating GBM from SBM greatly.

N2  -  In the macaque brain, surface maps give a misleading picture of cortical areas since half the cortex is in the sulci. Maps are inadequate also for depicting exptl. lesions since medullary involvement or partial penetration are not represented. Section outlines showing positions of Marchi granules or cell alterations throw the burden of synthesis and visualization on the observer. Even the identification of convolutions is difficult in spaced sections of the macaque''s brain. For these reasons a series of standard slice reconstructions is adopted for the presentation of areal topography and results of exptl. lesions. All exptl. brains and the standard normal brain are placed in a slotted mould which conforms in its configuration to the outside of the brain, and divided into slices 4 mm. thick. The sections of standard brain are stained alternately for cells and fibers. The inner and outer boundaries of the cortex and the principal internal units were graphically reconstructed in 4 mm. slice units, and the gyri and sulci labelled. The orientation of the cortical cells and radial fibers at all points was worked out by observation and added to the reconstructions as columns, properly directed. The series of 18 reconstruction drawings is a guide to interpretation of sections in the exptl. brains, and furnishes a frame for displaying the findings in the Marchi series in a 3-dimensional manner.

N2  -  Objective: To describe the imaging features of unusual intracranial cystic meningiomas in infants and adults.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the magnetic resonance and computed tomography findings for 2 female patients and 3 male patients, ranging in age from 1 to 73 years (median 41 years), with histopathologically proven cystic meningioma.; Result: Although cystic meningiomas usually appear as solid and cystic masses, they may present as a mainly multicystic lesion. The wall of a cystic part of the meningioma may include both enhancing and unenhancing areas at imaging. The cystic portion of a meningioma is hypointense on diffusion-weighted images and markedly hyperintense on corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps.; Conclusion: Cystic meningiomas may vary in appearance at imaging. They can be very challenging when present in infants. Knowledge of imaging findings and awareness of variability in the differential diagnosis can help to avoid preoperative diagnostic pitfalls.

N2  -  Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses positive pressure to induce convective flow of molecules and maximize drug distribution. Concerns have been raised about the effect of cystic structures on uniform drug distribution with CED. The authors describe the case of a patient with a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with a large cyst and examine its effect on drug distribution after CED with a radiolabeled antibody. The patient was treated according to protocol with CED of (124)l-8H9 to the pons for nonprogressive DIPG after radiation therapy as part of a Phase I trial (clinical trial registration no. NCT01502917, clinicaltrials.gov). Care was taken to avoid the cystic cavity in the planned catheter track and target point. Co-infusion with Gd-DTPA was performed to assess drug distribution. Infusate distribution was examined by MRI immediately following infusion and analyzed using iPlan Flow software. Analysis of postinfusion MR images demonstrated convective distribution around the catheter tip and an elongated configuration of drug distribution, consistent with the superoinferior corticospinal fiber orientation in the brainstem. This indicates that the catheter was functioning and a pressure gradient was established. No infusate entry into the cystic region could be identified on T2-weighted FLAIR or T1-weighted images. The effects of ependymal and pial surfaces on drug delivery using CED in brainstem tumors remain controversial. Drug distribution is a critical component of effective application of CED to neurosurgical lesions. This case suggests that cyst cavities may not always behave as fluid "sinks" for drug distribution. The authors observed that infusate was not lost into the cyst cavity, suggesting that lesions with cystic components can be treated by CED without significant alterations to target and infusion planning.

N2  -  Background Despite being one of the direct causes of depression, whether stroke-induced neuroanatomical deterioration actually plays an important role in the onset of poststroke depression (PSD) is controversial. We assessed the structural basis of PSD, particularly with regard to white matter connectivity.
Methods We evaluated lesion index, fractional anisotropy (FA) reduction and brain structural networks and then analyzed whole brain voxel-based lesions and FA maps. To understand brain damage in the context of brain connectivity, we used a graph theoretical approach. We selected nodes whose degree correlated with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected), after controlling for age, sex, years of education, lesion size, Mini Mental State Examination score and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. We used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to assess the contribution of the identified network toward poststroke major depression.; Results We included 116 stroke patients in the study. Fourteen patients (12.1%) had diagnoses of major depression and 26 (22.4%) had mild depression. We found that lesions in the right insular cortex, left putamen and right superior longitudinal fasciculus as well as FA reductions in broader areas were all associated with major depression. Seventeen nodes were selected to build the depression-related subnetwork. Decreased local efficiency of the subnetwork was a significant risk factor for poststroke major depression (relative risk 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.72-0.98, p = 0.027).; Limitations The inability of DTI tractography to process fibre crossings may have resulted in inaccurate construction of white matter networks and affected statistical findings.; Conclusion The present study provides, to our knowledge, the first graph theoretical analysis of white matter networks linked to poststroke major depression. These findings provide new insights into the neuroanatomical substrates of depression that develops after stroke.

N2  -  This study investigates an imaging method for distinguishing different lesions in brain cancer patients using MRI scans. Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor, and it is crucial to differentiate between actual tumor recurrence, radiation-induced damage, and side effects from a common treatment called Bevacizumab. Traditional MRI techniques often struggle to make these distinctions, leading to challenges in treatment decisions. This study explores the use of a specific MRI measurement, called Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values, to improve diagnostic accuracy. By identifying unique patterns in ADC values, this method could help better determine the nature of brain lesions, ultimately leading to more precise and effective treatment plans for glioblastoma patients. Objectives: Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common primary invasive neoplasms of the brain. Distinguishing between lesion recurrence and different types of treatment related changes in patients with GBM remains challenging using conventional MRI imaging techniques. Therefore, accurate and precise differentiation between true progression or pseudoresponse is crucial in deciding on the appropriate course of treatment. This retrospective study investigated the potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map values derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a noninvasive method to increase diagnostic accuracy in treatment response. Methods: A cohort of 21 glioblastoma patients (mean age: 59.2 +/- 11.8, 12 Male, 9 Female) that underwent treatment with bevacizumab were selected. The ADC values were calculated from the DWI images obtained from a standardized brain protocol across 1.5-T and 3-T MRI scanners. Ratios were calculated for rADC values. Lesions were classified as bevacizumab-induced cytotoxicity based on characteristic imaging features (well-defined regions of restricted diffusion with persistent diffusion restriction over the course of weeks without tissue volume loss and absence of contrast enhancement). The rADC value was compared to these values in radiation necrosis and recurrent lesions, which were concluded in our prior study. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test with p < 0.05 was used for significance. Results: The mean +/- SD age of the selected patients was 59.2 +/- 11.8. ADC values and corresponding mean rADC values for bevacizumab-induced cytotoxicity were 248.1 +/- 67.2 and 0.39 +/- 0.10, respectively. These results were compared to the ADC values and corresponding mean rADC values of tumor progression and radiation necrosis. Significant differences between rADC values were observed in all three groups (p < 0.001). Bevacizumab-induced cytotoxicity had statistically significant lower ADC values compared to both tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of ADC values as noninvasive imaging biomarkers for differentiating recurrent glioblastoma from radiation necrosis and bevacizumab-induced cytotoxicity.

N2  -  MRI offers a tremendous armamentarium of different methods that can be employed in brain tumor characterization. MR diffusion imaging has become a widely accepted method to probe for the presence of fluid pools and molecular tissue water mobility. For most clinical applications of diffusion imaging, it is assumed that the diffusion signal vs diffusion weighting factor b decays monoexponentially. Within this framework, the measurement of a single diffusion coefficient in brain tumors permits an approximate categorization of tumor type and, for some tumors, definitive diagnosis. In most brain tumors, when compared with normal brain tissue, the diffusion coefficient is elevated. The presence of peritumoral edema, which also exhibits an elevated diffusion coefficient, often precludes the delineation of the tumor on the basis of diffusion information alone. Serially obtained diffusion data are useful to document and even predict the cellular response to drug or radiation therapy. Diffusion measurements in tissues over an extended range of b factors have clearly shown that the monoparametric description of the MR diffusion signal decay is incomplete. Very high diffusion weighting on clinical systems requires substantial compromise in spatial resolution. However, after suitable analysis, superior separation of malignant brain tumors, peritumoral edema and normal brain tissue can be achieved. These findings are also discussed in the light of tissue-specific differences in membrane structure and the restrictions exerted by membranes on diffusion. Finally, measurement of the directional dependence of diffusion permits the assessment of white matter integrity and dislocation. Such information, particularly in conjunction with advanced post-processing, is considered to be immensely useful for therapy planning. Diffusion imaging, which permits monoexponential analysis and provides directional diffusion information, is performed routinely in brain tumor patients. More advanced methods require improvement in acquisition speed and spatial resolution to gain clinical acceptance. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Greater extent of resection (EOR) of low-grade gliomas is associated with improved survival. Proximity to eloquent cortical regions often limits resectability and elevates the risk of surgery-related deficits. Therefore, functional localization of eloquent cortex or subcortical fiber tracts can enhance the EOR and functional outcome. Imaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking, and neurophysiological methods like navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetoencephalography, make it possible to identify eloquent areas prior to resective surgery and to tailor indication and surgical approach but also to assess the surgical risk. lntraoperative monitoring with direct cortical stimulation and subcortical stimulation enables surgeons to preserve essential functional tissue during surgery. Through tailored pre- and intraoperative mapping and monitoring the EOR can be maximized, with reduced rates of surgery-related deficits.

N2  -  We studied five patients with herpes simplex encephalitis type I with diffusion-weighted MR imaging, as this sequence provides information regarding tissue integrity. Diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained using the echo-planar sequence. True diffusion images (i.e. b = 1000 s/mm(2) images), and the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values were studied. In addition, diffusion imaging of 12 normal cases, 46 patients with acute ischemia (cytotoxic edema), and 12 patients with vasogenic edema were studied for comparison. La patients with herpes encephalitis, two distinct types of diffusion imaging findings (on b = 1000 s/mm(2) images, and ADC maps) were noted: lesions similar to cytotoxic edema, and lesions similar to vasogenic edema. The patients with the former type of lesions had fulminating disease, and were in severe clinical condition. Those with the latter represented early cases, and they were in fairly good clinical condition with a good outcome by prompt therapy. Diffusion imaging appears to be a promising sequence to monitor the changes in the brain tissue in herpes encephalitis, and in other infections as well with respect to restriction of movement (cytotoxic edema) or relatively high-motion (vasogenic edema) of water molecules, providing data on the severity of the disease.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor MRI provides unique directional diffusion information that can be used to estimate the patterns of white matter connectivity in the human brain. In this study, the behavior of an algorithm for white matter tractography is examined. The algorithm, called TEND, uses the entire diffusion tensor to deflect the estimated fiber trajectory. Simulations and imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the tractography algorithm. The simulation show that the deflection term is less sensitive than the major eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus, This approach is promising for mapping the organizational patterns of white matter in the human brain as well as mapping the relationship between major fiber trajectories and the location and extent of brain lesions.

N2  -  Vigabatrin, the gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T)-inhibiting anticonvulsant drug, was given orally at a dose of 275 mg/kg/day to rats (n = 6) in their feed for a period of 12 weeks, during which T-2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and diffusion-weighted MRIs (DWIs) were collected at weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Half the rats (n = 3; and half their age-matched littermate controls; n = 3) were then killed for histopathological confirmation of the observed VGB-induced cerebellar and cortical white-matter lesions. VGB was removed from the diet and additional MRIs of the remaining rats taken at weeks 14, 17, 20, and 24, at which time they (n 3), along with remaining controls (n = 3), were also killed for histopathology. The T-2-weighted MRIs acquired were used to compute T-2 relaxation time maps. Statistically significant VGB-induced T-2 increases were observed in the frontal and occipital cortices and in the cerebellar white matter (CWM). The cerebellar lesions were more clearly discerned by eye in the DWIs than by T-2-contrast alone. During the recovery period the VGB-treatment group CWM-T-2 and CWM-DWI hyperintensity greatly decreased as the reversible lesion disappeared. As expected, histological and immunocytochemical examinations demonstrated the presence of intra-myelinic edema, microvacuolation, and reactive astrocytosis in the CWM and cortex after 12 weeks VGB-treatment. In the remaining animals microvacuolation of the white matter had not completely resolved during the 12-week recovery phase. The data show that quantitative MRI T-2-relaxometry can be used to detect VGB-induced CNS pathology, and also suggest that DWI is particularly sensitive to the cerebellar lesion. The reversible neurotoxicity of global GABA-elevation in experimental animals is discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Synthetic MRI enables the generation of various contrast-weighted images and quantitative data in a reasonable scanning time. We aimed to use synthetic MRI to assess the detection and underlying tissue characteristics of focal areas of signal intensity and normal-appearing brain parenchyma and morphometric alterations in the brains of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional MR imaging and synthetic MRI were prospectively obtained from 19 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and 18 healthy controls. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated focal areas of signal intensity on both conventional MR imaging and synthetic MRI. Additionally, automatically segmented volume calculations of the brain in both groups and quantitative analysis of myelin, including the focal areas of signal intensity and normal-appearing brain parenchyma, of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 were performed using synthetic MRI. RESULTS: The comparison of conventional MR imaging and synthetic MRI showed good correlation in the supratentorial region of the brain (? = 0.82?1). Automatically segmented brain parenchymal volume, intracranial volume, and GM volumes were significantly increased in the patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (P < .05). The myelin-correlated compound, myelin fraction volume, WM fraction volume, transverse relaxation rate, and longitudinal relaxation rate values were significantly decreased in focal areas of signal intensity on myelin and WM maps (P < .001); however, GM, GM fraction volume, and proton density values were significantly increased on the GM map (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic MRI is a potential tool for the assessment of morphometric and tissue alterations as well as the detection of focal areas of signal intensity in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 in a reasonable scan time.

N2  -  Creativity is a vast construct, seemingly intractable to scientific inquiry-perhaps due to the vague concepts applied to the field of research. One attempt to limit the purview of creative cognition formulates the construct in terms of evolutionary constraints, namely that of blind variation and selective retention (BVSR). Behaviorally, one can limit the "blind variation" component to idea generation tests as manifested by measures of divergent thinking. The "selective retention" component can be represented by measures of convergent thinking, as represented by measures of remote associates. We summarize results from measures of creative cognition, correlated with structural neuroimaging measures including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We also review lesion studies, considered to be the "gold standard" of brain-behavioral studies. What emerges is a picture consistent with theories of disinhibitory brain features subserving creative cognition, as described previously (Martindale, 1981). We provide a perspective, involving aspects of the default mode network (DMN), which might provide a "first approximation" regarding how creative cognition might map on to the human brain.

N2  -  Purpose: The accuracy of target delineation in radiation treatment planning of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) is crucial to achieve high tumor control, while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the standard imaging modality for delineation of gliomas with inherent limitations in accurately determining the microscopic extent of tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess the survival impact of multi-observer delineation variability of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and [F-18]-FET PET/CT. Materials and Methods: Thirty prospectively included patients with histologically confirmed HGGs underwent a PET/CT and mpMRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI: b0, b1000, ADC), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1-Gado), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2Flair), and perfusion-weighted imaging with computation of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and K2 maps. Nine radiation oncologists delineated the PET/CT and MRI sequences. Spatial similarity (Dice similarity coefficient: DSC) was calculated between the readers for each sequence. Impact of the DSC on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Results: The highest DSC mean values were reached for morphological sequences, ranging from 0.71 +/- 0.18 to 0.84 +/- 0.09 for T2Flair and T1Gado, respectively, while metabolic volumes defined by PET/CT achieved a mean DSC of 0.75 +/- 0.11. rCBV variability (mean DSC0.32 +/- 0.20) significantly impacted PFS (p = 0.02) and OS (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Our data suggest that the T1-Gado and T2Flair sequences were the most reproducible sequences, followed by PET/CT. Reproducibility for functional sequences was low, but rCBV inter-reader similarity significantly impacted PFS and OS.

N2  -  MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-FLAIR mismatch is known as predictive of symptom onset within 4.5 h. This study assessed the breakdown of cytoskeletal protein and blood-brain barrier (BBB) in DWI-T2 mismatch. We employed occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in C57BL/6 mice. We serially measured MRI including DWI and T2WI. After MRI, we prepared brain sections or samples and examined microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) expression, alpha-fodrin degradation, extravasation of albumin and claudin-5 expression. In permanent or transient MCAO for 45 min, DWI hyperintensities was already found at 60 min without change of T2, showing DWI-T2 mismatch. In permanent MCAO, MAP2 expressions were preserved, and no extravasation of albumin was observed. In transient MCAO, MAP2 immunoreaction was already lost in the lateral part of the striatum. In both models, alpha-fodrin degradation was already detected. At 180 min, T2 hyperintensities appeared, where MAP2 signal was lost and albumin extravasation was found. At 24 h, hyperintensities of DWI and T2WI was found in the whole MCA territory, where MAP2 signal was completely lost with marked albumin extravasation and alpha-fodrin degradation. Immunoreaction for claudin-5 was preserved up to 180 min. DWI-T2 mismatch area may not always indicate intactness of cytoskeletal protein but shows preservation of BBB.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to assess the repeatability of the quantification of pseudo-intracellular sodium concentration (C-1) and pseudo-extracellular volume fraction (a) estimated in brain in vivo using sodium magnetic resonance (MRI) at 3 T. Eleven healthy subjects were scanned twice, with two sodium MRI acquisitions (with and without fluid suppression by inversion recovery), and two double inversion recovery (DIR) proton MRI. DIR MRIs were used to create masks of gray and white matter (GM, WM), that were subsequently applied to the C-1 and a maps calculated from sodium MRI and a tissue three-compartment model, in order to measure the distributions of these two parameters in GM, WM or full brain (GM+WM) separately. The mean, median, mode, standard deviation (std), skewness and kurtosis of the C-1 and a distributions in whole GM, WM and full brain were calculated for each subject, averaged over all data, and used as parameters for the repeatability assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as a measure of reliability for the detection of intra-subject changes in C-1 and alpha for each parameter, while intraclass correlation (ICC) was used as a measure of repeatability. It was found that the CV of most of the parameters was around 10-20% (except for C-1 kurtosis which is about 40%) for C-1 and a measurements, and that ICC was moderate to very good (0.4 to 0.9) for C-1 parameters and for some of the a parameters (mainly skewness and kurtosis). In conclusion, the proposed method could allow to reliably detect changes of 50% and above of the different measurement parameters of C-1 and ain neuropathologies (multiple sclerosis, tumor, stroke, Alzheimer's disease) compared to healthy subjects, and that skewness and kurtosis of the distributions of C-1 and aseem to be the more sensitive parameters to these changes.

N2  -  White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequently seen on T(2)-weighted MRI scans of elderly subjects with and without Alzheimers disease. WMH are only weakly and inconsistently associated with cognitive decline, which may be explained by heterogeneity of the underlying neuropathological substrates. The use of quantitative MRI could increase specificity for these neuropathological changes. We assessed whether post-mortem quantitative MRI is able to reflect differences in neuropathological correlates of WMH in tissue samples obtained post-mortem from Alzheimers disease patients and from non-demented elderly.
Thirty-three formalin-fixed, coronal brain slices from 11 Alzheimers disease patients (mean age: 83 10 years, eight females) and 15 slices from seven non-demented controls (mean age: 78 10 years, four females) with WMH were scanned at 1.5 T using qualitative (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR) and quantitative MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) including estimation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), and T(1)-relaxation time mapping based on flip-angle array). A total of 104 regions of interest were defined on FLAIR images in WMH and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Neuropathological examination included (semi-)quantitative assessment of axonal density (Bodian), myelin density (LFB), astrogliosis (GFAP) and microglial activation (HLA-DR). Patient groups (Alzheimers disease versus controls) and tissue types (WMH versus NAWM) were compared with respect to QMRI and neuropathological measures. Overall, Alzheimers disease patients had significantly lower FA (P 0.01) and higher T(1)-values than controls (P 0.04). WMH showed lower FA (P 0.01) and higher T(1)-values (P 0.001) than NAWM in both patient groups. A significant interaction between patient group and tissue type was found for the T(1) measurements, indicating that the difference in T(1)-relaxation time between NAWM and WMH was larger in Alzheimers disease patients than in non-demented controls. All neuropathological measures showed differences between WMH and NAWM, although the difference in microglial activation was specific for Alzheimers disease. Multivariate regression models revealed that in Alzheimers disease, axonal density was an independent determinant of FA, whereas T(1) was independently determined by axonal and myelin density and microglial activation. Quantitative MRI techniques reveal differences in WMH between Alzheimers disease and non-demented elderly, and are able to reflect the severity of the neuropathological changes involved.

N2  -  Objectives: To present a method for generating reference maps of typical brain characteristics of groups of subjects using a novel combination of rapid quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) and brain normalization. The reference maps can be used to detect significant tissue differences in patients, both locally and globally.
Materials and Methods: A rapid qMRI method was used to obtain the longitudinal relaxation rate (R-1), the transverse relaxation rate (R-2) and the proton density (PD). These three tissue properties were measured in the brains of 32 healthy subjects and in one patient diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The maps were normalized to a standard brain template using a linear affine registration. The differences of the mean value ofR(1), R-2 and PD of 31 healthy subjects in comparison to the oldest healthy subject and in comparison to an MS patient were calculated. Larger anatomical structures were characterized using a standard atlas. The vector sum of the normalized differences was used to show significant tissue differences.; Results: The coefficient of variation of the reference maps was high at the edges of the brain and the ventricles, moderate in the cortical grey matter and low in white matter and the deep grey matter structures. The elderly subject mainly showed significantly lower R-1 and R-2 and higher PD values along all sulci. The MS patient showed significantly lower R-1 and R-2 and higher PD values at the edges of the ventricular system as well as throughout the periventricular white matter, at the internal and external capsules and at each of the MS lesions.; Conclusion: Brain normalization of rapid qMRI is a promising new method to generate reference maps of typical brain characteristics and to automatically detect deviating tissue properties in the brain.

N2  -  In the last two decades functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has dominated research in neuroscience. However, only recently has it taken the first steps in translation to the clinical field. In this paper we describe the advantages of fMRI and DTI and the possible benefits of implementing these methods in clinical practice. We review the current clinical usages of fMRI and DTI and discuss the challenges and difficulties of translating these methods to clinical use. The most common application today is in neurosurgery. fMRI and DTI are done preoperatively for brain tumor patients who are having tumors removed and for epilepsy patients who are candidates for temporal resection. Imaging results supply the neurosurgeon with essential information regarding possible functional damage and thereby aid both in planning and performing surgery. Scientific research suggests more promising potential implementations of fMRI and DTI in improving diagnosis and rehabilitation. These advanced imaging methods can be used for pre-symptomatic diagnosis, as a differentiating biomarker in the absence of anatomical measurements, and for identification of mental response in the absence of motor-sensory abilities. These methods can aid and direct rehabilitation by predicting the success of possible interventions and rehabilitation options and by supplying a measure for biofeedback. This review opens a window to the state of the art neuroimaging methods being implemented these days into the clinical practice and provides a glance to the future clinical possibilities of fMRI and DTI.

N2  -  Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (K-trans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (v(e)) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, K-trans and v(e) maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute Delta ADC,Delta K-trans and Delta v(e) for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and K-trans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both Delta K-trans and Delta v(e) showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in K-trans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.

N2  -  Anatomical studies in animals and imaging studies in humans show that cerebral sensorimotor areas map onto corresponding cerebellar sensorimotor areas and that cerebral association areas map onto cerebellar posterior lobe regions designated as the representation of the association (cognitive and limbic) cerebellum. We report a patient with unilateral left hemispheric status epilepticus, whose brain MRI revealed diffuse unihemispheric cerebral cortical FLAIR and diffusion signal hyperintensity but spared primary motor, somatosensory, visual, and to lesser extent auditory cerebral cortices. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (dysfunction at a site remote from, but connected to, the location of the primary lesion) showed signal hyperintensity in the right cerebellar posterior lobe and lobule IX, with sparing of the anterior lobe, and lobule VIII. This unique topographic pattern of involvement and sparing of cerebral and cerebellar cortical areas matches the anatomical and functional connectivity specialization in the cerebrocerebellar circuit. This first demonstration of within-hemispheric specificity in the areas affected and spared by cerebrocerebellar diaschisis provides further confirmation in the human brain for topographic organization of connections between the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum.

N2  -  Background Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is known as a quantitative biomarker of prenatal brain maturation. Fast macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping is an emerging method for quantitative assessment of myelination that was recently adapted to fetal MRI. Purpose To compare the capability of ADC and MPF to quantify the normal fetal brain development. Study Type Prospective. Population Forty-two human fetuses in utero (gestational age [GA] = 27.7 +/- 6.0, range 20-38 weeks). Field Strength/Sequence 1.5 T; diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar spin-echo with five b-values for ADC mapping; spoiled multishot echo-planar gradient-echo with T-1, proton density, and magnetization transfer contrast weightings for single-point MPF mapping. Assessment Two operators measured ADC and MPF in the medulla, pons, cerebellum, thalamus, and frontal, occipital, and temporal cerebral white matter (WM). Statistical Tests Mixed repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors of pregnancy trimester and brain structure; Pearson correlation coefficient (r); Hotelling-Williams test to compare strengths of correlations. Results From the 2(nd) to 3(rd) trimester, ADC significantly decreased in the thalamus and cerebellum (P < 0.005). MPF significantly increased in the medulla, pons, thalamus, and cerebellum (P < 0.005). Cerebral WM had significantly higher ADC and lower MPF compared with the medulla and pons in both trimesters. MPF (r range 0.83, 0.89, P < 0.001) and ADC (r range -0.43, -0.75, P <= 0.004) significantly correlated with GA and each other (r range -0.32, -0.60, P <= 0.04) in the medulla, pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. No significant correlations or distinctions between regions and trimesters were observed for cerebral WM (P range 0.1-0.75). Correlations with GA were significantly stronger for MPF compared with ADC in the medulla, pons, and cerebellum (Hotelling-Williams test, P < 0.003) and similar in the thalamus. Structure-averaged MPF and ADC values strongly correlated (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). Data Conclusion MPF and ADC demonstrated qualitatively similar but quantitatively different spatiotemporal patterns. MPF appeared more sensitive to changes in the brain structures with prenatal onset of myelination. Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:52-61.

N2  -  Background. Radiological differentiation of tumor progression (TPR) from treatment-related changes (TRC) in pretreated glioblastoma is crucial.This study aimed to explore the diagnostic value of diffusion kurtosis MRI combined with information derived from O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET for the differentiation of TPR from TRC in patients with pretreated glioblastoma.
Methods. Thirty-two patients with histomolecularly defined and pretreated glioblastoma suspected of having TPR were included in this retrospective study. Twenty-one patients were included in the TPR group, and 11 patients in the TRC group, as assessed by neuropathology or clinicoradiological follow-up. Three-dimensional (3D) regions of interest were generated based on increased 18F-FET uptake using a tumor-to-brain ratio of 1.6. Furthermore, diffusion MRI kurtosis maps were obtained from the same regions of interest using co-registered 18F-FET PET images, and advanced histogram analysis of diffusion kurtosis map parameters was applied to generated 3D regions of interest. Diagnostic accuracy was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and combinations of PET and MRI parameters using multivariate logistic regression.; Results. Parameters derived from diffusion MRI kurtosis maps show high diagnostic accuracy, up to 88%, for differentiating between TPR and TRC. Logistic regression revealed that the highest diagnostic accuracy of 94% (area under the curve, 0.97; sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 91%) was achieved by combining the maximum tumor-tobrain ratio of 18F-FET uptake and diffusion MRI kurtosis metrics.; Conclusions. The combined use of 18F-FET PET and MRI diffusion kurtosis maps appears to be a promising approach to improve the differentiation of TPR fromTRC in pretreated glioblastoma and warrants further investigation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Thalamic gliomas are rare tumors that constitute 1%-5% of all central nervous system tumors. Despite advanced techniques and equipment, surgical resection remains challenging because of the vital structures adjacent to the tumor. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might play an active role during brain tumor surgery because it compensates for brain shift or operation-induced hemorrhage, which are challenging issues for neurosurgeons.
METHODS: We reviewed 38 patients treated surgically under intraoperative MRI guidance between January 2008 and July 2015 at our center. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative MRI scans were reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative motor power, morbidity and mortality, resection rate, surgical approach, pathologic results, and patient demographics were also reviewed.; RESULTS: Mean patient age was 37 years +- 18; 12 patients were included in the low-grade group, and 26 patients were included in the high-grade group. Under intraoperative MRI guidance, the gross total resection rate was increased from 16 (42.1%) to 26 (68.4%), and the near-total or subtotal resection rate was increased from 5 (13.2%) to 9 (23.7%). Hematoma formation was discovered in 3 patients on intraoperative MRI scan; each patient underwent a hemostatic operation immediately.; CONCLUSIONS: With improvements in neurosurgical techniques and equipment, surgical resection is considered feasible in patients with thalamic gliomas. Intraoperative MRI may be helpful in achieving the maximal resection rate with minimal surgical-related morbidity. However, because of severe disease progression, the overall prognosis is unfavorable.

N2  -  A technique is presented that allows the direct use of physiological image sets in the radiation therapy treatment planning process. When fused to the treatment planning CT, physiological image studies may allow one to define physiological tumor subvolumes consisting of areas of possible chronic hypoxia, areas of high perfusion, areas of high diffusion, and areas containing high choline concentrations. These physiological tumor subvolumes could be selectively boosted to increase local control of malignant brain tumors once one has determined which of these physiological tumor subvolumes predicts for local tumor recurrence after conventional radiotherapy.
In this technique a user assisted automatic registration technique is used that is based on an analytical estimate for the transformation matrix needed to register two rigid bodies. The only user input needed is three non-collinear points selected based on landmarks in the primary image and the corresponding three points in the secondary image. Since this registration technique uses two sets of at least three user-defined landmark points each of which has some selection error associated with it, the final registration will have an error that depends only on the selection error associated with the point sets.; Since physiological image studies are acquired at the same setting as the T1- w MRI their spatial orientation with respect to the T1- w MRI is known. Therefore, the registration of multiple physiological image studies to the treatment planning CT can be accomplished by first correlating them to the T1- w MRI, and in a second step the T1- w MRI is then registered to the treatment planning CT. The desired registration of the physiological image studies to the treatment planning CT is then accomplished by simply composing the appropriate transformation matrices.

N2  -  Objective Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic neurocutaneous syndrome with variable and unpredictable neurological comorbidity that includes epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. The degree of white matter involvement is believed to be associated with the severity of neurological impairment. The goal of the present study was to evaluate diffusion characteristics of tubers, white matter lesions, and brain structural network alterations in TSC patients using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), graph theoretical analysis (GTA), and network-based statistical (NBS) analysis. Materials and methods Forty-two patients with a definitive diagnosis of TSC were recruited for this study. All patients underwent brain DTI examination using a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging system. Mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) values, and fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping in 52 tubers and white matter lesions were measured and compared with those of contralateral normal regions. GTA was performed on the inter-regional connectivity matrix, and NBS analysis was used to identify the significance of any connected subnetworks evident in the set of altered connections. For neurological severity subgrouping, a neurological severity score was assigned to TSC patients including those with ID, seizure, autism, and other neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). Results Significantly higher MD, AD, and RD, and lower FA values, were found in TSC lesions compared with those measured in contralateral normal regions for tubers (P < 0.05). GTA and NBS analysis provided better local segregation but worse global integration of the structural network (regular-like network) in TSC patients with ID, seizure, and higher Neurological Severity Score. Disrupted subnetworks in TSC patients with severe status included connections from the frontal lobe to the parietal lobe, temporal lobe to the caudate, and temporal lobe to the insula. Discussion DTI has the potential to provide valuable information about cytoarchitectural changes in TSC lesions beyond morphological MRI findings alone. Using GTA and NBS, current results provide the information of disrupted white matter connectivity and organization in TSC patients with different neuropsychological impairments.

N2  -  Aims We investigated the usefulness of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for differentiating between histological pathologies and evaluating white matter (WM) damage resulting from brain tumors. We also sought to categorize the appearance of brain tumorrelated WM tract changes. Methods A total of 18 inpatients with intracranial neoplasms were enrolled. MRI examinations were performed at 3 similar to T using an 8-channel phased array coil. DTT was reconstruction from the raw data of diffusion tensor imaging. WM tractbased analysis of the mean diffusivity (MD), eigenvalues (?1, ?2, ?3), and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed by the manual placement of regions of interest (ROIs) on the color-coded FA maps using DTIStudio software. The axial diffusivity (DA, namely ?1) and the tensor shape (Cl, namely (?1 similar to?2)/3 (?)) were also compared between groups. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results In cases of low-grade glioma (LGG), the tracts adjacent to the tumors displayed the highest levels of invasion. Tract disruption was mainly observed in cases of high-grade glioma (HGG). We found significant differences regarding the FA, MD, DA, and radial diffusivity between ROIs in patients with LGG or HGG. There were also significant differences in DA and tensor shape (Cl) between patients with LGG and HGG. Conclusion Axial diffusivity and Cl may be useful early markers for differentiating between LGG and HGG.

N2  -  Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, and methods to improve the early detection of disease progression and evaluate treatment response are highly desirable. We therefore explored changes in whole-brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values with respect to survival (progression-free [PFS], overall [OS]) in a cohort of GBM patients followed at regular intervals until disease progression. Methods A total of 43 subjects met inclusion criteria and were analyzed retrospectively. Histogram data were extracted from standardized whole-brain ADC maps including skewness, kurtosis, entropy, median, mode, 15th percentile (p15) and 85th percentile (p85) values, and linear regression slopes (metrics versus time) were fitted. Regression slope directionality (positive/negative) was subjected to univariate Cox regression. The final model was determined by aLASSO on metrics above threshold. Results Skewness, kurtosis, median, p15 and p85 were all below threshold for both PFS and OS and were analyzed further. Median regression slope directionality best modeled PFS (p = 0.001; HR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-6.7), while p85 was selected for OS (p = 0.002; HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.13-0.64). Conclusions Our data show tantalizing potential in the use of whole-brain ADC measurements in the follow up of GBM patients, specifically serial median ADC values which correlated with PFS, and serial p85 values which correlated with OS. Whole-brain ADC measurements are fast and easy to perform, and free of ROI-placement bias.

N2  -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has variable imaging appearances, which overlap with those of glioblastoma (GBM), thereby necessitating invasive tissue diagnosis. We aimed to investigate whether a rapid filtration histogram analysis of clinical MRI data supports the distinction of PCNSL from GBM. Ninety tumours (PCNSL n = 48, GBM n = 42) were analysed using pre-treatment MRI sequences (T-1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE), T-2-weighted (T-2), and apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC)). The segmentations were completed with proprietary texture analysis software (TexRAD version 3.3). Filtered (five filter sizes SSF = 2-6 mm) and unfiltered (SSF = 0) histogram parameters were compared using Mann-Whitney U non-parametric testing, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) derived area under the curve (AUC) analysis for significant results. Across all (n = 90) tumours, the optimal algorithm performance was achieved using an unfiltered ADC mean and the mean of positive pixels (MPP), with a sensitivity of 83.8%, specificity of 8.9%, and AUC of 0.88. For subgroup analysis with >1/3 necrosis masses, ADC permitted the identification of PCNSL with a sensitivity of 96.9% and specificity of 100%. For T1CE-derived regions, the distinction was less accurate, with a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 77.1%, and AUC of 0.779. A role may exist for cross-sectional texture analysis without complex machine learning models to differentiate PCNSL from GBM. ADC appears the most suitable sequence, especially for necrotic lesion distinction.

N2  -  OBJECT Cerebral gangliogliomas (GGs) are highly associated with intractable epilepsy. Incomplete resection due to proximity to eloquent brain regions or misinterpretation of the resection amount is a strong negative predictor for local tumor recurrence and persisting seizures. A potential method for dealing with this obstacle could be the application of intraoperative high-field MRI (iopMRI) combined with neuronavigation.
METHODS Sixty-nine patients (31 female, 38 male; median age 28.5 +- 15.4 years) suffering from cerebral GGs were included in this retrospective study. Five patients received surgery twice in the observation period. In 48 of the 69 patients, 1.5-1 iopMRI combined with neuronavigational guidance was used. Lesions close to eloquent brain areas were resected with the implementation of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography and blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (15 patients).; RESULTS Overall, complete resection was accomplished in 60 of 69 surgical procedures (87%). Two patients underwent biopsy only, and in 7 patients, subtotal resection was accomplished because of proximity to critical brain areas. Excluding the 2 biopsies, complete resection using neuronavigationiopMRIwas documented in 33 of 46 cases (72%) by intraoperative imaging. Remnant tumor mass was identified intraoperatively in 13 of 46 patients (28%). After intraoperative second-look surgery, the authors improved the total resection rate by 9 patients (up to 91% 42 of 46). Of 21 patients undergoing conventional surgery, 14 (67%) had complete resection without the use of iopMRI. Regarding epilepsy outcome, 42 of 60 patients with seizures (70%) became completely seizure free (Engel Class IA) after a median follow-up time of 55.5 +- 36.2 months. Neurological deficits were found temporarily in 1 (1.4%) patient and permanently in 4 (5.8%) patients.; CONCLUSIONS Using iopMRI combined with neuronavigation in cerebral GG surgery, the authors raised the rate of complete resection in this series by 19%. Given the fact that total resection is a strong predictor of long-term seizure control, this technique may contribute to improved seizure outcome and reduced neurological morbidity.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate whether extent and severity of white matter (WM) damage, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can distinguish cognitively preserved (CP) from cognitively impaired (CI) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Methods: Conventional MRI and DTI data were acquired from 55 MS patients (35 CP, 20 CI) and 30 healthy controls (HC). Voxelwise analyses were used to investigate fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity of a WM skeleton. Regional gray matter volume was quantified and lesion probability maps were generated.; Results: Compared to HCs, decreased FA was found in 49% of the investigated WM skeleton in CP patients and in 76% of the investigated WM in CI patients. Several brain areas that showed reduced FA in both patient groups were significantly worse in CI patients, i.e, corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tracts, forceps major, cingulum, and fornices. In CI patients, WM integrity damage was additionally seen in cortical brain areas, thalamus, uncinate fasciculus, brainstem, and cerebellum. These findings were independent of lesion location and regional gray matter volume, since no differences were found between the groups.; Conclusion: CI patients diverged from CP patients only on DTI metrics. WM integrity changes were found in areas that are highly relevant for cognition in the CI patients but not in the CP patients. These WM changes are therefore thought to be related to the cognitive deficits and suggest that DTI might be a powerful tool when monitoring cognitive impairment in MS.

N2  -  Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a new promising MRI technique with microstructural sensitivity superior to conventional diffusion tensor (DTI) based methods. In stroke, considerable mismatch exists between the infarct lesion outline obtained from the two methods, kurtosis and diffusion tensor derived metrics. We aim to investigate if this mismatch can be examined in fixed tissue. Our investigation is based on estimates of mean diffusivity (MD) and mean (of the) kurtosis tensor (MKT) obtained using recent fast DKI methods requiring only 19 images. At 24 hours post stroke, rat brains were fixed and prepared. The infarct was clearly visible in both MD and MKT maps. The MKT lesion volume was roughly 31% larger than the MD lesion volume. Subsequent histological analysis (hematoxylin) revealed similar lesion volumes to MD. Our study shows that structural components underlying the MD/MKT mismatch can be investigated in fixed tissue and therefore allows a more direct comparison between lesion volumes from MRI and histology. Additionally, the larger MKT infarct lesion indicates that MKT do provide increased sensitivity to microstructural changes in the lesion area compared to MD.

N2  -  Purpose : To compare data on brain tumors derived from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging with multiple parameters obtained on dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI and to clarify the characteristics of IVIM and ASL perfusion data from the viewpoint of cerebral blood flow (CBF) analysis. Methods : ASL-CBF and IVIM techniques as well as DSC examination were performed in 24 patients with brain tumors. The IVIM data were analyzed with the two models. The relative blood flow (rBF), relative blood volume (rBV) corrected relative blood volume (crBV), mean transit time (MTT), and leakage coefficient (K2) were obtained from the DSC MRI data. Results : The ASL-CBF had the same tendency as the perfusion parameters derived from the DSC data, but the permeability from the vessels had less of an effect on the ASL-CBF. The diffusion coefficient of the fast component on IVIM contained more information on permeability than the f value. Conclusion : ASL-CBF is more suitable for the evaluation of perfusion in brain tumors than IVIM parameters. ASL-CBF and IVIM techniques should be carefully selected and the biological significance of each parameter should be understood for the correct comprehension of the pathological status of brain tumors.

N2  -  Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result from blunt trauma or acceleration/deceleration force and is considered to be one of the most important public health problems. Many patients of TBI lose professional competence and independence. They may eventually suffer serious sequelae, such as cognitive impairment, memory loss, and long-term headache. In craniocerebral trauma patients, mild traumatic brain injury accounts for 70%-80% of the cases. Early diagnosis and intervention can decrease the post-concussional sequelae for mild TBI (mTBI).
Objectives: To investigate the value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients.; Patients and Methods: Conventional MRI sequences (T1 and T2 weighted images) and DKI scans of 25 healthy controls and 24 mTBI patients were obtained. Regions of interests (ROIs) were drawn and analyzed on several planes including white matter, deep gray matter nuclei, pen-contusion and contusion lesion on fused fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD) maps, and mean kurtosis (MK) maps, respectively. FA, MD, and MK values were measured in a certain region (he area of bilateral centrum semiovale (CS), corona radiate (CR), caudate nucleus head (CNH), genu of corpus callosum (CCG), corpus callosum splenium (CCS), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), external capsule (EC), lenticular nucleus (LN), and thalamus). Student's test was used to compare the average values of FA,MD, and MK between mTBI patients and healthy controls. Paired t-test was also used to compare contusion lesions and mirror symmetrical areas.; Results: FAand MK values were significantly different in all of the white matter and grey matter, while MD values among the various ROIs were insignificantly different in the healthy control group. In mTBI patients, the FA values of genu of corpus callosum, splenium of corpus callosum, and external capsule were decreased. Whereas, MD value of genu of corpus callosum in trauma group was increased. Except for the head of the caudate nucleus and posterior limb of the internal capsule, the MK values of the rest of the ROIs in the trauma group decreased significantly. Moreover, compared with the contra-lateral, there were more significant contusion lesions of FA and MK reductions than increased MD values. FA and MD values of peri-contusion had no significant difference compared with the contra-lateral while MK values decreased significantly.; Conclusion: Compared with conventional MRI sequences, DKI can detect micro white matter injury, and MK parameter is more sensitive than FA and MD. In addition, DKI can find these changes not only in the white matter but also in deep gray matter nucleus, making it a promising imaging tool to assist the detection of mild traumatic brain injury.

N2  -  Over the last two decades, developments of human brain stroke imaging have raised several questions about the place of new MRI biomarkers in the acute management of stroke and the prediction of poststroke outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated the main role of perfusion-weighted imaging in the identification of the best cerebral perfusion profile for a better response after reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke. A major issue remains the early prediction of stroke outcome. While voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping emphasized the influence of stroke location, the analysis of the brain parenchyma underpinning the stroke lesion showed the relevance of prestroke cerebral status, including cortical atrophy, white matter integrity, or presence of chronic cortical cerebral microinfarcts. Moreover, besides the evaluation of the visually abnormal brain tissue, the analysis of normal-appearing brain parenchyma using diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer imaging or spectroscopy offered new biomarkers to improve the prediction of the prognosis and new targets to follow in therapeutic trials. The aim of this review was to depict the main new radiological biomarkers reported in the last two decades that will provide a more thorough prediction of functional, motor, and neuropsychological outcome following the stroke. These new developments in neuroimaging might be a cornerstone in the emerging personalized medicine for stroke patients.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate high-dose single fraction delivered with monochromatic X-rays minibeams for the radiotherapy of primary brain tumors in rats.
Methods and Materials: Two groups of healthy rats were irradiated with one anteroposterior minibeam incidence (four minibeams, 123 Gy prescribed dose at 1 cm depth in the brain) or two interleaved incidences (54 Gy prescribed dose in a 5 x 5 x 4.8 mm(3) volume centered in the right hemisphere), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up was performed over 1 year. T2-weighted (T2w) images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and blood vessel permeability maps were acquired. F98 tumor bearing rats were also irradiated with interleaved minibeams to achieve a homogeneous dose of 54 Gy delivered to an 8 x 8 x 7.8 mm(3) volume centered on the tumor. Anatomic and functional MRI follow-up was performed every 10 days after irradiation. T2w images, ADC, and perfusion maps were acquired.; Results: All healthy rats were euthanized 1 year after irradiation without any clinical alteration visible by simple examination. T2w and ADC measurements remain stable for the single incidence irradiation group. Localized Gd-DOTA permeability, however, was observed 9 months after irradiation for the interleaved incidences group.; The survival time of irradiated glioma bearing rats was significantly longer than that of untreated animals (49 +- 12.5 days versus 23.3 +- 2 days, p < 0.001). The tumoral cerebral blood flow and blood volume tend to decrease after irradiation.; Conclusions: This study demonstrates the sparing effect of minibeams on healthy tissue. The increased life span achieved for irradiated glioma bearing rats was similar to the one obtained with other radiotherapy techniques. This experimental tumor therapy study shows the feasibility of using X-ray minibeams with high doses in brain tumor radiotherapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Introduction The longitudinal relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1 rho) has proved to be sensitive to metabolism and useful in application to neurodegenerative diseases. However, few literature exists on its utility in gliomas. Thus, this study was conducted to explore the performance of T1 rho mapping in tumor grading and characterization of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene mutation status of gliomas.
Methods Fifty-seven patients with gliomas underwent brain MRI and quantitative measurements of T1 rho and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were recorded. Parameters were compared between high-grade gliomas (HGG) and low-grade gliomas (LGG) and between IDH1 mutant and wildtype groups.; Results HGG showed significantly higher T1 rho values in both the solid and peritumoral edema areas compared with LGG (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively), whereas no significant differences in the two areas were found for ADC (both P > 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that T1 rho value in the solid area achieved the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC, 0.841) in grading with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 81.0%. In the grade IIIII glioma group, multivariate logistic regression showed that both tumor frontal lobe location (odds ratio OR 526.608; P = 0.045) and T1 rho value of the peritumoral edema area (OR 0.863; P = 0.037) were significant predictors of IDH1 mutation. Using the combination, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for IDH1 mutated gliomas were 93.3% and 88.9%, respectively.; Conclusions Our study shows the feasibility of applying T1 rho mapping in assessing the histologic grade and IDH1 mutation status of gliomas.

N2  -  Objectives: Our aim was to investigate the impact of gray matter (GM) integrity on cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS), and its relationship with white matter (WM) integrity and presence of lesions.
Methods: Sixty-seven patients with MS and 26 healthy controls underwent voxel-based analysis of diffusion tensor images (DTI) in GM and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) from WM to identify the regional correlations between cognitive functions and integrity. Lesion probability mapping (LPM) was generated for correlation analysis with cognition. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify the imaging measures associated with cognitive scores.; Results: Compared with controls, patients showed abnormal DTI indices in several GM regions and in most WM tracts. Impairment in DTI indices in specific GM regions was associated with worse performance of distinct cognitive functions. Those regions showed anatomical correspondence with cognitively relevant tracts in TBSS and LPM. The combination of regional GM and WM DTI and lesion volume accounted for 36-51% of the variance of memory and attention scores. Regional GM DTI explained less than 5% of that variance.; Conclusion: GM and WM integrity of specific networks influences cognitive performance in MS. However, GM damage assessed by DTI only adds a small increment to the explained variance by WM in predicting cognitive functioning.

N2  -  We are getting used to referring to instrumentally detectable biological features in medical language as "imaging biomarkers". These two terms combined reflect the evolution of medical imaging during recent decades, and conceptually comprise the principle of noninvasive detection of internal processes that can become targets for supplementary therapeutic strategies. These targets in oncology include those biological pathways that are associated with several tumour features including independence from growth and growth-inhibitory signals, avoidance of apoptosis and immune system control, unlimited potential for replication, self-sufficiency in vascular supply and neoangiogenesis, acquired tissue invasiveness and metastatic diffusion. Concerning brain tumours, there have been major improvements in neurosurgical techniques and radiotherapy planning, and developments of novel target drugs, thus increasing the need for reproducible, noninvasive, quantitative imaging biomarkers. However, in this context, conventional radiological criteria may be inappropriate to determine the best therapeutic option and subsequently to assess response to therapy. Integration of molecular imaging for the evaluation of brain tumours has for this reason become necessary, and an important role in this setting is played by imaging biomarkers in PET and MRI. In the current review, we describe most relevant techniques and biomarkers used for imaging primary brain tumours in clinical practice, and discuss potential future developments from the experimental context.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - We aimed to determine the diagnostic value of perfusion computed tomography (PCT) and CT angiography (CTA) including CTA source images (CTA-SI) in comparison with perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (PWI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in acute stroke <6 hours.
Methods - Noncontrast-enhanced CT, PCT, CTA, stroke MRI, including PWI and DWI, and MR angiography (MRA), were performed in patients with symptoms of acute stroke lasting <6 hours. We analyzed ischemic lesion volumes on patients' arrival as shown on NECT, PCT, CTA-SI, DWI, and PWI ( Wilcoxon, Spearman, Bland - Altman) and compared them to the infarct extent as shown on day 5 NECT.; Results - Twenty-two stroke patients underwent CT and MRI scanning within 6 hours. PCT time to peak (PCT-TTP) volumes did not differ from PWI-TTP ( P = 0.686 for patients who did not undergo thrombolysisP = 0.328 for patients who underwent thrombolysis), nor did PCT cerebral blood volume (PCT-CBV) differ from PWI-CBV ( P = 0.893 P = 0.169). CTA-SI volumes did not differ from DWI volumes ( P = 0.465 P = 0.086). Lesion volumes measured in PCT maps significantly correlated with lesion volumes on PWI ( P = 0.0047, r = 1.0 P = 0.0019, r = 0.897 for TTP; P = 0.0054, r = 0.983P = 0.0026, r = 0.871 for CBV). Also, PCT-CBV lesion volumes significantly correlated with follow-up CT lesion volumes ( P = 0.0047, r = 1.0 P = 0.0046, r = 0.819).; Conclusions - In hyperacute stroke, the combination of PCT and CTA can render important diagnostic information regarding the infarct extent and the perfusion deficit. Lesions on PCT-TTP and PCT-CBV do not differ from lesions on PWI-TTP and PWI-CBV; lesions on CTA source images do not differ from lesions on DWI. The combination of noncontrast-enhanced CT ( NECT), perfusion CT ( PCT), and CT angiography ( CTA) can render additional information within <15 minutes and may help in therapeutic decision-making if PWI and DWI are not available or cannot be performed on specific patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reorganization of brain function may result in preservation of motor function in patients with brain tumors. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether function of the primary motor area (M1) was restored and whether motor function improved after brain tumor resection.
METHODS: Five patients with metastatic brain tumors located within or near M1 underwent awake surgery with intraoperative cortical mapping and continuous task monitoring. Preoperative and postoperative functional MR imaging (fMRI) was performed during hand clenching, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in I case to further characterize the area activated in fMRI.; RESULTS: Preoperative fMRI performed during hand clenching demonstrated reorganization of motor function. In patients with severe paresis (cases 3, 4, and 5), clenching of the affected hand induced a large blood oxygen level-dependent response in the right hemisphere, mainly in the anterior temporal lobe, despite the location site of the tumor. Postoperative fMRI during hand clenching demonstrated activation of the contralateral M1. Furthermore, in case 5, DTI detected tracts, possibly the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, arising from anterior temporal activated area as well as tracts connecting the premotor and M1 activated area. This patient demonstrated mirror movement of the hand during the course of motor function recovery.; CONCLUSIONS: Tumor resection resulted in restoration of M1 function and improved motor function in patients with preoperative reorganization of M1 function. Furthermore, the preoperative reorganization of motor function in cases with severe paresis may be related to changes in the right hemisphere, including the temporal lobe.

N2  -  Ischemic complications after resection of high-grade glioma are frequent and may constitute potential cause of false-positive results in postsurgical evaluation using F-18-fluorocholine PET/CT. On the other hand, hypoxia caused by ischemia promotes invasive glioma growth. We present 3 cases of patients with different grades of ischemic injury after resection of high-grade glioma. The combined interpretation of diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map on MRI, in this clinical setting, is mandatory to avoid PET/CT misinterpretations.

N2  -  Although there are several data analysis frameworks, both commercial and open source, supporting the detection of tumours on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sequences, none of them gives satisfactory results in the case of low volume tumors. The majority of the frameworks require the detailed analysis of at least two sequences of the examined sample, or give sample specific thresholds distinguishing between the tumor and subtypes of healthy tissue. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for the automated estimation of tumor specific cut-off values in the domain of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Once the cut-off characteristics for a particular type of tumor is estimated, their further usage on other independent samples does not require any calculations except for an easy thresholding. The proposed methodology is a combination of classical decomposition of ADC distribtution into a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with k-means clustering subsequently performed on the parameters of mixture model components, leading to the identification of ADC distributions for every tissue type. The maximum conditional probability criterion gives the final threshold estimate. The developed signal analysis pipeline was applied to the problem of GliobIastoma Multiforme grade IV brain tumor segmentation, with a dataset of 119 randomly chosen ADC maps and Leave-One-Out cross-validation procedure for population error estimate. Additionally, a comparison to standard GMM based tumor segmentation algorithms as well as to three other automated segmentation methods was performed and the obtained tumor regions were referenced to the segmentation done by a human expert. The results demonstrate the average MiMSeg similarity to the expert-curated decision measured by the Dice coefficient as equal to 89.2% (with 95% confidence interval 87.7 divided by 90.6). The MiMSeg algorithm significantly outperforms other techniques in the case of small tumors (of volume less than 10%), obtaining similarity to the expertcurated decision at the level 86.7%, with 44.9% obtained by standard GMM, 79.0% by Self Organising-Maps algorithm, 68.7% by Murakami's algorithm; and 78.2% by Kang's method.

N2  -  Objective. To prospectively determine institutional cut-off values of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and concentration of tissue metabolites measured by MR spectroscopy (MRS) for early differentiation between glioblastoma (GBM) relapse and treatment-related changes after standard treatment. Materials and Methods. Twenty-four GBM patients who received gross total resection and standard adjuvant therapy underwent MRI examination focusing on the enhancing region suspected of tumor recurrence. ADC maps, concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, lipids, and lactate, and metabolite ratios were determined. Final diagnosis as determined by biopsy or follow-up imaging was correlated to the results of advanced MRI findings. Results. Eighteen (75%) and 6 (25%) patients developed tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression, respectively. Mean time to radiographic progression from the end of chemoradiotherapy was 5.8 +/- 5.6 months. Significant differences in ADC and MRS data were observed between those with progression and pseudoprogression. Recurrence was characterized by N-acetylaspartate <= 1.5mM, choline/N-acetylaspartate >= 1.4 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 91.7%), N-acetylaspartate/creatine <= 0.7, and ADC <= 1300 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Conclusion. Institutional validation of cut-off values obtained from advanced MRI methods is warranted not only for diagnosis of GBM recurrence, but also as enrollment criteria in salvage clinical trials and for reporting of outcomes of initial treatment.

N2  -  Abnormal yawning is an underappreciated phenomenon in patients with ischemic stroke. We aimed at identifying frequently affected core regions in the supratentorial brain of stroke patients with abnormal yawning and contributing to the anatomical network concept of yawning control. Ten patients with acute anterior circulation stroke and a parts per thousand yen3 yawns/15 min without obvious cause were analyzed. The NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), symptom onset, period with abnormal yawning, blood oxygen saturation, glucose, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) were assessed for all patients. MRI lesion maps were segmented on diffusion-weighted images, spatially normalized, and the extent of overlap between the different stroke patterns was determined. Correlations between the period with abnormal yawning and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the overlapping regions, total stroke volume, NIHSS and mRS were performed. Periods in which patients presented with episodes of abnormal yawning lasted on average for 58 h. Average GCS, NIHSS, and mRS scores were 12.6, 11.6, and 3.5, respectively. Clinical parameters were within normal limits. Ischemic brain lesions overlapped in nine out of ten patients: in seven patients in the insula and in seven in the caudate nucleus. The decrease of the ADC within the lesions correlated with the period with abnormal yawing (r = -0.76, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.02). The stroke lesion intensity of the common overlapping regions in the insula and the caudate nucleus correlates with the period with abnormal yawning. The insula might be the long sought-after brain region for serotonin-mediated yawning.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The incidence of Oropharyngeal Squampus Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) cases is increasing especially in the Western countries due to the spreading of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Radiological investigations, MRI in particular, are used in the daily clinical practice to stage OPSCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of quantitative MR imaging features including diffusion-weighted imaging and human papillomavirus status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 59 patients with untreated histologically proved T2-T4 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Human papillomavirus status was determined by viral DNA detection on tissue samples. MR imaging protocol included T2-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (volumetric interpolated brain examination), and DWI sequences. Parametric maps of apparent diffusion coefficient were obtained from DWI sequences. Texture analysis was performed on T2 and volumetric-interpolated brain examination sequences and on ADC maps. Differences in quantitative MR imaging features between tumors positive and negative for human papillomavirus and among subgroups of patients stratified by smoking status were tested using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test; the false discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction; and a predictive model for human papillomavirus status was built using multivariable logistic regression.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, while 31 patients had human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Tumors positive for human papillomavirus had a significantly lower mean ADC compared with those negative for it (median, 850.87 versus median, 1033.68; P < .001). Texture features had a lower discriminatory power for human papillomavirus status. Skewness on volumetric interpolated brain examination sequences was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients positive for human papillomavirus and smokers (P = .003). A predictive model based on smoking status and mean ADC yielded a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity 92.6% in classifying human papillomavirus status.; CONCLUSIONS: ADC is significantly lower in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma positive for human papillomavirus compared with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma negative for it. ADC and smoking status allowed noninvasive prediction of human papillomavirus status with a good accuracy. These results should be validated and further investigated on larger prospective studies.

N2  -  Molecular characterization has become a key diagnostic tool for the classification and grading of primary brain tumors. Molecular markers, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion, methylation of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter, or CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion discriminate different tumor entities and grades, and play a crucial role for treatment response and prognosis. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whose main functions has been to detect a tumor, to provide spatial information for neurosurgical and radiotherapy planning, and to monitor treatment response, has shown potential in assessing molecular features of gliomas from image-based biomarkers. As an outstanding example, numerous studies have proven that the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign can identify IDH- mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted astrocytomas with a specificity of up to 100%. For other purposes, multiparametric MRI, often coupled with machine learning methods, seems to achieve the highest accuracy in predicting molecular markers. Relevant future applications might be anticipating changes in the molecular composition of gliomas and providing useful information about the cellular and genetic heterogeneity of gliomas, especially in the non-resected tumor parts.

N2  -  Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) are relatively uncommon neurological disorders, but their detection has been increasing mainly due to clinical awareness and spreading of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because these syndromes share some common clinical and radiologic features and occasionally occur in the same patient, misdiagnosis may occur. PRES is characterized by varied neurological symptoms including headache, impaired visual acuity or visual field deficit, confusion, disorders of consciousness, seizures, and motor deficits often associated to peculiar neuroradiological pattern even if uncommon localization and ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions were described. RCVS is a group of diseases typically associated with severe headaches and reversible segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, often complicated by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Pathophysiological basis of PRES and RCVS are still debated but, because they share some risk factors and clinical features, a possible common origin has been supposed. Clinical course is usually self-limiting, but prognosis may fluctuate from complete recovery to death due to complications of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. Neuroradiological techniques such as digital angiography and MRI are helpful in the diagnostic pathway and a possible prognostic role of MRI has been suggested. This review will serve to summarize clinical, neuroradiological features and controversies underlying both syndromes that may mislead the diagnostic pathway and their possible relationship with pathophysiology, clinical course, and prognosis.

N2  -  Background Posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes share many clinical, pathogenetic and radiological features, although some clinical signs are highly specific to posterior circulation strokes. Arterial stenosis and occlusions occur in significant numbers in both acute posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes, making them good candidates for endovascular treatment. Among posterior circulation strokes, basilar artery occlusions stand out because of the diagnostic and acute treatment challenges. Methods We reviewed the literature on clinical stroke syndromes and neuroimaging findings and systematically describe for each anatomical site of stroke the detailed clinical and radiological information (anatomical representation, diffusion weighted imaging and angiographic sequences). The principles of neuroimaging of posterior circulation strokes and the prognosis for each stroke localization are also discussed. Review summary Stroke syndromes in the territories of the vertebral, basilar, cerebellar, and posterior cerebral arteries are presented. Features typical of posterior circulation strokes are highlighted, including patterns of basilar artery occlusions. Clinical severity and prognosis of posterior circulation strokes are highly variable, and given that they are more difficult to detect on CT-based neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice in suspected posterior circulation strokes. Rapid identification of arterial occlusion patterns may provide prognostic information and support acute revascularization decisions. Conclusions Posterior circulation stroke syndromes tightly reflect lesion localization and arterial occlusion patterns. Although many clinical and pathogenetic features are similar to anterior circulation strokes, notable differences exist in terms of clinical presentation, stroke mechanism, prognosis, and response to acute recanalization.

N2  -  Nocardiosis is an infectious disease with wide range of clinical features, which can eventually lead to death. The agent responsible belongs to the genus Nocardia that includes about fifty different species. Nocardiosis occurs mainly in immunocompromised hosts. We report here three cases of disseminated nocardiosis misdiagnosed initially as cerebral metastatic lung cancer. These patients, including two immunocompetent hosts, presented with both pulmonary and cerebral lesions. In all three patients, the diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion sequence, apparent diffusion coefficient reconstruction and neurosurgical cerebral biopsies. Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic regimen was prolonged for several months. Progress was favorable with full resolution of the neurological symptoms and the radiological abnormalities. These three cases emphasize the diagnostic challenge of nocardiosis, especially in disseminated disease. (C) 2017 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objects Disconnection syndromes following corpus callosotomy represent complex and variably expressed groupings of signs and symptoms affecting motor control, spatial orientation, vision, hearing, and language. Little is known, however, about the functional topography of callosal fiber pathways. In addition, most published case reports and case series of corpus callosotomy seldom report neurological deficits. We sought to categorize these deficits based on surgical anatomy.
Methods We comprehensively reviewed the literature and described, compiled, and tabulated the most common disconnection syndromes complicating corpus callosotomy. We depict the topography of the cerebral cortex and associated commissural fibers of the corpus callosum through illustrations and diffusion tensor imaging tractography.; Conclusions Anatomical classification of disconnection syndromes will provide great value to neurosurgeons embarking on callosotomy, whether partial or complete. Such information will apply to procedures performed for epilepsy and to procedures where the corpus callosum is sectioned for access to lesions within the ventricular system.

N2  -  Object. Opercular glioma inferolateral to the hand/digit sensorimotor area can be resected safely using a neuronavigation system and functional brain mapping techniques. However, the surgery can still sometimes cause postoperative ischemic complications, the character of which remains unclear. The authors of this study investigated the occurrence of infarction associated with resection of opercular glioma and the arterial supply to this region.
Methods. The study involved 11 consecutive patients with gliomas located in the opercular region around the orofacial primary motor and somatosensory cortices but not involving either the handdigit area or the insula, who had been treated in their department after 1997. Both pre- and postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imagin. was performed in the nine consecutive patients after 1998 to detect ischemic complications. All patients underwent open surgery for maximum tumor resection. Postoperative MR imaging identified infarction beneath the resection cavity in all patients. Permanent motor deficits associated with infarction involving the descending motor pathway developed in two patients. Cadaveric angiography showed that the distributing arteries to the corona radiata were the long insular arteries andor medullary arteries from the opercular and cortical segments of the middle cerebral artery.; Conclusions. Subcortical resection around the upper limiting sulcus of the posterior region of the insula and wide resection in the anteroposterior and cephalocaudal directions of the opercular region were considered to be risk factors of the critical infarction. Surgeons should be aware that resection of opercular glioma can disrupt the blood supply of the corona radiata, and carries the risk of permanent motor deficits.

N2  -  Presurgical evaluation and surgery in the pediatric age group are unique in challenges related to caring for the very young, range of etiologies, choice of appropriate investigations, and surgical procedures. Accepted standards that define the criteria for levels of presurgical evaluation and epilepsy surgery care do not exist. Through a modified Delphi process involving 61 centers with experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery across 20 countries, including low-middle- to high-income countries, we established consensus for two levels of care. Levels were based on age, etiology, complexity of presurgical evaluation, and surgical procedure. Competencies were assigned to the levels of care relating to personnel, technology, and facilities. Criteria were established when consensus was reached (>= 75% agreement). Level 1 care consists of children age 9 years and older, with discrete lesions including hippocampal sclerosis, undergoing lobectomy or lesionectomy, preferably on the cerebral convexity and not close to eloquent cortex, by a team including a pediatric epileptologist, pediatric neurosurgeon, and pediatric neuroradiologist with access to video-electroencephalography and 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Level 2 care, also encompassing Level 1 care, occurs across the age span and range of etiologies (including tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge-Weber syndrome, hypothalamic hamartoma) associated with MRI lesions that may be ill-defined, multilobar, hemispheric, or multifocal, and includes children with normal MRI or foci in/abutting eloquent cortex. Available Level 2 technologies includes 3-T MRI, other advanced magnetic resonance technology including functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (tractography), positron emission tomography and/or single photon emission computed tomography, source localization with electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography, and the ability to perform intra- or extraoperative invasive monitoring and functional mapping, by a large multidisciplinary team with pediatric expertise in epilepsy, neurophysiology, neuroradiology, epilepsy neurosurgery, neuropsychology, anesthesia, neurocritical care, psychiatry, and nursing. Levels of care will improve safety and outcomes for pediatric epilepsy surgery and provide standards for personnel and technology to achieve these levels.

N2  -  Purpose
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a powerful imaging technique that has led to improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral lesions and neurosurgical guidance for tumor resection. Traditional tensor modeling, however, has difficulties in differentiating tumor-infiltrated regions and peritumoral edema. Here, we describe the supertoroidal model, which incorporates an increase in surface genus and a continuum of toroidal shapes to improve upon the characterization of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).; Materials and Methods; DTI brain datasets of 18 individuals with GBM and 18 normal subjects were acquired using a 3T scanner. A supertoroidal model of the diffusion tensor and two new diffusion tensor invariants, one to evaluate diffusivity, the toroidal volume (TV), and one to evaluate anisotropy, the toroidal curvature (TC), were applied and evaluated in the characterization of GBM brain tumors. TV and TC were compared with the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) indices inside the tumor, surrounding edema, as well as contralateral to the lesions, in the white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM).; Results; The supertoroidal model enhanced the borders between tumors and surrounding structures, refined the boundaries between WM and GM, and revealed the heterogeneity inherent to tumor-infiltrated tissue. Both MD and TV demonstrated high intensities in the tumor, with lower values in the surrounding edema, which in turn were higher than those of unaffected brain parenchyma. Both TC and FA were effective in revealing the structural degradation of WM tracts.; Conclusions; Our findings indicate that the supertoroidal model enables effective tensor visualization as well as quantitative scalar maps that improve the understanding of the underlying tissue structure properties. Hence, this approach has the potential to enhance diagnosis, preoperative planning, and intraoperative image guidance during surgical management of brain lesions.

N2  -  Background: Representations of objects and actions in everyday speech are usually materialized as nouns and verbs, two grammatical classes that constitute the core elements of language. Given their very distinct roles in singling out objects (nouns) or referring to transformative actions (verbs), they likely rely on distinct brain circuits.
Method: We tested this hypothesis by conducting network-based lesion-symptom mapping in 38 patients with chronic stroke to the left hemisphere. We reconstructed the individual brain connectomes from probabilistic tractography applied to magnetic resonance imaging and obtained measures of production of words referring to objects and actions from narrative discourse elicited by picture naming tasks.; Results: Words for actions were associated with a frontal network strongly engaging structures involved in motor control and programming. Words for objects, instead, were related to a posterior network spreading across the occipital, posterior inferior temporal, and parietal regions, likely related with visual processing and imagery, object recognition, and spatial attentionscanning. Thus, each of these networks engaged brain areas typically involved in cognitive and sensorimotor experiences equivalent to the function served by each grammatical class (e.g. motor areas for verbs, perception areas for nouns).; Conclusions: The finding that the two major grammatical classes in human speech rely on two dissociable networks has both important theoretical implications for the neurobiology of language and clinical implications for the assessment and potential rehabilitation and treatment of patients with chronic aphasia due to stroke.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Advanced imaging methods have the potential to serve as quantitative biomarkers in neuro-oncology research. However, a lack of standardization of image acquisition, processing, and analysis limits their application in clinical research. Standardization of these methods and an organized archival platform are required to better validate and apply these markers in research settings and, ultimately, in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the Comprehensive Neuro-oncology Data Repository (CONDR) is to develop a data set for assessing and validating advanced imaging methods in patients diagnosed with brain tumors. As a secondary objective, informatics resources will be developed to facilitate the integrated collection, processing, and analysis of imaging, tissue, and clinical data in multicenter clinical trials. Finally, CONDR data and informatics resources will be shared with the research community for further analysis.; METHODS: CONDR will enroll 200 patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors. Clinical, imaging, and tissue-based data are obtained from patients serially, beginning with diagnosis and continuing over the course of their treatment. The CONDR imaging protocol includes structural and functional sequences, including diffusion-and perfusion-weighted imaging. All data are managed within an XNAT-based informatics platform. Imaging markers are assessed by correlating image and spatially aligned pathological markers and a variety of clinical markers.; EXPECTED OUTCOMES: CONDR will generate data for developing and validating imaging markers of primary brain tumors, including multispectral and probabilistic maps.; DISCUSSION: CONDR implements a novel, open-research model that will provide the research community with both open-access data and open-source informatics resources.

N2  -  The aim of the present case study was to investigate the advantages of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on the real-time guidance and monitoring of a stereotactic biopsy. The study describes a patient with intracranial lesions, which were examined by conventional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging using a 1.5T intraoperative MRI system. The digital and pre-operative positron emission/computed tomography image data were transferred to a BrainLAB planning workstation, and a variety of images were automatically fused. The BrainLAB software was then used to reconstruct the corticospinal tract (CST) and create a three-dimensional display of the anatomical association between the CST and the brain lesions. A Leksell surgical planning workstation was used to identify the ideal target site and a reasonable needle track for the biopsy. The 1.5T iMRI was used to effectively monitor the intracranial condition during the brain biopsy procedure. Post-operatively, the original symptoms of the patient were not aggravated and no further neurological deficits were apparent. The histopathological diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma was made. Using high-field iMRI, the multi-image fusion-guided stereotactic brain biopsy allows for a higher positive rate of biopsy and a lower incidence of complications. The approach of combining multi-image fusion images with the frame-based stereotactic biopsy may be clinically useful for intracranial lesions of deep functional areas.

N2  -  Current radiographic response criteria for brain tumors have difficulty describing changes surrounding postoperative resection cavities. Volumetric techniques may offer improved assessment, however usually are time-consuming, subjective and require expert opinion and specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. We describe the application of a novel volumetric software algorithm that is nearly fully automated and uses standard T1 pre- and post-contrast MRI sequences. T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast images are automatically fused and normalized. The tumor region of interest is grossly outlined by the user. An atlas of the nasal mucosa is automatically detected and used to normalize levels of enhancement. The volume of enhancing tumor is then automatically calculated. We tested the ability of our method to calculate enhancing tumor volume with resection cavity collapse and when the enhancing tumor is obscured by subacute blood in a resection cavity. To determine variability in results, we compared narrowly-defined tumor regions with tumor regions that include adjacent meningeal enhancement and also compared different contrast enhancement threshold levels used for the automatic calculation of enhancing tumor volume. Our method quantified enhancing tumor volume despite resection cavity collapse. It detected tumor volume increase in the midst of blood products that incorrectly caused decreased measurements by other techniques. Similar trends in volume changes across scans were seen with inclusion or exclusion of meningeal enhancement and despite different automated thresholds for tissue enhancement. Our approach appears to overcome many of the challenges with response assessment of enhancing brain tumors and warrants further examination and validation.

N2  -  A model of transient global brain ischemia consisting of bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries for 10 min and mild hypoxia (15% O(2)-85% N(2)) for 20 rain was studied by means of MRI in young and aged Fischer 344 rats (3-4 and 24-26 months, respectively). Ischemia was assessed by full suppression of spontaneous EEG activity, which reappeared and normalized similarly in the two age-groups. The survival of young with respect to aged rats was considerably higher both at 24 h (20/20, i.e. 100% vs 12/16, i.e. 75%) and at 48 h (16/20, i.e. 80% vs 6/16, i.e. 38%). The localisation of brain lesions, their severity and progression were evaluated by a diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) sequence at 24 and 48 h post-ischemia. There were no DWI-detectable lesions in eight out of 20 young and two out of 12 aged rats. The localisation of DWI-detected lesions was rather similar in rats of the two age-groups. In fact, the cerebral cortex, mainly parietal, occipital and temporal lobes were damaged in 83% of young and 90% of aged rats. The respective percentages for the thalamus were 83 and 60%, for the striatum 58 and 50%, and for the hippocampus 25 and 30%. The lesions present in the cerebral cortex and the thalamus were considerably more severe in aged than in young rats. In conclusion, in spite of similar localisation of ischemic lesions in the two age-groups, their incidence was higher, appearance more rapid and severity more pronounced in aged with respect to young rats. This resulted in a considerably higher mortality of the former. The overall data indicate that the age issue is very important in experimental ischemia research. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  -  Tissue characterization in brain tumors and, in particular, in high-grade gliomas is challenging as a result of the co-existence of several intra-tumoral tissue types within the same region and the high spatial heterogeneity. This study presents a method for the detection of the relevant tumor substructures (i.e. viable tumor, necrosis and edema), which could be of added value for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up of individual patients. Twenty-four patients with glioma [10 low-grade gliomas (LGGs), 14 high-grade gliomas (HGGs)] underwent a multi-parametric MRI (MP-MRI) scheme, including conventional MRI (cMRI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and short-TE H-1 MRSI. MP-MRI parameters were derived: T-2, T-1 + contrast, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK) and the principal metabolites lipids (Lip), lactate (Lac), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total choline (Cho), etc. Hierarchical non-negative matrix factorization (hNMF) was applied to the MP-MRI parameters, providing tissue characterization on a patient-by-patient and voxel-by-voxel basis. Tissue-specific patterns were obtained and the spatial distribution of each tissue type was visualized by means of abundance maps. Dice scores were calculated by comparing tissue segmentation derived from hNMF with the manual segmentation by a radiologist. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each pathologic tissue source and the average feature vector within the corresponding tissue region. For the patients with HGG, mean Dice scores of 78%, 85% and 83% were obtained for viable tumor, the tumor core and the complete tumor region. The mean correlation coefficients were 0.91 for tumor, 0.97 for necrosis and 0.96 for edema. For the patients with LGG, a mean Dice score of 85% and mean correlation coefficient of 0.95 were found for the tumor region. hNMF was also applied to reduced MRI datasets, showing the added value of individual MRI modalities.

N2  -  Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neckthorax-abdomen and pelvis, including 3-phase examination of the liver, constitutes the basic imaging for primary neuroendocrine tumor (NET) diagnosis, staging, surveillance, and therapy monitoring. CT characterization of lymph nodes is difficult because of inadequate size criteria (short axis diameter), and bone metastases are often missed. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging is preferred for the examination of the liver, pancreas, brain and bone. MRI may miss small lung metastases. MRI is less well suited than CT for the examination of extended body areas because of the longer examination procedure. Ultrasonography (US) frequently provides the initial diagnosis of liver metastases and contrast-enhanced US is excellent to characterize liver lesions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. US is the method of choice to guide the biopsy needle for the histopathological NET diagnosis. US cannot visualize thoracic NET lesions for which CTguided biopsy therefore is used. Endocopic US is the most sensitive method to diagnose pancreatic NETs, and additionally allows for biopsy. Intraoperative US facilitates lesion detection in the pancreas and liver. Somatostatin receptor imaging should be a part of the tumor staging, preoperative imaging and restaging, for which 68 Ga-DOTA-somatostatin analog PET/CT is recommended, which is vastly superior to somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and facilitates the diagnosis of most types of NET lesions, for example lymph node metastases, bone metastases, liver metastases, peritoneal lesions, and primary small intestinal NETs. (18)FDG-PET/CT is better suited for G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose metabolism and less somatostatin receptor expression than low-grade NETs, and additionally provides prognostic information.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Functional neuronavigation with intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may facilitate safer brain lesion resections than conventional neuronavigation.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were used to map eloquent areas. We assessed the use of fMRI and DTT for preoperative assessments and determined whether using these data together with 3D ultrasound during surgery enabled safer lesion resection.; METHODS: We reviewed 51 consecutive patients with intracranial lesions in whom fMRI with or without DTT was used to map eloquent areas. To assess a possible impact of fMRIDTT, we reviewed and analyzed the quality of the fMRIDTT data, any change in therapeutic strategies, lesion to eloquent area distance (LEAD), extent of resection, and clinical outcome.; RESULTS: As a result of the fMRIDTT mapping, the therapeutic strategies were changed in 4 patients. The median tumor residue for glioma patients was 11% (n = 33) and 0% for nonglioma lesions (n = 12). For gliomas, there was a significant correlation between decreasing LEAD and increasing tumor residue. Of the glioma patients, 42% underwent gross total resection (>= 95%) and 12% suffered neurological worsening after surgery as a result of complications. Of glioma patients with an LEAD of <= 5 mm, 24% underwent gross total resection and 10% experienced neurological deterioration.; CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that preoperative fMRI and DTT had direct consequences for therapeutic strategies and indicates their impact on intraoperative strategies to spare eloquent cortex and tracts. Functional neuronavigation combined with intraoperative 3D ultrasound can, in most patients, enable resection of brain lesions with general anesthesia without jeopardizing neurological function.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Supratentorial tumors in the first year of life are typically large and heterogeneous at presentation, making differentiation of these CNS neoplasms on pre-operative imaging difficult. We hypothesize that the ADC value can reliably differentiate high- versus low-grade supratentorial tumors in this patient population.; MATERIALS AND METHODS:; A blinded review of ADC maps was performed on 19 patients with histologically proved supratentorial brain tumors diagnosed within the first year of life. Minimum ADC values obtained by region of interest from 2 neuroradiologists were averaged and compared with World Health Organization tumor grade. ADC values for the entire tumor were also obtained by use of a semi-automated histogram method and compared with World Health Organization tumor grade. Data were analyzed by use of Spearman rho and Student t test, with a value of P < .05 considered statistically significant.; RESULTS:; For the manual ADC values, a significant negative correlation was found between the mean minimum ADC and tumor grade (P = .0016). A significant difference was found between the mean minimum ADC of the low-grade (1.14 x 10(-3) mm(2)s +- 0.30) and high-grade tumors (0.64 x 10(-3) mm(2)s +- 0.28) (P = .0018). Likewise, the semi-automated method demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the lowest 5th (P = .0002) and 10th (P = .0009) percentile individual tumor ADC values and tumor grade, a significant difference between the mean 5th and 10th percentile ADC values of the low-grade and high-grade groups (P = .0028), and a significant positive correlation with values obtained by manual region-of-interest placement (P < .000001).; CONCLUSIONS:; ADC maps can differentiate high- versus low-grade neoplasms for supratentorial tumors presenting in the first year of life, given the significant negative correlation between ADC values and tumor grade.

N2  -  Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient's virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.

N2  -  Objects The diffusion-based spherical mean technique (SMT) provides a novel model to relate multi-b-value diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to features of tissue microstructure. We propose the first clinical application of SMT to image the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and investigate clinical feasibility and translation. Methods Eighteen MS patients and nine age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent a 3.0 Tesla scan inclusive of clinical sequences and SMT images (isotropic resolution of 2 mm). Axial diffusivity (AD), apparent axonal volume fraction (V-ax), and effective neural diffusivity (D-ax) parametric maps were fitted. Differences in AD, V-ax, and D-ax between anatomically matched regions reflecting different tissues types were estimated using generalized linear mixed models for binary outcomes. Results Differences were seen in all SMT-derived parameters between chronic black holes (cBHs) and T2-lesions (P <= 0.0016), in V-ax and AD between T2-lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) (P < 0.0001), but not between the NAWM and normal WM in HCs. Inverse correlations were seen between V-ax and AD in cBHs (r = -0.750, P = 0.02); in T2-lesions D-ax values were associated with V-ax (r = 0.824, P < 0.0001) and AD (r = 0.570, P = 0.014). Interpretations SMT-derived metrics are sensitive to pathological changes and hold potential for clinical application in MS patients.

N2  -  Background: Acute infarction patterns have been described in cardioembolic stroke, mainly with atrial fibrillation (AF) or patent foramen ovale. We aimed to analyse acute infarction magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in stroke patients with intracardiac thrombus (ICT) compared with stroke patients with AF. Methods: We performed a retrospective study analysing brain MRI scans of consecutive acute symptomatic cardioembolic infarction patients associated with ICT or AF who were recruited and registered in the stroke database between June 2018 and November 2019. Diffusion-weighted imaging performed within 1 week after symptom onset, intra-/extracranial vessel imaging, echocardiography, and >= 24-h ECG monitoring were required for inclusion. Baseline, biological, and echocardiography characteristics were assessed. Analysed MRI characteristics were infarction location (anterior/middle/posterior cerebral artery territory; anterior/posterior/mixed anterior-posterior circulation; multiterritorial infarction; brainstem; cerebellum; small cortical cerebellar infarctions [SCCIs] or non-SCCI; cortical/subcortical/cortico-subcortical), lesion number, subcortical lesion size (> or <15 mm), and total infarction volume. Results: We included 28 ICT and 94 AF patients presenting with acute stroke. ICT patients were younger (median age 66 vs. 81 years, p < 0.001), more frequently male (79 vs. 47%, p = 0.003), and smokers (39 vs. 17%, p = 0.013), had more frequent history of diabetes (36 vs. 18%, p = 0.049) and ischaemic heart disease (57 vs. 21%, p < 0.001), and had lower HDL cholesterol levels (0.39 vs. 0.53 g/L, p < 0.001). On MRI, SCCI was more frequent in the ICT group (25 vs. 5%, p = 0.006) in the absence of other differences in infarction localisation, number, size, or volume on MRI. On multivariate analysis, younger age (p < 0.001), history of ischaemic heart disease (p < 0.001), and low HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with ICT. Results approaching statistical significance were observed for SCCI (more frequent in the ICT group, p = 0.053) and non-SCCI (more frequent in the AF group, p = 0.053) on MRI. Conclusions: ICT-related stroke is associated with acute SCCI presence on MRI.

Chelation therapy is used to 'de-copper' patients but neurological outcomes remain unpredictable. A range of neuroimaging abnormalities have been described and may provide insights into disease mechanisms, in addition to prognostic and monitoring biomarkers. Previous quantitative MRI analyses have focused on specific sequences or regions of interest, often stratifying chronically treated patients according to persisting symptoms as opposed to initial presentation. In this cross-sectional study, we performed a combination of unbiased, whole-brain analyses on T-1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted and susceptibility-weighted imaging data from 40 prospectively recruited patients with Wilson's disease (age range 16-68). We compared patients with neurological (n = 23) and hepatic (n = 17) presentations to determine the neuroradiological sequelae of the initial brain injury. We also subcategorized patients according to recent neurological status, classifying those with neurological presentations or deterioration in the preceding 6 months as having 'active' disease. This allowed us to compare patients with active (n = 5) and stable (n = 35) disease and identify imaging correlates for persistent neurological deficits and copper indices in chronically treated, stable patients. Using a combination of voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest volumetric analyses, we demonstrate that grey matter volumes are lower in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex when comparing patients with neurological and hepatic presentations. In chronically treated, stable patients, the severity of neurological deficits correlated with grey matter volumes in similar, predominantly subcortical regions. In contrast, the severity of neurological deficits did not correlate with the volume of white matter hyperintensities, calculated using an automated lesion segmentation algorithm. Using tract-based spatial statistics, increasing neurological severity in chronically treated patients was associated with decreasing axial diffusivity in white matter tracts whereas increasing serum non-caeruloplasmin-bound ('free') copper and active disease were associated with distinct patterns of increasing mean, axial and radial diffusivity. Whole-brain quantitative susceptibility mapping identified increased iron deposition in the putamen, cingulate and medial frontal cortices of patients with neurological presentations relative to those with hepatic presentations and neurological severity was associated with iron deposition in widespread cortical regions in chronically treated patients. Our data indicate that composite measures of subcortical atrophy provide useful prognostic biomarkers, whereas abnormal mean, axial and radial diffusivity are promising monitoring biomarkers. Finally, deposition of brain iron in response to copper accumulation may directly contribute to neurodegeneration in Wilson's disease.

N2  -  Background: Gliomas are frequent tumors of brain parenchyma, which have histology similar to that of glial cells. Accurate glioma grading is required for determining clinical management. The background of this study is to investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomic features extracted from multiple MRI sequences in differentiating low and high-grade gliomas.
Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study. It includes two groups. Group A includes patients with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of low (23) and high-grade (58) gliomas from 2012 to 2020 were included. The MRI images were acquired using a Signa HDxt 1.5 Tesla MRI (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, USA). Group B includes an external test set consisting of low- (20) and high-grade gliomas (20) obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The radiomic features were extracted from axial T2, apparent diffusion coefficient map, axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and axial T1 post-contrast sequences for both the groups. The Mann - Whitney U test was performed to assess the significant radiomic features useful for distinguishing the glioma grades for Group A. To determine the accuracy of radiomic features for differentiating gliomas, AUC was calculated from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for both groups.; Results: Our study noticed in Group A, fourteen MRI-based radiomic features from four MRI sequences showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) in differentiating gliomas. In Group A, we noticed T1 post-contrast radiomic features such as first-order variance (FOV) (sensitivity - 94.56%, specificity - 97.51%, AUC - 0.969) and GLRLM long-run gray-level emphasis (sensitivity - 97.54%), specificity - 96.53%, AUC - 0.972) had the highest discriminative power for distinguishing the histological subtypes of gliomas. Our study noticed no statistical significant difference between ROC curves of significant radiomic features for both groups. In Group B, the T1 post-contrast radiomic features such as FOV (AUC-0.933) and GLRLM long-run gray-level emphasis (AUC-0.981) had also shown high discriminative power for distinguishing the gliomas.; Conclusion: Our study concludes that MRI-based radiomic features extracted from multiple MRI sequences provide a non-invasive diagnosis of low- and high-grade gliomas and can be implemented in clinical settings for diagnosing the glioma grades.

N2  -  High grade and metastatic brain tumours exhibit considerable spatial variations in proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, necrosis and oedema. Vascular heterogeneity arising from vascular co-option in regions of invasive growth (in which the blood-brain barrier remains intact) and neoangiogenesis is a major challenge faced in the assessment of brain tumours by conventional MRI. A multiparametric MRI approach, incorporating native measurements and both Gd-DTPA (Magnevist) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (P904)-enhanced imaging, was used in combination with histogram and unsupervised cluster analysis using a k-means algorithm to examine the spatial distribution of vascular parameters, water diffusion characteristics and invasion in intracranially propagated rat RG2 gliomas and human MDA-MB-231 LM2-4 breast adenocarcinomas in mice. Both tumour models presented with higher R-1 (the change in transverse relaxation rate R-1 induced by Gd-DTPA), fractional blood volume (fBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient than uninvolved regions of the brain. MDA-MB-231 LM2-4 tumours were less densely cellular than RG2 tumours and exhibited substantial local invasion, associated with oedema, whereas invasion in RG2 tumours was minimal. These additional features were reflected in the more heterogeneous appearance of MDA-MB-231 LM2-4 tumours on T-2-weighted images and maps of functional MRI parameters. Unsupervised cluster analysis separated subregions with distinct functional properties; areas with a low fBV and relatively impermeable blood vessels (low R-1) were predominantly located at the tumour margins, regions of MDA-MB-231 LM2-4 tumours with relatively high levels of water diffusion and low vascular permeability and/or fBV corresponded to histologically identified regions of invasion and oedema, and areas of mismatch between vascular permeability and blood volume were identified. We demonstrate that dual contrast MRI and evaluation of tissue diffusion properties, coupled with cluster analysis, allows for the assessment of heterogeneity within invasive brain tumours and the designation of functionally diverse subregions that may provide more informative predictive biomarkers.

The scanner provides intrinsic optical contrasts to distinguish the cerebellar cortical layers and white matter. Images from serial scans reveal the large-scale anatomy in detail and map the nerve fiber pathways in the cerebellum and brainstem. By incorporating a water-immersion microscope objective, we also present high-resolution tiled images that delineate fine structures in the cerebellum and brainstem.

N2  -  This paper reports an 65-year-old woman with nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis. On MRI and diffusion MRI, diffuse and symmetrical, bilateral high-signal lesions were evident in the medial temporal lobes. The affected areas were hyperintense on b = 1000 s/mm(2) (heavily diffusion-weighted or true diffusion) images, a pattern similar to cytotoxic edema. However, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values read directly from corresponding ADC maps at each temporal lobe were within normal limits: 0.96 and 0.97 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, excluding cytotoxic edema, The changes were shown to be resolved on a 9-month follow-up MRI.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Brain radiotherapy is limited in part by damage to white matter, contributing to neurocognitive decline. We utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with multiple b-values (diffusion weightings) to model the dose-dependency and time course of radiation effects on white matter.
Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with high-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy underwent MRI with DTI prior to radiotherapy, and after months 1, 4-6, and 9-11. Diffusion tensors were calculated using three weightings (high, standard, and low b-values) and maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)), and radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)) were generated. The region of interest was all white matter.; Results: MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to) increased significantly with time and dose, with corresponding decrease in FA. Greater changes were, seen at lower b-values, except for FA. Time-dose interactions were highly significant at 4-6 months and beyond (p <.001), and the difference in dose response between high and low b-values reached statistical significance at 9-11 months for MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to) (p <.001, p <.001, p =.005 respectively) as well as at 4-6 months for lambda(parallel to) (p =.04).; Conclusions: We detected dose-dependent changes across all doses, even <10 Gy. Greater changes were observed at low b-values, suggesting prominent extracellular changes possibly due to vascular permeability and neuroinflammation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Background Mapping the hypoxic brain in acute ischemic stroke has considerable potential for both diagnosis and treatment monitoring. PET using F-18-fluoro-misonidazole (FMISO) is the reference method; however, it lacks clinical accessibility and involves radiation exposure. MR-based T2 mapping may identify tissue hypoxia and holds clinical potential. However, its validation against FMISO imaging is lacking. Here we implemented back-to-back FMISO-PET and T2 MR in rodents subjected to acute middle cerebral artery occlusion. For direct clinical relevance, regions of interest delineating reduced T2 signal areas were manually drawn.
Methods Wistar rats were subjected to filament middle cerebral artery occlusion, immediately followed by intravenous FMISO injection. Multi-echo T2 and T2* sequences were acquired twice during FMISO brain uptake, interleaved with diffusion-weighted imaging. Perfusion-weighted MR was also acquired whenever feasible. Immediately following MR, PET data reflecting the history of FMISO brain uptake during MR acquisition were acquired. T2 maps were generated voxel-wise from T2 and T2*. Two raters independently drew T2 lesion regions of interest. FMISO uptake and perfusion data were obtained within T2 consensus regions of interest, and their overlap with the automatically generated FMISO lesion and apparent diffusion coefficient lesion regions of interest was computed.; Results As predicted, consensus T2 lesion regions of interest exhibited high FMISO uptake as well as substantial overlap with the FMISO lesion and significant hypoperfusion, but only small overlap with the apparent diffusion coefficient lesion. Overlap of the T2 lesion regions of interest between the two raters was approximate to 50%.; Conclusions This study provides formal validation of T2 to map non-core hypoxic tissue in acute stroke. T2 lesion delineation reproducibility was suboptimal, reflecting unclear lesion borders.

N2  -  White matter, which constituted the anatomical connections between brain regions, accounted for approximately 50% of the human brain. The crucial role of the intact white matter connections for normal brain function has been described by extensive lesion and anatomic studies. Although traditional structural techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can successfully explore the white matter architecture, they failed to uncover neural activity and dynamics occurring in white matter. Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) is a noninvasive technique to map brain activation and connectivity. Previous BOLD-fMRI studies primarily focused on spontaneous activity in gray matter rather than that in white matter, since white matter I 1 activation remained controversial. However, the evidence is accumulating for activation in white matter. This paper reviewed former researches on spontaneous activity in white matter, including physiological bases, neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling, brain activation, and brain connectivity. Despite the differences observed in vascular density between gray matter and white matter, BOLD effects in white matter were reported to be related to neural activity. Robust BOLD activations were detected in the posterior limb of internal capsule, anterior corpus callosum, etc. The power spectrum of resting-state white matter BOLD signals was associated with white matter density and fraction anisotropy (FA) rather than random distribution as noise. Besides, regarding to the functional connectivity of white matter, it was well established that white matter manifested an intrinsic functional organization as interacting networks of functional modules. Moreover, the functional networks of white matter were closely related to that of gray matter and white matter tracts. Several brain disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, Alzheimer' s and Parkinson disease, were characterized by functional connectivity abnormalities of white matter. Finally, the recommendations and suggestions for future study were included on the neurophysiological basis of white matter BOLD-fMRI signal using multimode imaging data and the common abnormalities in white matter across multiple psychiatric disorders.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the white matter of the brain by means of the fiber-dissection technique and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging to assess the usefulness of the combination of both techniques, compare their results, and review the potential functional role of fiber tracts.
METHODS: Fifteen formalin-fixed human hemispheres were dissected according to Klingler's fiber-dissection technique with the aid of X6 to X40 magnification. Three-dimensional anatomic images were created with the use of specific software. Two hundred patients with neurological symptoms and five healthy volunteers were studied with diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (3 T) and tractographic reconstruction.; RESULTS: The most important association, projection, and commissural fasciculi were identified anatomically and radiologically. Analysis of their localization, configuration, and trajectory was enhanced by the combination of both techniques. Three-dimensional anatomic reconstructions provided a better perception of the spatial relationships among the white matter tracts. Tractographic reconstructions allowed for inspection of the relationships between the tracts as well as between the tracts and the intracerebral lesions. The combination of topographical anatomic studies of human fiber tracts and neuroanatomic research in experimental animals, with data from the clinicoradiological analysis of human white matter lesions and intraoperative subcortical stimulation, aided in establishing the potential functional role of the tracts.; CONCLUSION: The fiber-dissection and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging he techniques are reciprocally enriched not only in their application to the study of the complex intrinsic architecture of the brain, but also in their practical use for diagnosis and surgical planning.

N2  -  Extracerebral tumors often occur on the surface of the brain or at the skull base. It is important to identify the peritumoral sulci, gyri, and nerve fibers. Preoperative visualization of three-dimensional (3D) multimodal fusion imaging (MFI) is crucial for surgery. However, the traditional 3D-MFI brain models are homochromatic and do not allow easy identification of anatomical functional areas. In this study, 33 patients with extracerebral tumors without peritumoral edema were retrospectively recruited. They underwent 3D T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and CT angiography (CTA) sequence scans. 3DSlicer, Freesurfer, and BrainSuite were used to explore 3D-color-MFI and preoperative planning. To determine the effectiveness of 3D-color-MFI as an augmented reality (AR) teaching tool for neurosurgeons and as a patient education and communication tool, questionnaires were administered to 15 neurosurgery residents and all patients, respectively. For neurosurgical residents, 3D-color-MFI provided a better understanding of surgical anatomy and more efficient techniques for removing extracerebral tumors than traditional 3D-MFI (P < 0.001). For patients, the use of 3D-color MFI can significantly improve their understanding of the surgical approach and risks (P < 0.005). 3D-color-MFI is a promising AR tool for extracerebral tumors and is more useful for learning surgical anatomy, developing surgical strategies, and improving communication with patients.

N2  -  A 64-year-old obese man developed hypesthesia in the left arm and leg. Neurological examination revealed decreased senses of pain, touch, and temperature in the left face, arm, trunk, and leg. Remaining functions were normal. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Somatosensory-evoked potentials using the stimulation in the median nerve were normal on both sides. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarction in the right parietal operculum and insula. There were no pathognomonic lesions in the postcentral gyrus, the thalamus, or the brain stem. Cardioembolic operculo-insular infarction was diagnosed. Diffusion tensor tractography map displayed the thalamocortical projections to the primary and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). These radiological findings supported that the operculo-insular lesion could disrupt the thalamo-S2 pathway. Thus, the thalamocortical disconnection between the thalamus to the S2 could cause superficial hemisensory dysfunction in the present patient.

N2  -  ISODATA using MRI parameter-weighted images has been previously employed to characterize ischemic cell damage after stroke in rats. In an effort to increase the objectivity and to further automate the ISODATA, MRI parameter maps were now employed. Male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic stroke and received treatment via a femoral vein at 4 h post-stroke. The control rats received saline and were sacrificed at 6, 24 and 48 h after stroke, respectively. Treated rats received rtPA alone or were treated with a combination of rtPA and an antibody, 7E3 F(ab')(2), against the glycoprotein receptor that binds the platelet to fibrin. These rats were sacrificed at 24, or 48, h post-stroke. T-1, T-2 and diffusion maps were employed for map ISODATA analysis. H&E histological analysis of coronal sections of tissue was performed and compared with map ISODATA from the corresponding sections. ISODATA signatures were highly correlated (R similar to 0.80, P < 0.0001) with the ischemic cell damage analyzed at 6, 24 and 48 h post-stroke. At 24 and 48 h after stroke, ISODATA lesion sizes were highly correlated (R > 0.97, P < 0.001) with lesion sizes measured histologically. The combination treatment of rtPA and 7E3 F(ab')(2) reduced both infarction size (P < 0.002) and average signature (P < 0.03) at 48 h after stroke, compared to saline-treated animals. No significant difference was found between saline and rtPA-alonetreated rats. The map ISODATA successfully provides objective and automated quantitation of the ischemic damage in both size and severity in an embolic stroke model of rat with and without a therapeutic intervention.

T2  -  CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY

N2  -  Treatment of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) should begin with thorough evaluation by a specialized multidisciplinary team to determine whether or not the patient is appropriate for surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Particular attention should be paid to the performance status and neurological function. Surgery is the first step in therapeutic intervention. Patients undergo either biopsy, debulking surgery or maximal resection depending on the anatomical location of the tumour and the patient's clinical condition. Extent of resection has a prognostic value. In patients who are 'fit for surgery', the aim is to remove all contrast-enhancing tumour without causing neurological deficit. If microsurgical resection is not feasible, then a biopsy, either open or stereotactic, should be performed to confirm high-grade glioma diagnosis and to perform molecular genetic analyses (MGMT methylation status, loss of heterozygosity in 1p/19q, IDH1 status) as this has treatment implications. Over the past decade, much glioma research has focussed on novel surgical approaches to improve long-term outcomes. The evidence to support the benefit of maximizing extent of resection is growing. Advances in neurosurgical techniques allow safer, more aggressive surgery to maximize tumour resection whilst minimizing neurological deficit. Surgical adjuncts including advanced neuronavigation, intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, high-frequency ultrasonography, fluorescence-guided microsurgery using intraoperative fluorescence, functional mapping of motor and language pathways, and locally delivered therapies are extending the armamentarium of the neurosurgeon to provide patients with the best outcome. Operating on elderly patients and those with recurrent disease, although controversial, is becoming more common due to emerging neurosurgical approaches. Here, we discuss the emerging surgical techniques and comment on the future of HGG surgery.

N2  -  Background: The aim of this study was to assess infarct localization, clinical signs, and prognostic factors in cases with unilateral symptomatic total internal carotid occlusion. Methods: In total, 101 patients who had a diagnosis of symptomatic unilateral carotid occlusion in the Department of Neurology, Trakya University Faculty of Medicine, between January 2008 and May 2012, were included in this study. The relationship between infarct localizations and prognosis of patients was evaluated by cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI. The condition of ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) was assessed by cranial and cervical magnetic resonance angiography besides opposite carotid. Patients were evaluated by modified Rankin Scale in terms of prognosis at discharge and after 3 months. Furthermore, they were evaluated in terms of risk factors, such as cigarette and alcohol use, presence of temporary ischemic attack and stroke history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. Results: Territorial infarct was commonly seen as acute ischemic stroke pattern especially in cases with a poor MCA circulation and insufficient collateral circulation. Development of territorial stroke, occlusion of MCA, and nonvisualization of PCoA were found to be associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions: In unilateral symptomatic intracranial carotid artery occlusion, poor prognosis and high mortality-associated territorial stroke pattern is frequently observed. Besides, presence of severe stenosis or occlusion and absence of collateral circulation in MCA are associated with poor prognosis.

N2  -  BACKGROUND Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has recently shown promise in differentiating ring-enhancing lesions such as brain abscess and malignant neoplasm. The ability of DWI to strongly suggest brain abscess enables a neurosurgeon to alter stereotactic planning to optimize diagnosis. We report our experience with DWI in 5 patients with lesions on MR imaging and review the literature to assess the usefulness of this technique in the preoperative evaluation of cerebral abscess.
METHODS The MR images of 5 patients presenting with ring-enhancing lesions that ultimately proved to be brain abscesses were retrospectively reviewed. In addition to standard MR sequences, trace DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculations were performed on all patients. Additionally, 15 recently published articles or references in press concerning DWI in cerebral abscesses were reviewed.; RESULTS All lesions were markedly hyperintense on DWI and had diminished ADC. Thirty-eight of 39 previously reported abscesses were hyperintense on DWI with reduced ADC. Of 165 nonpyogenic lesions with DWI findings, 87 were hypointense or isointense, 78 lesions had variable hyperintensities, and few manifested the degree of hyperintensity observed with abscesses. Most of these included chordomas and epidermoids, which are not likely to be confused with abscesses.; CONCLUSIONS Restricted water diffusion, as indicated by hyperintensity on DWI and low ADC, in ring-enhancing lesions assists in differentiating brain abscess from necrotic tumor. This information facilitates stereotactic surgical planning: abscesses should be preferentially centrally aspirated, whereas necrotic brain tumors should have diagnostic tissue biopsied from cavity walls. Although not definitive for brain abscess, restricted water diffusion is an important MR imaging sign and is useful in neurosurgical treatment strategies for ring-enhancing lesions.

N2  -  Object. The utility of subcortical electrical stimulation and fiber tracking were compared to estimate the pyramidal tract near brain tumors.
Methods. In 22 patients, the white matter at the bottom of a tumor was electrically stimulated near the fiber tracking of the pyramidal tract shown on a neuronavigation system. The distance between the center of the fiber tracking of these tracts and the stimulated region was measured and defined as the motor evoked potential (MEP) response. The MEP was consistently produced at distances less than 7 min (six patients), but was consistently absent at distances more than 13 mm (seven patients) from the fiber tracking of the pyramidal tracts. In the nine patients in whom the distance was between 8 and 12 mm, an MEP was elicited when stimulation was applied at the level of the corona radiata. Motor function was preserved or even improved with appropriate tumor resection in all patients.; Conclusions. The anteroposteriorly running superior longitudinal fasciculus could cause complications in the fiber tracking of upper-extremity motor pathways at the level of the corona radiata. During resection of tumors located near the corona radiata, subcortical electrical stimulation should be applied at some distance from the pyramidal tract, as estimated by fiber tracking.

N2  -  We applied multislice, whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to two patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. Data were analyzed using DTI-based, color-coded images and a 3-D tract reconstruction technique for the study of altered white matter anatomy. Each tumor was near two major white matter tracts, namely, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the corona radiata. Those tracts were identified using the color-coded maps, and spatial relationships with the tumors were characterized. In one patient the tumor displaced adjacent white matter tracts, whereas in the other it infiltrated the superior longitudinal fasciclus without displacement of white matter. DTI provides new information regarding the detailed relationship between tumor growth and nearby white matter tracts, which may be useful for preoperative planning.

N2  -  Fiber tracking is increasingly used to plan and guide neurosurgical procedures of intracranial tumors in the vicinity of functionally important areas of the brain. However, valid data concerning the reliability of tracking with respect to the actual pathoanatomical situation are lacking. We retrospectively correlated fiber tracking based on magnetic resonance (MR) DT imaging with the histopathological data of 25 patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas. Fiber tracking using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) method was performed to investigate the integrity of white matter tracts in the surrounding border zone of the lesions. The tracking procedure was stopped when fractional anisotropy (FA) thresholds=0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3, or a tract turning angle > 60 degrees were encountered. In 9 patients we were able to reconstruct brain fiber tracts at biopsy loci (2-32% tumor infiltration) using an FA threshold of 0.15 and 0.2, but not for a threshold of 0.25 or 0.3. The neurological outcome demonstrated potential tumor cell infiltration of functionally intact brain fiber tracts in the range of 2-8%. These findings may be useful in planning therapeutic approaches to gliomas in the vicinity of eloquent brain regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the relationship between clinical stages and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes in the brain of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).
Materials and Methods: A total of 18 patients with stage II (N = 11) and III (N = 7) SSPE and 11 age-matched controls underwent routine MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The ADC values were automatically calculated. Seven distinct neuroanatomic structures (frontal, parieto-occipital, and cerebellar white matter: deep white matter; thalamus: basal ganglia; and brainstem) were selected for analysis In the patient and control groups.; Results: Hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matters on T2-weighted images and ADC maps were detected in 63.6% of patients with stage II and in all patients with stage III. There were significant differences between stage II and III patients and also between patients and control group in ADC values that obtained from all locations. The highest mean ADC values were calculated in stage III patients. Although MRI and DWI findings were normal in four patients with stage II disease, ADC values were significantly increased when compared with controls.; Conclusion: The stage of disorder may be independent of DWI appearance during the early stage (stages I and II), even though the brain is affected. Therefore. DWI and ADC values supplemental to routine MRI should also be utilized for lesion detection and definition to enhance diagnostic accuracy in patients with SSPE.

N2  -  Background and Purpose. When performed soon after stroke onset, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with hexamethylpropylenamine oxime or Tc 99m L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) has significant added predictive value compared to neurological scores. With ECD SPECT, the degree of tracer uptake reduction predicts neurological recovery, and using a 40% threshold to characterize irreversibly damaged tissue (IDT), significant correlations have been observed. However, correlations between this uptake threshold and tissue outcomes have not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to validate the 40% ECD uptake threshold for the probabilistic mapping of IDT using an automatic, voxel-based approach. Methods. In 10 acute stroke patients, the authors first compared early ECD SPECT and late coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and assessed for IDT and "tissue at risk" (ie, tissue with ECD uptake below and above 40%) the percentage of voxels ultimately infarcted and noninfarcted on late brain MRI. They then assessed the correlations between the volumes of brain tissue compartments and subsequent neurological recovery. Finally, to assess whether visual SPECT analysis is reliable compared to the more complex voxel-based approach, the authors compared the predictive value of the 2 methods for neurological recovery. Results. The majority of IDT voxels (average = 84%), defined by ECD uptake < 40%, evolved toward infarction, and 51.8% to 100% of at-risk voxels (average = 89%) escaped infarction. The extent of IDT correlated significantly with neurological recovery (P =.0009). There was good agreement between visual and voxel-based analyses (P =.0004). Conclusion. The results support the validity of the ECD uptake thresholds chosen, suggesting that ECD uptake can reflect neuronal viability and that ECD SPECT can be useful for the early detection of potentially salvageable tissue and irreversible damage. These preliminary results encourage the use of this method in a clinical setting for fast decision making in choosing acute therapy.

N2  -  We have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to characterise a rat model of thromboembolic stroke. The consequences of acute perfusion deficit associated with a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by a newly formed thrombus was mapped by interrogation of the tissue oxygenation status using gradient echo methods and production of T2* maps. Final infarct size was subsequently assessed at 24-h post-ischaemia by histology with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Animals displayed an infarct volume of 178.7 +/- 84.2 mm(3) (mean +/-S.D.) with a large coefficient of variation (47%) and range of values (85.6-265.5 mm(3)). This variability provided us with an opportunity to assess the relationships between early imaging observations and eventual infarct size. For a single cerebral slice, at the centre of the MCA territory, a relationship between the area of reduced T2* at 1 and 2 h post MCAo correlated highly with final lesion area (Spearman rank correlation, r=0.98. P<0.01. n=9). Lesion volumes in the thromboembolic MCAo model were compared with a 120-min occlusion. 22-h reperfusion protocol using an intraluminal thread MCAo approach. For the thromboembolic model. the total lesion volume was found to be smaller (178.7<plus/minus>84.2 vs. 243.3 +/- 50.1 mm(3), mean +/-S.D., Student's t-test P=0.046) and showed a greater variability (coefficient of variations: 47% vs. 21%). These data underline the relative variability of this embolic model and provide important preliminary information regarding the value of early changes in T2* in predicting eventual infarct size.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical value of arterial spin-labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) through comparison with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) enhanced perfusion MRI.
Methods-Pseudocontinuous ASL with 3-dimensional background-suppressed gradient and spin echo readout was applied with DSC perfusion MRI on 26 patients with AIS. ASL cerebral blood flow and multiparametric DSC perfusion maps were rated for image quality and lesion severityconspicuity. Mean ASL cerebral blood flow and DSC perfusion values were obtained in main vascular territories. Kendall coefficient of concordance was calculated to evaluate the reliability of ratings. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to compare ratings and quantitative perfusion values between ASL and DSC perfusion maps.; Results-ASL cerebral blood flow and DSC perfusion maps provided largely consistent results in delineating hypoperfused brain regions in AIS. Hyperemic lesions, which also appeared frequently in the AIS cases studied, were more conspicuous on ASL cerebral blood flow than on DSC cerebral blood flow, mean transit time and time to the maximum of the tissue residual function maps.; Conclusions-As a rapid, noninvasive, and quantitative technique, ASL has clinical use in detecting blood flow abnormalities in patients with AIS.

N2  -  Intracranial abscessation is a life-threatening condition in dogs and cats, and rapid diagnosis is important for prognosis and treatment planning. The aims of this retrospective, single-center, case series study were to describe clinical and MRI diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics in three dogs and three cats with presumed or confirmed intracranial abscessation. All lesions appeared hyperintense on b1000 trace diffusion-weighted images, hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, with mean ADC values ranging from 0.37 to 1.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The majority (5/6) of the obtained mean ADC values were low (<1.10 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), as previously reported in the human literature.

N2  -  In the last decade, the clinical applications of three-dimensional (3D) printed models, in the neurosurgery field among others, have expanded widely based on several technical improvements in 3D printers, an increased variety of materials, but especially in postprocessing software. More commonly, physical models are obtained from a unique imaging technique with potential utilization in presurgical planning, generation/creation of patient-specific surgical material and personalized prosthesis or implants. Using specific software solutions, it is possible to obtain a more accurate segmentation of different anatomical and pathological structures and a more precise registration between different medical image sources allowing generating hybrid computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3D printed models. The need of neurosurgeons for a better understanding of the complex anatomy of central nervous system (CNS) and spine is pushing the use of these hybrid models, which are able to combine morphological information from CT and MRI, and also able to add physiological data from advanced MRI sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and functional MRI (fMRI). The inclusion of physiopathological data from advanced MRI sequences enables neurosurgeons to identify those areas with increased biological aggressiveness within a certain lesion prior to surgery or biopsy procedures. Preliminary data support the use of this more accurate presurgical perspective, to select the better surgical approach, reduce the global length of surgery and minimize the rate of intraoperative complications, morbidities or patient recovery times after surgery. The use of 3D printed models in neurosurgery has also demonstrated to be a valid tool for surgeons training and to improve communication between specialists and patients. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of this novel approach in common clinical practice and determine the degree of improvement the neurosurgeons receive and the potential impact on patient outcome.

N2  -  To achieve optimal survival and quality of life outcomes in patients with glioma, the extent of tumor resection must be maximized without causing injury to eloquent structures. Preservation of language function is of particular importance to patients and requires careful mapping to reveal the locations of cortical language hubs and their structural and functional connections. Within this language network, accurate mapping of eloquent white matter tracts is critical, given the high risk of permanent neurological impairment if they are injured during surgery. In this review, we start by describing the clinical implications of gliomas involving white matter language tracts. Next, we highlight the advantages and limitations of methods commonly used to identify these tracts during surgery including structural imaging techniques, functional imaging, non-invasive stimulation, and finally, awake craniotomy. We provide a rationale for combining these complementary techniques as part of a multimodal mapping paradigm to optimize postoperative language outcomes. Next, we review local and long-range adaptations that take place as the language network undergoes remodeling after tumor growth and surgical resection. We discuss the probable cellular mechanisms underlying this plasticity with emphasis on the white matter, which until recently was thought to have a limited role in adults. Finally, we provide an overview of emerging developments in targeting the glioma-neuronal network interface to achieve better disease control and promote recovery after injury.

N2  -  Objective: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the multiple sclerosis spinal cord is limited by low specificity regarding the underlying pathological processes, and new MRI metrics assessing microscopic damage are required. We aim to show for the first time that neurite orientation dispersion (i.e., variability in axon/dendrite orientations) is a new biomarker that uncovers previously undetected layers of complexity of multiple sclerosis spinal cord pathology. Also, we validate against histology a clinically viable MRI technique for dispersion measurement (neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, NODDI), to demonstrate the strong potential of the new marker. Methods: We related quantitative metrics from histology and MRI in four post mortem spinal cord specimens (two controls; two progressive multiple sclerosis cases). The samples were scanned at high field, obtaining maps of neurite density and orientation dispersion from NODDI and routine diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices. Histological procedures provided markers of astrocyte, microglia, myelin and neurofilament density, as well as neurite dispersion. Results: We report from both NODDI and histology a trend toward lower neurite dispersion in demyelinated lesions, indicative of reduced neurite architecture complexity. Also, we provide unequivocal evidence that NODDI-derived dispersion matches its histological counterpart (P < 0.001), while DTI metrics are less specific and influenced by several biophysical substrates. Interpretation: Neurite orientation dispersion detects a previously undescribed and potentially relevant layer of microstructural complexity of multiple sclerosis spinal cord pathology. Clinically feasible techniques such as NODDI may play a key role in clinical trial and practice settings, as they provide histologically meaningful dispersion indices.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preliminary data indicate that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may be useful in identifying and grading primary cerebral tumors. We tested the hypothesis that ADC values can be used to differentiate tumor, edema, and normal brain tissue.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with high-grade cerebral astrocytomas underwent conventional MR imaging, diffusion-weighted MR imaging, and proton MR spectroscopy. We defined tumor as an area containing the highest cholinecreatine and cholineN-actetyl aspartate ratios, contrast enhancement, and abnormal T2 signal intensity. Edema was defined as tissue with normal proton MR spectra, no enhancement, and high T2 signal intensity. Normal brain was assumed if tissue had normal proton MR spectra, no enhancement, and normal T2 signal intensity in the hemispheres ipsilateral or contralateral to tumor. ADC maps were calculated and regions of interest were manually placed over areas of tumor, edema, and normal tissue. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance. For post hoc testing, the Tukey method was used to correct for the effect of multiple comparisons, and significance was accepted if P was less than .05,; RESULTS:When ADC values were analyzed as a group, significant differences were found between tumor (131 + 45) and normal brain tissue (ipsilateral to tumor, 92 + 22; contralateral to tumor, 78 + 5) but not between tumor and adjacent edema (129 + 45). A plot of individual data points showed considerable overlapping among the three types of tissue sampled.; CONCLUSION: As a group, ADC values helped to distinguish high-grade glioma from normal tissue but could not be used to separate high-grade glioma from surrounding edema. Individually, ADC values overlapped considerably and were not useful in our patients. The utility of ADC values (as obtained in this relatively small study) is questionable in patients with high-grade cerebral astrocytomas.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-It is uncertain what determines the potential for cognitive recovery after ischemic stroke. The extent to which strategic areas of the brain network, so-called hubs, are affected by the infarct could be a key factor. We developed a lesion impact score, which estimates the damage to network hubs by integrating information on infarct size with healthy brain network topology. We verified whether the lesion impact score indeed reflects global network disturbances in patients and assessed if it could predict cognitive recovery.
Methods-Seventy-five ischemic stroke patients without signs of a prestroke cognitive disorder were included, all with evidence of a cognitive disorder during hospitalization. A brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessment were performed 5 weeks (1 week) after stroke. Neuropsychological testing was repeated after 1 year to assess cognitive recovery. Brain networks were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted data and consisted of 90 gray matter regions (ie, network nodes). A standard brain network map, indicating the hub-score of each node, was obtained from network data of 44 cognitively healthy adults. For each patient, we calculated the lesion impact score by multiplying the percentage of node volume affected by the infarct with the node's corresponding hub-score. The patients' maximum lesion impact score was used as outcome predictor.; Results-A higher lesion impact score in patients, indicating an increasing infarct size in nodes with a higher hub-score, was related to lower global brain network efficiency (beta=-0.528 -0.776 to -0.277; P<0.001), independent of age, brain volume, infarct volume, and white matter hyperintensity severity. A lower lesion impact score, however, was an independent predictor of cognitive recovery 1 year after stroke (odds ratio=0.434 0.193-0.978; P=0.044).; Conclusions-We introduced a lesion impact score that combines information on infarct size and network topology to predict long-term recovery after stroke. This score can potentially be used in a clinical setting, also without availability of high-resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.

N2  -  Objective According to the new World Health Organization 2016 classification for tumors of the central nervous system, 1p/19q codeletion defines the genetic hallmark that differentiates oligodendrogliomas from diffuse astrocytomas. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can stratify survival in adult patients with genetic defined diffuse glioma grades II and III.
Methods Sixty-seven patients with untreated diffuse gliomas World Health Organization grades II and III and known 1p19q codeletion status were included retrospectively and analyzed using ADC and rCBV maps based on whole-tumor volume histograms. Overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analyses adjusted for known survival predictors.; Results Significant longer PFS was associated with homogeneous rCBV distribution-higher rCBV(peak) (median, 37 vs 26 months; hazard ratio HR, 3.2; P = 0.02) in patients with astrocytomas, and heterogeneous rCBV distribution-lower rCBV(peak) (median, 46 vs 37 months; HR, 5.3; P < 0.001) and higher rCBV(mean) (median, 44 vs 39 months; HR, 7.9; P = 0.003) in patients with oligodendrogliomas. Apparent diffusion coefficient parameters (ADC(peak), ADC(mean)) did not stratify PFS and overall survival.; Conclusions Tumors with heterogeneous perfusion signatures and high average values were associated with longer PFS in patients with oligodendrogliomas. On the contrary, heterogeneous perfusion distribution was associated with poor outcome in patients with diffuse astrocytomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The middle frontal gyrus (MFG) is involved in attention, working memory, and language-related processing. A detailed understanding of the subcortical white matter tracts connected within the MFG can facilitate improved navigation of white matter lesions in and around this gyrus and explain the postoperative morbidity after surgery. We aimed to characterize the fiber tracts within the MFG according to their connection to neuroanatomic structures through the use of diffusion spectrum imaging-based fiber tractography and validate the findings by gross anatomic dissection for qualitative visual agreement.
METHODS: Tractography analysis was completed using diffusion imaging data from 10 healthy, adult subjects enrolled in the Human Connectome Project. We assessed the MFG as a whole component according to its fiber connectivity with other neural regions. Mapping was completed on all tracts within both hemispheres, with the resultant tract volumes used to calculate a lateralization index. A modified Klingler technique was used on 10 postmortem dissections to demonstrate the location and orientation of the major tracts.; RESULTS: Two major connections of the MFG were identified: the superior longitudinal fasciculus, which connects the MFG to parts of the inferior parietal lobule, posterior temporal lobe, and lateral occipital cortex; and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, which connected the MFG to the lingual gyrus and cuneus. Intra- and intergyral short association, U-shaped fibers were also identified.; CONCLUSIONS: Subcortical white matter pathways integrated within the MFG include the superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. The MFG is implicated in a variety of tasks involving attention and memory, making it an important cortical region. The postoperative neurologic outcomes related to surgery in and around the MFG could be clarified in the context of the anatomy of the fiber bundles highlighted in the present study.

N2  -  Purpose: Recent publications have reported contradictory results of pretreatment diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the prediction of chemoradiotherapeutic response in primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of DWI obtained with both standard (b = 0 and 1,000 s/mm(2)) and high (b = 0 and 2,000 s/mm(2)) b-values for predicting response to induction chemotherapy in HNSCCs.
Methods: For 25 patients with primary HNSCC who underwent DWI with both standard and high b-values prior to treatment, we calculated corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Regions of interest containing the tumor were drawn on every section of ADC maps and summated to make volume-based data of the entire tumor. Histogram parameters (mean ADC, kurtosis, and skewness) were correlated with treatment response using unpaired Student t test. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the ADC parameters, patient age, sex, whole tumor volume, and T stage were also performed to predict tumor response to induction chemotherapy.; Results: Response to induction chemotherapy was good in 13 of the 25 patients and poor in 12. The mean ADC values of good responders at standard b-value (ADC(1000)), 1.23 +- 0.34 (x 10(-3)mm(2)s), and high b-value (ADC(2000)), 0.62 +- 0.14 (x 10(-3)mm(2)s), were lower than those of poor responders (ADC(1000), 1.32 +- 0.28 x 10(-3)mm(2)s; ADC(2000), 0.76 0.15 x 10(-3)mm(2)s), but significant difference was achieved only at the ADC(2000) map (P = 0.02). In addition, mean tumor volume prior to treatment of good responders was smaller than that of poor responders. However, at multiple logistic regression analysis, only the mean ADC(2000) value remained as a significant predictor of response to induction chemotherapy.; Conclusion: DWI with high b-values (b = 0 and 2,000 smm(2)) as an assessment of ADC values may help predict tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary HNSCCs

N2  -  Background: Identifying tissue at risk for infarction is important in deciding which patients would benefit most from potentially harmful therapies and provides a way to evaluate newer therapies with regard to the amount of ischemic tissue salvaged. Objective: To operationally define and characterize cerebral tissue at risk for stroke progression. Methods: We retrospectively selected 25 patients with an acute onset of a hemispheric stroke from our database who had undergone a combination of two diffusion-weighted MRI studies and a perfusion-weighted MRI study. We applied a logistic regression model using maps of the relative mean transit time and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as well as three different maps of the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) to predict an operationally defined penumbra (region of mismatch between the diffusion lesion on day 1 and its extension 24 to 72 hours later). Results: Maps of the rCBF and initial rCBV were significant predictors for identifying penumbral tissue. Our operationally defined penumbral region was characterized by a reduction in the initial rCBV (47% of contralateral control region [CCR]), an increase (163% of CCR) in the total rCBV, and a reduction (37% of CCR) in the rCBF, whereas the operationally defined ischemic core showed a more severe reduction in the rCBF (12% of CCR) and in the initial rCBV (19% of CCR). Conclusion: These MR indexes may allow the identification and quantification of viable but ischemically threatened cerebral tissue amenable to therapeutic interventions in the hyperacute care of stroke patients.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Brain retraction systems are frequently required to achieve surgical exposure of deep-seated brain lesions. Spatula-based systems can be associated with injury to the cortex and deep white matter, particularly adjacent to the sharp edges, which can result in uneven pressure on the parenchyma over the course of a long operation. The use of tubular retractor systems has been proposed as a method to overcome these limitations. There have been no studies assessing the degree of brain injury associated with the use of tubular retractors.
METHODS Twenty patients were retrospectively identified at Weill Cornell Medical College who underwent resection of deep-seated brain lesions between 2005 and 2014 with the aid of a METRx tubular retractor system. Using the Brainlab software, pre- and postoperative images were analyzed to assess volume, depth, extent of resection, and change in postoperative MR FLAIR hyperintensity and restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).; RESULTS The mean preoperative tumor volume was 16.25 +- 17.6 cm(3). Gross-total resection was achieved in 75%, near-total resection in 10%, and subtotal resection in 15% of patients. There was a small but not statistically significant increase in average FLAIR hyperintensity volume by 3.25 +- 10.51 cm(3) (p = 0.16). The average postoperative volume of DWI high signal area with restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient maps was 8.35 3.05 cm3. Assuming that the volume of restricted diffusion on DWI around tumor was 0 preoperatively, this represented a statistically significant increase on DWI (p < 0.001).; CONCLUSIONS Although tubular retractors do not appear to significantly increase FLAIR signal in the brain, DWI intensity around the retractors can be identified. These data indicate that although tubular retractors may minimize damage to surrounding tissues, they still cause cytotoxic edema and cellular damage. Objective comparison against other retraction methods, as compared by 3D volumetric analysis or similar methods, will be important in determining the true advantage of tubular retractor systems.

N2  -  Objective: Approximately 97% of the right-handers has left hemisphere language dominance. Within the language dominant hemisphere Broca's area is of crucial importance for a variety of linguistic functions. As a result, tumour resection in and around Broca's area is controversial. However, studies showed that by means of Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) tumour resection in this region can be safely performed. We report unexpected anatomoclinical findings in a right-handed patient who underwent tumour resection in the left prefrontal lobe.
Methods: Language functions in this right-handed patient were extensively examined in the pre-, intra, and postoperative phase by means of a standardised battery of neurolinguistic and neurocognitive tests. Results obtained in the pre- and postoperative phase are compared. In addition, intraoperative DES findings and postoperative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) results are reported.; Results: Tumour resection near Broca's area was safely performed since no positive language sites were found during intraoperative DES. Since no linguistic deficits occurred in the pre-, intra-, or postoperative phase, atypical language dominance was suspected. Neuropsychological investigations, however, disclosed permanent executive dysfunction. Postoperative fMRI and DTI confirmed right cerebral language dominance as well as a crossed cerebro-cerebellar functional link with the left cerebellar hemisphere.; Discussion: Atypical right hemisphere language dominance in this right-handed patient is reflected by: (1) the total absence of language problems in the pre-, intra- and postoperative phase, (2) absence of positive stimulation sites during DES, (3) a clearly more pronounced arcuate fasciculus in the right cerebral hemisphere (DTI), (4) a crossed functional connection between the right cerebrum and the left cerebellum (fMRI). Two hypothetical explanations for the pattern of crossed cerebral language dominance are put forward: (1) preoperative brain plasticity mechanisms inducing a shift of language functions to the right hemisphere or (2) right hemisphere language dominance as a maturational variant. This case with atypical cerebral language dominance shows that although DES is the 'gold standard' to identify eloquent language regions and their pathways, fMRI and DTI are important adjuncts to guide surgery, to identify language lateralisation and to study anatomoclinical correlations.

N2  -  Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%)had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.

N2  -  Functional neuronavigation allows intraoperative visualization of cortical eloquent brain areas. Major white matter tracts, such as the pyramidal tract, can be delineated by diffusion-tensor-imaging based fiber tracking. These tractography data were integrated into 3-D datasets applied for neuronavigation by rigid registration of the diffusion images with standard anatomical image data so that their course could be superimposed onto the surgical field during resection of gliomas. Intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging was used to compensate for the effects of brain shift, which amounted up to 8 mm. Despite image distortion of echo planar images, which was identified by non-linear registration techniques, navigation was reliable. In none of the 19 patients new postoperative neurological deficits were encountered. Intraoperative visualization of major white matter tracts allows save resection of gliomas near eloquent brain areas. A possible shifting of the pyramidal tract has to be taken into account after major tumor parts are resected. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  To investigate a possible relationship between the severity of pathological and radiological lesions in diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) we compared DWI findings from 6 sequential brain MRI scans with pathological features of numerous tissue blocks of different cortical and subcortical regions in a case of autopsy-proven sporadic CJD. Whereas DWI and pathological examination revealed multifocal, cortical and deep hyperintensities at corresponding localizations, no correlation between the degree of severity of radiologically visible and pathological damage was found.
The characteristic focal involvement and extension of lesions of the cortex and the basal ganglia bilaterally shown by DWI may be an argument for the spreading of the disease per contiguitatem.

N2  -  The aim of the study is to verify the effect of hyperglycemia on ischemia-reperfusion injury and to explore the feasibility of noninvasive observation of ischemic-reperfusion injury in hyperglycemic ischemic stroke by MRI technique. According to the duration of ischemia and blood glucose levels, 40 rats were divided into hyperglycemic ischemic 2-hr (H-I2h), hyperglycemic ischemic 6-hr (H-I6h), non-hyperglycemic ischemic 2-hr (NH-I2h), and non-hyperglycemic ischemic 6-hr (NH-I6h) groups. T2W imaging, DW imaging, T2 mapping, T2* mapping, DCE, and T1 mapping after enhancement sequences were acquired before reperfusion and approximately 3-hr after reperfusion. ADC, T1, T2, T2*, and K-trans values of ischemic lesion were obtained in different groups. After reperfusion, the variation of ADC values showed no significant difference between groups with diabetes and groups without diabetes and between different recanalization time-points (2-hr vs 6-hr). After reperfusion, T2, T2*, and Ktrans values increased in different degrees in all four groups. Only the T1 value decreased in all groups. The change of all parameters in groups with hyperglycemia was more obvious than that in groups without hyperglycemia and was more obvious in groups with H-I6h versus those with H-I2h. This study confirms that hyperglycemia aggravates ischemia-reperfusion injury and may be an important risk factor for the prognosis of ischemic stroke. The Ktrans values should be noninvasive imaging indicators to monitor blood brain barrier permeability and ischemic-reperfusion injury in ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. The purpose of this study was to prospectively validate usefulness of diffusion-tensor (DT) fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract at 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, in combination with the subcortical motor-evoked potential (MEP) technique, as a tool for tractography-guided neurosurgery. DT imaging and corticospinal tractography were performed at 3 T in eight patients (four men, four women; mean age, 41 years; age range, 23-58 years) with intracranial space-occupying lesions. Tractography data were transferred to a neuronavigation system, and tractography-guided neurosurgery was performed. During lesion resection, subcortical MEPs were recorded. Positive MEP response was observed in four patients. No patients developed new motor weakness postoperatively. Complementary use of tractography and MEP may be useful for intraoperative depiction of corticospinal tracts.

N2  -  Background-The association between the location and the mechanism of a stroke lesion remains unclear. A diffusion-weighted imaging study may help resolve this lack of clarity.
Methods and Results-We studied a consecutive series of 2702 acute ischemic stroke patients whose stroke lesions were confirmed by diffusion-weighted imaging and who underwent a thorough etiological investigation. The vascular territory in which an ischemic lesion was situated was identified using standard anatomic maps of the dominant arterial territories. Stroke subtype was based on the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, or TOAST, classification. Large-artery atherosclerosis (37.3%) was the most common stroke subtype, and middle cerebral artery (49.6%) was the most frequently involved territory. Large-artery atherosclerosis was the most common subtype for anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, vertebral, and anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory infarctions. Small vessel occlusion was the leading subtype in basilar and posterior cerebral artery territories. Cardioembolism was the leading cause in superior cerebellar artery territory. Compared with carotid territory stroke, vertebrobasilar territory stroke was more likely to be caused by small vessel occlusion (21.4% versus 30.1%, P < 0.001) and less likely to be caused by cardioembolism (23.2% versus 13.8%, P < 0.001). Multiple-vascular-territory infarction was frequently caused by cardioembolism (44.2%) in carotid territory and by large-artery atherosclerosis (52.1%) in vertebrobasilar territory.; Conclusions-Information on vascular territory of a stroke lesion may be helpful in timely investigation and accurate diagnosis of stroke etiology.

N2  -  Brainstein epidermoid cysts are rare lesions, with only 18 reported cases in the literature and only five purely intrinsic epidermoid cysts within this group. The authors present the case of a 3-year-old girl with a history of chronic headaches, progressive diplopia, and relapsing and remitting mild right hemiparesis who was found to harbor an intrinsic brainstem epidermoid cyst at the pontomedullary junction. Initial working diagnoses included intrinsic brainstem astrocytoma and cavernoma. After tumor enlargement and progressive symptoms, a diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence was performed and a definitive diagnosis of an intrinsic brainstem epidermoid cyst was made in the patient. The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and complete resection of the cyst with the aid of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Three years after the operation, the patient is neurologically intact and no evidence of tumor recurrence has been found. The rarity of brainstem epidermoid cysts can make their diagnosis difficult: thus a DW MR imaging sequence of the brain is a useful diagnostic modality. Intrinsic brainstem epidermoid cysts can be removed safely, in a manner similar to that used for the surgical treatment of focal tumors.

Primary brain tumors are composed of tumor cells, neuralglial tissues, edema, and vasculature tissue. Conventional MRI has a limited ability to evaluate heterogeneous tumor pathologies. We developed a novel diffusion MRI-based method-Heterogeneity Diffusion Imaging (HDI)-to simultaneously detect and characterize multiple tumor pathologies and capillary blood perfusion using a single diffusion MRI scan.; Methods; Seven adult patients with primary brain tumors underwent standard-of-care MRI protocols and HDI protocol before planned surgical resection andor stereotactic biopsy. Twelve tumor sampling sites were identified using a neuronavigational system and recorded for imaging data quantification. Metrics from both protocols were compared between World Health Organization (WHO) II and III tumor groups. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) derived from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging was also compared with the HDI-derived perfusion fraction.; Results; The conventional apparent diffusion coefficient did not identify differences between WHO II and III tumor groups. HDI-derived slow hindered diffusion fraction was significantly elevated in the WHO III group as compared with the WHO II group. There was a non-significantly increasing trend of HDI-derived tumor cellularity fraction in the WHO III group, and both HDI-derived perfusion fraction and DSC-derived CBV were found to be significantly higher in the WHO III group. Both HDI-derived perfusion fraction and slow hindered diffusion fraction strongly correlated with DSC-derived CBV. Neither HDI-derived cellularity fraction nor HDI-derived fast hindered diffusion fraction correlated with DSC-derived CBV.; Conclusions; Conventional apparent diffusion coefficient, which measures averaged pathology properties of brain tumors, has compromised accuracy and specificity. HDI holds great promise to accurately separate and quantify the tumor cell fraction, the tumor cell packing density, edema, and capillary blood perfusion, thereby leading to an improved microenvironment characterization of primary brain tumors. Larger studies will further establish HDI's clinical value and use for facilitating biopsy planning, treatment evaluation, and noninvasive tumor grading.

N2  -  To investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of cerebral infarction (CI) in patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
CI is a well-known complication of SAH that is typically detected on computed tomography (CT). MRI has improved sensitivity for acute CI over CT, particularly with multiple, small, or asymptomatic lesions.; With IRB approval, 400 consecutive SAH patients admitted to our institution from August 2006 to March 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Traumatic SAH and secondary SAH were excluded. Data were collected on demographics, cause of SAH, Hunt Hess and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades, and neuroimaging results. MRIs were categorized by CI pattern as single cortical (SC), single deep (SD), multiple cortical (MC), multiple deep (MD), and multiple cortical and deep (MCD).; Among 123 (30.8 %) SAH patients who underwent MRIs during their hospitalization, 64 (52 %) demonstrated acute CI. The mean time from hospital admission to MRI was 5.7 days (range 0-29 days). Among the 64 patients with MRI infarcts, MRI CI pattern was as follows: MC in 20 (31 %), MCD in 18 (28 %), SC in 16 (25 %), SD in 3 (5 %), MD in 2 (3 %), and 5 (8 %) did not have images available for review. Most infarcts detected on MRI (3964 or 61 %) were not visible on CT.; The use of MRI increases the detection of CI in SAH. Unlike CT studies, MRI-detected CI in SAH tends to involve multiple vascular territories. Studies that rely on CT may underestimate the burden of CI after SAH.

N2  -  Objective
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently detected after ischemic stroke for the first time, and brain regions involved in autonomic control have been suspected to trigger AF. We examined whether specific brain regions are associated with newly detected AF after ischemic stroke.; Methods; Patients with acute cerebral infarctions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were included in this lesion mapping study. Lesions were mapped and modeled voxelwise using Bayesian Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Modeling to determine differences in infarct locations between stroke patients with new AF, without AF and with AF already known before the stroke.; Results; 582 patients were included (median age 68 years; 63.2% male). AF was present in 109582 patients (18.7%); new AF: 39109 (35.8%), known AF: 70109 (64.2%). AF patients had larger infarct volumes than patients without AF (mean: 29.7 +- 45.8 ml vs. 15.2 +- 35.1 ml; p<0.001). Lesions in AF patients accumulated in the right central middle cerebral artery territory. Increasing stroke size predicted progressive cortical but not pontine and thalamic involvement. Patients with new AF had more frequently lesions in the right insula compared to patients without AF when stroke size was not accounted for, but no specific brain region was more frequently involved after adjustment for infarct volume. Controlled for stroke size, left parietal involvement was less likely for patients with new AF than for those without AF or with known AF.; Conclusions; In the search for brain areas potentially triggering cardiac arrhythmias infarct size should be accounted for. After controlling for infarct size, there is currently no evidence that ischemic stroke lesions of specific brain areas are associated with new AF compared to patients without AF. This challenges the neurogenic hypothesis of AF according to which a relevant proportion of new AF is triggered by ischemic brain lesions of particular locations.

N2  -  Purpose Perfusion MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents is useful for diagnosis and treatment response evaluation of brain tumors. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors. Methods One hundred nine brain-tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared. Results Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (rho = 0.87,P< .05 and rho = 0.86,P< .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (rho = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.47. Conclusion Realistic rCBV maps can be synthesized from DCE MRI and contain quantitative information, enabling robust brain-tumor perfusion imaging of DSC and DCE parameters with a single gadolinium-based contrast agent administration.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To present applications of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in studies of neurosurgical patients.
METHODS: MEG maps magnetic fields generated by electric currents in the brain, and allows the localization of brain areas producing evoked sensory responses and spontaneous electromagnetic activity. The identified sources can be integrated with other imaging modalities, e.g., with magnetic resonance imaging scans of individual patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy, or with other types of brain imaging data.; RESULTS: MEG measurements using modern whole-scalp instruments assist in tailoring individual therapies for neurosurgical patients by producing maps of functionally irretrievable cortical areas and by identifying cortical sources of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity. The excellent time resolution of MEG enables tracking of complex spaciotemporal source patterns, helping, for example, with the separation of the epileptic pacemaker from propagated activity. The combination of noninvasive mapping of subcortical pathways by magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging with MEG source localization will, in the near future, provide even more accurate navigational tools for preoperative planning. Other possible future applications of MEG include the noninvasive estimation of language lateralization and the follow-up of brain plasticity elicited by central or peripheral neural lesions or during the treatment of chronic pain.; CONCLUSION: MEG is a mature technique suitable for producing preoperative "road maps" of eloquent cortical areas and for localizing epileptiform activity.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively investigate whether quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) parameters, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and MR spectroscopic metabolite concentrations, allow for discrimination between different types of pathologic conditions that underlie signal intensity abnormalities in white matter.
Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Forty-one patients (19 male, 22 female; mean age, 15.4 years) and 41 control subjects (25 male, 16 female; mean age, 11.3 years) were included. Twelve patients had a hypomyelinating disorder; 14, a demyelinating disorder; five, a disorder characterized by myelin vacuolation; and 10, a disorder characterized by cystic degeneration. Regions of interest were selected within the parietal white matter and were transferred to the corresponding sections of the generated ADC, FA, and MTR maps to extract quantitative measurements. Linear discriminant analysis and univariate analysis of covariance were used for statistical evaluation.; Results: Linear discriminant analysis showed that 95% of patients were correctly classified by using total creatine, cholinecontaining compounds, myo-inositol, MTR, and ADC. In the hypomyelination group, all MR parameters were close to normal, with the exception of elevated total creatine (P <.03) and myo-inositol (P <.001) levels and decreased MTR values (P <.001). In the demyelination group, the levels of choline-containing compounds (P <.02) and myoinositol (P <.001) were highly elevated. In the myelin vacuolation and cystic degeneration groups, high ADC values (P <.001) and variable decreases in all MR spectroscopic metabolites were seen. MTR was significantly reduced (P <.001) in the cystic degeneration group.; Conclusion: Quantitative MR techniques can be used to discriminate between different types of white matter disorders and to classify white matter lesions of unknown origin with respect to underlying pathologic conditions.

N2  -  Purpose Stroke is one of the most prevalent vascular diseases. Non-invasive molecular imaging methods have the potential to provide critical insights into the temporal dynamics and follow alterations of receptor expression and metabolism in ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to assess the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) levels in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse models at subacute stage using positron emission tomography (PET) with our novel tracer [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 and structural imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Procedures Our recently developed CB2R PET tracer [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 was used for imaging neuroinflammation at 24 h after reperfusion in tMCAO mice. The RNA expression levels of CB2R and other inflammatory markers were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using brain tissues from tMCAO (1 h occlusion) and sham-operated mice. [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was included for evaluation of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc). In addition, diffusion-weighted imaging and T-2-weighted imaging were performed for anatomical reference and delineating the lesion in tMCAO mice. Results mRNA expressions of inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, Iba1, MMP9 and GFAP, CNR2 were increased to 1.3-2.5 fold at 24 h after reperfusion in the ipsilateral compared to contralateral hemisphere of tMCAO mice, while mRNA expression of the neuronal marker MAP-2 was markedly reduced to ca. 50 %. Reduced [F-18]FDG uptake was observed in the ischemic striatum of tMCAO mouse brain at 24 h after reperfusion. Although higher activity of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 in ex vivo biodistribution studies and higher standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) were detected in the ischemic ipsilateral compared to contralateral striatum in tMCAO mice, the in vivo specificity of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 was confirmed only in the CB2R-rich spleen. Conclusions This study revealed an increased [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 measure of CB2R and a reduced [F-18]FDG measure of CMRglc in the ischemic striatum of tMCAO mice at subacute stage. [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 might be a promising PET tracer for detecting CB2R alterations in animal models of neuroinflammation without neuronal loss.

N2  -  Oxygen metabolism is altered in brain tumor regions and is quantified by the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). Direct dynamic O-17 MRI with inhalation of isotopically enriched O-17(2) gas can be used to quantify CMRO2; however, pixel-wise CMRO2 quantification in human brain is challenging due to low natural abundance of O-17 isotope and, thus, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of O-17 MR images. To test the feasibility CMRO2 mapping at a clinical 3 T MRI system, a new iterative reconstruction was proposed, which uses the edge information contained in a co-registered H-1 gradient image to construct a non-homogeneous anisotropic diffusion (AD) filter. AD-constrained reconstruction of O-17 MR images was compared to conventional Kaiser-Bessel gridding without and with Hanning filtering, and to iterative reconstruction with a total variation (TV) constraint. For numerical brain phantom and in two in vivo data sets of one healthy volunteer, AD-constrained reconstruction provided O-17 images with improved resolution of fine brain structures and resulted in higher SNR. CMRO2 values of 0.78 - 1.55 mu mol/g(tissue)/min (white brain matter) and 1.03 - 2.01 mu mol/g(tissue)/min (gray brain matter) as well as the CMRO2 maps are in a good agreement with the results of O-15-PET and O-17 MRI at 7 T and at 9.4 T. In conclusion, the proposed AD-constrained reconstruction enabled calculation of 3D CMRO2 maps at 3 T MRI system, which is an essential step towards clinical translation of O-17 MRI for non-invasive CMRO2 quantification in tumor patients.

N2  -  Background: Gliomas are among the most challenging pathologies for neurosurgeons due to their infiltrative and recurrent nature in functionally relevant regions. Current knowledge confirms that gross total resection highly influence survival in patient with glioma. However, surgery performed in eloquent brain area, could seriously compromise the quality of life in patient with reduced life expectancy even more if it concerns the language function. Methods: 18 right-handed patients with perisylvian gliomas on the left hemisphere were prospectively analyzed over a period of 12 months. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging based tractography of the five main language Tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus, Frontal Aslant Tract, Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, Uncinate Fasciculus) was navigated during the surgical procedure. Using a validated method, correlations were made between the pre-operative fascicles and their possible infiltration and surgical damage. The language status was assessed using the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results: In all nine patients who developed a permanent disorder there was pre-operative involvement of at least one fascicle and resection of at least one of these. In this way, areas of high risk of permanent language damage have emerged as a result of surgical injury: the temporoparietal junction, the middle portion of the FAT and the temporal stem. Conclusions: Navigated tractography has proven to be a user-friendly tool that can assess perioperative risk, guide surgical resection, and help the neurosurgeon to find that balance between tumor resection and function preservation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas are the 2 of the most common brain neoplasms in adults. However, distinguishing solitary metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas on conventional magnetic resonance imaging remains particularly challenging. Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (CE-FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing between metastatic brain tumors and glioblastomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with metastatic brain tumors and 14 patients with glioblastomas underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and CE-FIESTA before surgery. First, 1 neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon classified the CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma by consensus. Next, the 2 neuroradiologists performed an observer performance study comparing tumor shape classification (smooth or irregular margins), a classic imaging finding, with the CE-FIESTA classification of the peritumoral brain parenchyma.; RESULTS: The CE-FIESTA findings for the peritumoral brain parenchyma were classified as follows: type A, no hyperintense rim; type B, partial hyperintense rim; and type C, extended hyperintense rim. With regard to the diagnosis of metastatic brain tumors, the observer performance study demonstrated that the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of an extended hyperintense rim classification (type C) on CE-FIESTA images were 95.3%, 85.7%, and 93.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the CE-FIESTA classification was significantly higher than that of the tumor shape classification.; CONCLUSIONS: CE-FIESTA images may provide useful information for distinguishing metastatic brain tumors from glioblastomas, especially when focusing on differences in the peritumoral brain parenchyma.

N2  -  Background The multiple prominent hypointense veins on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) have been found in the ischemic territory of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Venous side is the unknown area in the hemodynamics of brain infarction.
Purpose To evaluate the venous aspect in acute brain infarction through an animal study.; Material and Methods The acute infarction in cat brains was induced with a bolus infusion of 0.25mL of triolein through one side of the common carotid artery. The magnetic resonance (MR) images, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, SW, and perfusion-weighted (PWI) images, were obtained serially at 2h (n=17), 1 day (n=11), and 4 days (n=4) after triolein infusion. The obtained MR images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. For qualitative assessment, the signal intensity of the serial MR images was evaluated. The presence or absence and the location with serial changes of infarction were identified on DWI and ADC map images. The presence or absence of prominent hypointense veins and the serial changes of cortical veins were also evaluated on SWI. Quantitative assessment was performed by comparing the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and mean transit times (MTT) of the lesions with those of the contralateral normal side calculated on PWI. The serial changes of rCBV, rCBF, and MTT ratio were also evaluated.; Results Acute infarction in the first and second medial gyrus of lesion hemisphere was found by qualitative evaluation of DWI and ADC map images. On the serial evaluation of SWI, the cortical veins of cat brain with infarction were obscured at 2h and then re-appeared at 1 day. The hemorrhage transformation and prominent hypointense veins were seen at 4 days on SWI. The quantitative evaluation revealed increased MTT ratios and decreased rCBV and rCBF ratios on PWIs in the acute infarction of cat brain.; Conclusion The prominent hypointense veins on SWI were seen in the half of the acute infarction at 4 days. The prominent hypointense veins on SWI may have good agreement with the increased MTT ratio.

N2  -  Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) could have clinical application in the delivery of neuroprotective agents following ischemic stroke. However, ischemic brain tissue changes such as cytotoxic edema, in which cellular swelling decreases the fractional volume of the extracellular space, would be expected to significantly alter the distribution of neuroprotective agents delivered by CED. We sought to predict and characterize these effects using the magnetic resonance contrast agent gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) as a model therapeutic agent. CED was observed using MRI in a normal rat brain and in amiddle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion rat model of brain ischemia. Gd-DTPA was infused to the caudate putamen in the normal rat (n = 6) and MCA occlusion model (n = 6). In each rat, baseline apparent diffusion coefficient images were acquired prior to infusion, and T1 maps were then acquired 13 times throughout the duration of the experiment. These T1 maps were used to computeGd-DTPAconcentrations throughout each brain. In the MCA occlusion group, CED delivered Gd-DTPA to a comparatively larger volume with lower average tissue concentrations. Following the infusion, the total content of Gd-DTPA decreased more slowly in the MCA occlusion group than in the normal group. This quantitative characterization confirms that edematous ischemic tissue changes alter the distribution of agents by CED. These findings may have important implications for CED in the treatment of brain injury, and will assist in future efforts to model the distribution of therapeutic agents.

N2  -  F-19 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-c-glucose (FDG) and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyo-glucose-6-phosphate (FDG-6P) can be used for directly assessing total glucose metabolism in vivo. To date, F-19 MRS measurements of FDG phosphorylation in the brain have either been achieved ex vivo from extracted tissue or in vivo by unusually long acquisition times. Electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements indicate that FDG doses up to 500 mg,/kg can be tolerated with minimal side effects on cerebral physiology and evoked IMRI-BOLD responses to forepaw stimulation. In halothane-anesthetized rats, we report localized in vivo detection and separation of FDG and FDG-6P MRS signals with F-19 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) at 11.7 T. A metabolic model based on reversible transport between plasma and brain tissue, which included a non-saturable plasma to tissue component was used to calculate spatial distribution of FOG and FDG-6P concentrations in rat brain. In addition, spatial distribution of rate constants and metabolic fluxes of FOG to FDG-6P conversion conversion were estimated. Mapping the rate of FOG to FDG-6P conversion by F-19 CSI provides an MR methodology that could impact other in vivo applications such as characterization of tumor pathophysiology.

N2  -  Objective To compare 11C-methionine (11C-METH) PET with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in patients with glioma candidate to neurosurgery. Methods We collected and analyzed data from 124 consecutive patients (n= 124) investigated during preoperative work-up. Both visual and semiquantitative parameters were utilized for image analysis. The reference standard was based on histopathology. The median follow-up was 14.3 months. Results Overall, 47 high-grade gliomas (HGG) and 77 low-grade gliomas (LGG) were diagnosed. On visual assessment, sensitivity and specificity for differentiating HGG from LGG were 80.8 and 59.7% for DWI-MRI, versus 95.7 and 41.5% for 11C-METH PET, respectively. On semiquantitative analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 78.7, 71.4, and 80.4% for SUVmax, 78.7, 70.1, and 81.1% for SUVratio, and 74.5, 61, and 76.7% for MTB (metabolic tumor burden), respectively. In patients with negative DWI-MRI and IDH-wild type, SUVmax and SUVratio were higher compared to IDH-mutated (P= 0.025 andP= 0.01, respectively). In LGG, patients with 1p/19q codeletion showed higher SUVmax (P= 0.044). In all patients with negative DWI-MRI, median PFS was longer for SUVmax <3.9 (median not reached vs 34.2 months,P= 0.004), SUVratio <2.3 (median not reached vs 21.5 months,P< 0.001), and MTB <3.1 (median not reached vs 45.7 months,P= 0.05). In LGG patients with negative DWI-MRI, only SUVratio <2.3 and MTB <3.1 were associated with longer PFS (P= 0.016 andP= 0.024, respectively). Conclusion: C-METH PET was found highly sensitive for glioma differentiation and molecular characterization. In DWI-negative patients, PET parameters correlated with molecular profile were associated with clinical outcome.

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common immune-mediated disabling neurological disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of MS is not fully understood. Histopathology implicates both demyelination and axonal degeneration as the major contributors to the accumulation of disability. The application of several in vivo quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to both lesioned and normal-appearing brain tissue has not yet provided a solid conclusive support of the hypothesis that MS might be a diffuse disease.
In this work, we adopted FreeSurfer to provide standardized macrostructure or volumetry of lesion free normal-appearing brain tissue in combination with multiple quantitative MRI metrics (T-2 relaxation time, diffusion tensor anisotropy and diffusivities) that characterize tissue microstructural integrity. By incorporating a large number of healthy controls, we have attempted to separate the natural age-related change from the disease-induced effects. Our work shows elevation in diffusivity and relaxation times and reduction in volume in a number of normal-appearing white matter and gray matter structures in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. These changes were related in part with the spatial distribution of lesions. The whole brain lesion load and age-adjusted expanded disability status score showed strongest correlations in regions such as corpus callosum with qMRI metrics that are believed to be specific markers of axonal dysfunction, consistent with histologic data of others indicating axonal loss that is independent of focal lesions. Our results support that MS at least in part has a neurodegenerative component. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the image quality and feasibility of a field map-based technique to correct for susceptibility-induced geometric distortions which are typical for diffusion EPI brain imaging.
Methods We prospectively included 52 patients during clinical routine in this single-center study. All scans were performed on a 3T MRI. Patients' indications for MRI mainly consisted of suspected stroke due to the clinical presentation. For the morphological comparison of the corrected and uncorrected EPI diffusion, three experienced radiologists assessed the image quality of the sequences in a blinded and randomized fashion using a Likert scale (1 being poor; 5 being excellent). To ensure comparability of the two methods, an additional quantitative analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was performed.; Results Corrected EPI diffusion was rated significantly superior in all the selected categories: overall level of artifacts (p < 0.001), degree of distortion at the frontal, temporal, occipital and brainstem levels (p < 0.001), conspicuousness of ischemic lesions (p < 0.001), image quality (p < 0.001), naturality (p < 0.001), contrast (p < 0.001), and diagnostic confidence (p < 0.001).; Conclusion Corrected EPI diffusion offers a significant reduction of geometric distortion in all evaluated brain regions and an improved conspicuousness of ischemic lesions. Image quality, overall artifacts, naturality, contrast and diagnostic confidence were also rated superior in comparison to uncorrected EPI diffusion.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the only noninvasive method for mapping white matter connections in the brain. We describe SlicerDMRI, a software suite that enables visualization and analysis of dMRI for neuroscientific studies and patient-specific anatomic assessment. SlicerDMRI has been successfully applied in multiple studies of the human brain in health and disease, and here, we especially focus on its cancer research applications. As an extension module of the 3D Slicer medical image computing platform, the SlicerDMRI suite enables dMRI analysis in a clinically relevant multimodal imaging workflow. Core SlicerDMRI functionality includes diffusion tensor estimation, white matter tractography with single and multi-fiber models, and dMRI quantification. SlicerDMRI supports clinical DICOM and research file formats, is open-source and crossplatform, and can be installed as an extension to 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org). More information, videos, tutorials, and sample data are available at dmri. slicer. org. (C) 2017 AACR.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to compare the diffusion characteristic of lactate and alanine in a brain tumor model to that of normal brain metabolites known to be mainly intracellular such as N-acetylaspartate or creatine. The diffusion of C-13-labeled metabolites was measured in vivo with localized NMR spectroscopy at 9.4 T (400 MHz) using a previously described localization and editing pulse sequence known as ACED-STEAM ('adiabatic carbon editing and decoupling'). C-13-labeled glucose was administered and the apparent diffusion coefficients of the glycolytic products, {H-1-C-13}-lactate and {H-1-C-13}-alanine, were determined in rat intracerebral 9L glioma. To obtain insights into {H-1-C-13}-lactate compartmentation (intra-versus extracellular), the pulse sequence used very large diffusion weighting (50 ms/mu m(2)). Multi-exponential diffusion attenuation of the lactate metabolite signals was observed. The persistence of a lactate signal at very large diffusion weighting provided direct experimental evidence of significant intracellular lactate concentration. To investigate the spatial distribution of lactate and other metabolites, H-1 spectroscopic images were also acquired. Lactate and choline-containing compounds were consistently elevated in tumor tissue, but not in necrotic regions and surrounding normal-appearing brain. Overall, these findings suggest that lactate is mainly associated with tumor tissue and that within the time-frame of these experiments at least some of the glycolytic product ([C-13] lactate) originates from an intracellular compartment.

N2  -  ObjectivesTo evaluate the performance of multiparametric neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics in distinguishing between glioblastoma (Gb) and solitary brain metastasis (SBM).Materials and methodsIn this retrospective study, NODDI images were curated from 109 patients with Gb (n = 57) or SBM (n = 52). Automatically segmented multiple volumes of interest (VOIs) encompassed the main tumor regions, including necrosis, solid tumor, and peritumoral edema. Radiomics features were extracted for each main tumor region, using three NODDI parameter maps. Radiomics models were developed based on these three NODDI parameter maps and their amalgamation to differentiate between Gb and SBM. Additionally, radiomics models were constructed based on morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]; diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) for performance comparison.ResultsThe validation dataset results revealed that the performance of a single NODDI parameter map model was inferior to that of the combined NODDI model. In the necrotic regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model exhibited less than ideal discriminative capabilities (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.701). For peritumoral edema regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model achieved a moderate level of discrimination (AUC = 0.820). Within the solid tumor regions, the combined NODDI radiomics model demonstrated superior performance (AUC = 0.904), surpassing the models of other VOIs. The comparison results demonstrated that the NODDI model was better than the DWI and DTI models, while those of the morphological MRI and NODDI models were similar.ConclusionThe NODDI radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between Gb and SBM.Clinical relevance statementThe NODDI radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between Gb and SBM, and radiomics features can be incorporated into the multidimensional phenotypic features that describe tumor heterogeneity.Key Points center dot The neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis.center dot Compared with other tumor volumes of interest, the NODDI radiomics model based on solid tumor regions performed best in distinguishing the two types of tumors.center dot The performance of the single-parameter NODDI model was inferior to that of the combined-parameter NODDI model.Key Points center dot The neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis.center dot Compared with other tumor volumes of interest, the NODDI radiomics model based on solid tumor regions performed best in distinguishing the two types of tumors.center dot The performance of the single-parameter NODDI model was inferior to that of the combined-parameter NODDI model.Key Points center dot The neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) radiomics model showed promising performance for preoperative discrimination between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis.center dot Compared with other tumor volumes of interest, the NODDI radiomics model based on solid tumor regions performed best in distinguishing the two types of tumors.center dot The performance of the single-parameter NODDI model was inferior to that of the combined-parameter NODDI model.

N2  -  Background: Preoperative functional MRI (fMRI) is one of several techniques developed to localize critical brain structures and brain tumors. However, the usefulness of fMRI for preoperative surgical planning and its potential effect on neurologic outcomes remain unclear.
Purpose: To assess the overall postoperative morbidity among patients with brain tumors by using preoperative fMRI versus surgery without this tool or with use of standard (nonfunctional) neuronavigation.; Materials and Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies across major databases from 1946 to June 20, 2020, were conducted. Inclusion criteria were original studies that (a) included patients with brain tumors, (b) performed preoperative neuroimaging workup with fMRI, (c) investigated the usefulness of a preoperative or intraoperative functional neuroimaging technique and used that technique to resect cerebral tumors, and (d) reported postoperative clinical measures. Pooled estimates for adverse event rate (ER) effect size (log ER, log odds ratio, or Hedges g) with 95% CIs were computed by using a random-effects model.; Results: Sixty-eight studies met eligibility criteria (3280 participants; 58.9% men 1555 of 2641; mean age, 46 years 6 8 standard deviation). Functional deterioration after surgical procedure was less likely to occur when fMRI mapping was performed before the operation (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.53; P < .001), and postsurgical Karnofsky performance status scores were higher in patients who underwent fMRI mapping (Hedges g, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.21, 1.11; P =.004). Craniotomies for tumor resection performed with preoperative fMRI were associated with a pooled adverse ER of 11% (95% CI: 8.4, 13.1), compared with a 21.0% ER (95% CI: 12.2, 33.5) in patients who did not undergo fMRI mapping.; Conclusion: From the currently available data, the benefit of preoperative functional MRI planning for the resection of brain tumors appears to reduce postsurgical morbidity, especially when used with other advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-tensor imaging, intraoperative MRI, or cortical stimulation.

N2  -  Introduction: Structural and functional brain white matter abnormalities are poorly characterized in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Methods: We examined the prevalence of the brain white matter microstructure disruption using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and its association with hemodynamic performance and cognitive defects in 49 incident hemodialysis (HD) patients and compared these to 25 age-matched normal controls. We analyzed fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of the images, a voxelwise statistical analysis was done using tract-based spatial statistics. Hemodynamic assessment was done using extrema points analysis model of continuous blood pressure monitoring. Findings: We found significant white matter damage in HD patients compared with normal controls (peak FA 0.471 +/- 0.031 vs 0.486 +/- 0.022 P = 0.023, peak MD 0.00194 +/- 0.000363 10(-3) mm(2).s(-1) vs 0.00167 +/- 0.0003 10(-3) mm(2).s(-1) P = 0.002). There was diffuse pattern of white matter damage in HD patients, which was independent of age, gender, and the presence of ischaemic heart disease and diabetes with significantly lower FA values in HD patients than normal controls (0.467 +/- 0.037 vs 0.507 +/- 0.026, P < 0.05 corrected for family wise error. HD patients had worse cognitive scores that correlated with white matter damage (for peak FA, Montreal cognitive assessment r = 0.478 P = 0.001, Trail A r = -0.486 P = 0.001, Trail B r = -0.464 P = 0.001; for peak MD, Montreal cognitive assessment r = -0.533 P < 0.001, Trail A r = 0.641 P < 0.001, Trail B r = 0.514 P < 0.001). In a multivariable linear regression analysis that included age, smoking, the presence of ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, higher frequency of mean arterial blood pressure extrema points during HD was independently associated with white matter damage (beta = -0.296, P = 0.036, Adjusted R-2 for the whole model = 0.400). Discussion: End-stage kidney disease patients on HD have more brain white matter damage and cognitive impairment than age-matched controls that are linked to hemodynamic functional measures.

N2  -  The increasing development of novel targeted therapies for treating solid tumors has necessitated the development of technology to determine their efficacy in preclinical animal models. One such technology that can non-invasively quantify early changes in tumor cellularity as a result of an efficacious therapy is diffusion MRI. In this overview we present some theories as to the origin of diffusion changes as a result of tumor therapy, a robust methodology for acquisition of apparent diffusion coefficient maps and some applications of determining therapeutic efficacy in a variety therapeutic regimens and animal models.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the clinical feasibility of a quantitative sodium 23 (Na-23) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol developed for breast tumor assessment and to compare it with 7-T diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
Materials and Methods: Written informed consent in this institutional review board-approved study was obtained from eight healthy volunteers and 17 patients with 20 breast tumors (five benign, 15 malignant). To achieve the best image quality and reproducibility, the Na-23 sequence was optimized and tested on phantoms and healthy volunteers. For in vivo quantification of absolute tissue sodium concentration (TSC), an external phantom was used. Static magnetic field, or B-0, and combined transmit and receive radiofrequency field, or B-1, maps were acquired, and image quality, measurement reproducibility, and accuracy testing were performed. Bilateral Na-23 and DWI sequences were performed before contrast material-enhanced MR imaging in patients with breast tumors. TSC and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and correlated for healthy glandular tissue and benign and malignant lesions.; Results: The Na-23 MR imaging protocol is feasible, with 1.5-mm inplane resolution and 16-minute imaging time. Good image quality was achieved, with high reproducibility (mean TSC values +- standard deviation for the test, 36 mmol per kilogram of wet weight +- 2 range, 34-37 mmolkg; for the retest, 37 mmolkg +- 1 range, 35-39 mmolkg; P = .610) and accuracy (r = 0.998, P < .001). TSC values in normal glandular and adipose breast tissue were 35 mmolkg +- 3 and 18 mmolkg +- 3, respectively. In malignant lesions (mean size, 31 mm +- 24; range, 6-92 mm), the TSC of 69 mmolkg +- 10 was, on average, 49% higher than that in benign lesions (mean size, 14 mm +- 12; range, 6-35 mm), with a TSC of 47 mmolkg 6 8 (P =.002). There were similar ADC differences between benign (1.78 +- 0.23 X 10(-3) mm(2)sec) and malignant (1.03 +- 0.23 X 10(-3) mm(2)sec) tumors (P = .002). ADC and TSC were inversely correlated (r = 20.881, P < .001).; Conclusion: Quantitative Na-23 MR imaging is clinically feasible, may provide good differentiation between malignant and benign breast lesions, and demonstrates an inverse correlation with ADC.

N2  -  In recent decades computer-aided technologies have become prevalent in medicine, however, cancer drugs are often only tested on in vitro cell lines from biopsies. We derive a full three-dimensional model of inhomogeneous -anisotropic diffusion in a tumor region coupled to a binary population model, which simulates in vivo scenarios faster than traditional cell-line tests. The diffusion tensors are acquired using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging from a patient diagnosed with glioblastoma multiform. Then we numerically simulate the full model with finite element methods and produce drug concentration heat maps, apoptosis hotspots, and dose-response curves. Finally, predictions are made about optimal injection locations and volumes, which are presented in a form that can be employed by doctors and oncologists.

N2  -  Following diffuse traumatic brain injury, there may be persistent functional or psychological deficits despite the presence of normal conventional MR images. Previous experimental animal and human studies have shown diffusion abnormalities following focal brain injury. Our aim was to quantify changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and absolute relaxation times of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in humans following traumatic brain injury. Twenty-three patients admitted with a diagnosis of head injury (nine mild, eight moderate, and six severe) were scanned an average of 7.6 days after injury using a quantitative echo planar imaging acquisition to obtain co-registered T1, T2, and ADC parametric maps. Mean NAWM values were compared with a control group (n = 13). The patient group showed a small but significant increase in ADC in NAWM, with no significant change in T1 or T2 relaxation times. There was a correlation between injury severity and increasing ADC (p = 0.03) but no correlation with either T1 or T2, suggesting that ADC is a sensitive and independent marker of diffuse white matter tissue damage following traumatic insult. None of the patients had a reduced ADC, making ischaemia unlikely in this cohort. Pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain diffusely raised ADC include vasogenic edema, chronic ischemic phenomena, or changes in tissue cytoarchitecture or neurofilament alignment.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Awake surgery represents the gold standard for resection of brain tumors close to the language network. However, in some cases patients may be considered not eligible for awake craniotomy. In these cases, a personalized brain mapping of the language network may be achieved by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), which can guide resection in patients under general anesthesia. Here the authors describe their tailored nTMS-based strategy and analyze its impact on the extent of tumor resection (EOR) and language outcome in a series of patients not eligible for awake surgery.
METHODS The authors reviewed data from all patients harboring a brain tumor in or close to the language network who were considered not eligible for awake surgery and were operated on during asleep surgery between January 2017 and July 2022, under the intraoperative guidance of nTMS data. The authors analyzed the effectiveness of nTMS-based mapping data in relation to 1) the ability of the nTMS-based mapping to stratify patients according to surgical risks, 2) the occurrence of postoperative language deficits, and 3) the EOR.; RESULTS A total of 176 patients underwent preoperative nTMS cortical language mapping and nTMS-based tractography of language fascicles. According to the nTMS-based mapping, tumors in 115 patients (65.3%) were identified as true-eloquent tumors because of a close spatial relationship with the language network. Conversely, tumors in 61 patients (34.7%) for which the nTMS mapping disclosed a location at a safer distance from the network were identified as false-eloquent tumors. At 3 months postsurgery, a permanent language deficit was present in 13 patients (7.3%). In particular, a permanent deficit was observed in 12 of 115 patients (10.4%) with true- eloquent tumors and in 1 of 61 patients (1.6%) with false- eloquent lesions. With nTMS-based mapping, neurosurgeons were able to distinguish trueeloquent from false-eloquent tumors in a significant number of cases based on the occurrence of deficits at discharge (p < 0.0008) and after 3 months from surgery (OR 6.99, p = 0.03). Gross-total resection was achieved in 80.1% of patients overall and in 69.5% of patients with true-eloquent lesions and 100% of patients with false-eloquent tumors.; CONCLUSIONS nTMS-based mapping allows for reliable preoperative mapping of the language network that may be used to stratify patients according to surgical risks. nTMS-guided asleep surgery should be considered a good alternative for personalized preoperative brain mapping of the language network that may increase the possibility of safe and effective resection of brain tumors in the dominant hemisphere whenever awake mapping is not feasible. https: thejns.orgdoiabs10.31712022.9.FOCUS22415

N2  -  The purpose of the current study was to quantify the reduction in T2 signal abnormality accompanying administration of the anti-angiogenic drug bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients using a voxel-wise differential quantitative T2 (DQT2) mapping technique. Twenty-six patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab were scanned before and 4-6 weeks after treatment on a 1.5T clinical MR scanner. Quantitative T2 maps were created from proton density and T2-weighted images acquired using a standard multi-echo fast-spin echo sequence. T2 maps after treatment were co-registered with T2 maps prior to treatment in the same patient, and then voxel-wise subtraction was performed to create DQT2 maps for each patient. Results suggest DQT2 maps allow visualization and quantification of voxel-wise T2 changes resulting from anti-VEGF therapy. Results demonstrated a significant decrease in T2 within pre-treatment T2 abnormal regions (mean reduction = 49.4 ms at 1.5T) following anti-VEGF treatment (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P < 0.0001). An elevated residual, post-treatment, median T2 was predictive of both progression-free (Log-rank, P = 0.0074) and overall survival (Log-rank, P = 0.0393).

N2  -  Objectives: This study maps the lipid distributions based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in-and opposedphase (IOP) sequence and correlates the findings generated from lipid map to histological grading of glioma.
Methods: Forty histologically proven glioma patients underwent a standard MRI tumour protocol with the addition of IOP sequence. The regions of tumour (solid enhancing, solid non-enhancing, and cystic regions) were delineated using snake model (ITK-SNAP) with reference to structural and diffusion MRI images. The lipid distribution map was constructed based on signal loss ratio (SLR) obtained from the IOP imaging. The mean SLR values of the regions were computed and compared across the different glioma grades.; Results: The solid enhancing region of glioma had the highest SLR for both Grade II and III. The mean SLR of solid non-enhancing region of tumour demonstrated statistically significant difference between the WHO grades (grades II, III & IV) (mean SLRII = 0.04, mean SLRIII = 0.06, mean SLRIV = 0.08, & p < .01). A strong positive correlation was seen between WHO grades with mean SLR on lipid map of solid non-enhancing (rho = 0.68, p < .01).; Conclusion: Lipid quantification via lipid map provides useful information on lipid landscape in tumour heterogeneity characterisation of glioma. This technique adds to the surgical diagnostic yield by identifying biopsy targets. It can also be used as an adjunct grading tool for glioma as well as to provide information about lipidomics landscape in glioma development.

N2  -  PurposeCombining multiple imaging biomarkers in one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session would be beneficial to gain more data pertaining to tumor vasculature under therapy. Therefore, simultaneous measurement of perfusion, permeability, and vessel size imaging (VSI) using a gradient echo spin echo (GE-SE) sequence with injection of a clinically approved gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent was assessed in an orthotopic glioma model.
Materials and MethodsA combined spin echo gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence was implemented using a single contrast agent Gd diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). This sequence was tested in a mouse brain tumor model (U87_MG), also under treatment with an antiangiogenic agent (bevacizumab). T-2 maps and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were used to differentiate regions of cell death and viable tumor tissue.; ResultsIn viable tumor tissue regional blood volume was 5.70.6% in controls and 5.2 +- 0.3% in treated mice. Vessel size was 18.1 +- 2.4 m in controls and 12.8 +- 2.0 m in treated mice, which correlated with results from immunohistochemistry. Permeability (K-trans) was close to zero in treated viable tumor tissue and 0.062 +- 0.024 min(-1) in controls.; ConclusionOur MRI method allows simultaneous assessment of several physiological and morphological parameters and extraction of MRI biomarkers for vasculature. These could be used for treatment monitoring of novel therapeutic agents such as antiangiogenic drugs.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:1310-1318. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  LITT is a minimally-invasive laser ablation technique used to treat a wide variety of intracranial lesions. Difficulties performing intraoperative mapping have limited its adoption for lesions in/near eloquent regions. In this institutional case series, we demonstrate the utility of fMRI-adjunct planning for LITT near language or motor areas. Six out of 7 patients proceeded with LITT after fMRI-based tractography determined adequate safety margins for ablation. All underwent successful ablation without new or worsening postoperative symptoms requiring adjuvant corticosteroids, including those with preexisting deficits. fMRI is an easily accessible adjunct which may potentially reduce chances of complications in LITT near eloquent structures.

N2  -  Object. The authors describe the first shared-resource, 3-T intraoperative MR (ioMR) imaging system and analyze its impact on low-grade glioma (LGG) resection with an emphasis on the use of intraoperative proton MR spectroscopy.
Methods. The Acibadem University ioMR imaging facility houses a 3-T Siemens Trio system and consists of interconnected but independent MR imaging and Surgical suites. Neurosurgery is performed using regular ferromagnetic equipment, and a patient can be transferred to the ioMR imaging system within 1.5 minutes by using a floating table. The ioMR imaging protocol takes < 10 minutes including the transfer, and the authors obtain very high-resolution T2-weighted MR images without the use of intravenous contrast. Functional sequences are performed when needed. A new 5-pin headrest-head coil combination and floating transfer table were specifically designed for this system.; Results. Since the facility became operational in June 2004, 56 LGG resections have been performed using ioMR imaging, and > 19,000 outpatient MR imaging procedures have been conducted. First-look MR imaging studies led to further resection attempts in 37.5% of cases as well as a 32.3% increase in the number of gross-total resections. Intraoperative ultrasonography detected 16% of the tumor remnants. Intraoperative proton MR spectroscopy and diffusion weighted MR imaging were used to differentiate residual tumor tissue from peritumoral parenchymal changes. Functional and diffusion tensor MR imaging sequences were used both pre- and postoperatively but not intraoperatively. No infections or other procedure-related complications were encountered.; Conclusions. This novel, shared-resource, ultrahigh-field, 3-T ioMR imaging system is a cost-effective means of affording a highly capable ioMR imaging system and increases the efficiency of LGG resections.

N2  -  Neurosurgery has primarily been concerned with resective or ablative techniques for the accurate removal of pathological tissue with the minimal disruption of surrounding healthy neuronal matter. There have been numerous advances in neurosurgery which have aided the neurosurgeon to achieve this aim including the development of microsurgical, endoscopic and endovascular techniques. Functional neurosurgery has also seen a particular resurgence over the last 15 years with the identification of new anatomical targets and clinical indications. Technological advances in neuroimaging are providing many new adjuncts to the neurosurgeon's armamentarium. Neuronavigation systems and intra-operative imaging have improved success in surgical removal of tumours from the central nervous system. Accurate epilepsy surgery requires imaging of the epileptogenic zone and accurate identification of adjacent eloquent cortex. New imaging modalities such as PET, SPECT, and fMRI can now be used in order to reduce neurological deficits resulting from surgery. This review highlights some of the major advances in neurosurgery and discusses the impact of neuronavigation and functional imaging in tumour surgery and epilepsy surgery.

N2  -  Acute ischemic stroke triggers complex neurovascular, neuroinflammatory and synaptic alterations. Aspirin and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, have beneficial effects on cerebrovascular diseases. DHA is the precursor of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which downregulates apoptosis and, in turn, promotes cell survival. Here we have tested the effect of aspirin plus DHA administration and discovered the synthesis of aspirin-triggered NPD1 (AT-NPD1) in the brain. Then we performed the total chemical synthesis of this molecule and tested in the setting of 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Neurological status was evaluated at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days. At 3 h post-stroke onset, an intravenous administration of 333 mu g/kg of AT-NPD1 sodium salt. (AT-NPD1-SS) or methyl-ester (AT-NPD1-ME) or vehicle (saline) as treatment was given. On day 7, ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brains was conducted on 11.7 T MRI. T2WI, 3D volumes, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were generated. In addition, infarct volumes and number of GFAP (reactive astrocytes), ED-1 (activated microglia/macrophages) and SMI-71-positive vessels were counted in the cortex and striatum at the level of the central lesion. All animals showed similar values for rectal and cranial temperatures, arterial blood gases, and plasma glucose during and after MCAo. Treatment with both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME significantly improved neurological scores compared to saline treatment at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 7 days. Total lesion volumes computed from T2WI images were significantly reduced by both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME treatment in the cortex (by 44% and 81%), striatum (by 61% and 77%) and total infarct (by 48% and 78%, respectively). Brain edema, computed from T2WI in the cortex (penumbra) and striatum (core), was elevated in the saline group. In contrast, both AT-NPD1 decreased water content in the striatum on day 7.3D volumes, computed from T2WI, were dramatically reduced with both AT-NPD1 and the lesion was mostly localized in the subcortical areas. Treatment with both AT-NPD1-SS and AT-NPD1-ME significantly reduced cortical (by 76% and 96%), subcortical (by 61% and 70%) and total (69% and 84%, respectively) infarct volumes as defined by histopathology. In conclusion, a novel biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of AT-NPD1 mediator in the brain was discovered. In addition, administration of synthetic AT-NPD1, in either its sodium salt or as the methyl ester, was able to attenuate cerebral ischemic injury which leads to a novel approach for pharmaceutical intervention and clinical translation.

N2  -  Object. The authors investigated the relationship between the time course of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes and stress protein induction, ischemic neuroglial damage, and cerebral protein synthesis (CPS) after temporary focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
Methods. In Group 1, ADC changes were measured on magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained during the second half of a 1-hour middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, during a 1-hour reperfusion, and after 23 hours of reperfusion in rats. Immunohistochemical studies for heat shock protein (hsp) 70, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neuronal nuclear (NeuN) protein were performed. In Group II, CPS was assessed using autoradiographic studies obtained after occlusion.; At 36 minutes of occlusion, MR imaging demonstrated significantly less ADC reduction in the frontoparietal cortex (82 +- 9% of the contralateral hemisphere) than in the striatum (64 +- 11%; p < 0.05). After 1 hour of reperfusion, the lesion resolved and the difference between cortex and striatum was no longer evident. After 23 hours of reperfusion, the ADC lesion recurred in striatum (76 +- 12%) compared with frontoparietal cortex (100 +- 11%; p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical studies showed hsp 70 expression and an increased GFAP reactivity localized in the frontoparietal cortex of the ischemic hemisphere, along with a significant drop in striatal NeuN immunoreactivity. A trend toward greater reduction in striatal CPS (53 +- 15%) than in frontoparietal cortex CPS (78 +- 23%) was also observed.; Conclusions. Sequential ADC maps correlate with the expression of neuroglial stress and injury markers after temporary focal ischemia in rats, distinguishing the striatum (infarct core) from the cortex (ischemic penumbra). A greater reduction in striatal CPS further supports the conclusion that the striatum is more susceptible to temporary MCA occlusion than the cortex.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiation between tumor recurrence and treatment-related brain injury is often difficult with conventional MRI. We hypothesized that the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could help differentiate these 2 conditions, because water diffusion may be greater for necrotic tissues in the treatment-related brain injury than for tumor tissues in recurrence. Our aim was to analyze whether DWI findings of recurrent tumor are distinct from those of radiation necrosis.
METHODS: Seventeen patients were examined prospectively. Two readers assessed the images by consensus for homogeneity and signal intensity of the lesions. Five regions of interest were drawn within the lesions on trace DWI images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The minimal, maximal, and mean values of each lesion were compared between the 2 groups. Findings in 12 of 17 patients were verified histologically by surgery or biopsy; the diagnoses in the remaining 5 patients were made on the basis of follow-up MRI findings and clinical follow-up.; RESULTS: There were a total of 20 lesions; 12 lesions were due to radiation necrosis and 8 lesions to tumor recurrence. In the radiation necrosis group, 8 lesions had marked hypointensity. In the recurrence group, however, no marked hypointensity was seen. The maximal ADC values within each lesion were significantly smaller for the recurrence group than for the necrosis group (P = .039).; CONCLUSION. Radiation necrosis usually showed heterogeneity on DWI images and often included spotty, marked hypointensity. Significant difference was found in the maximal ADC values between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence. DWI was useful in differentiating recurrent neoplasm from radiation necrosis.

N2  -  Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive form of brain tumor, is a disease marked by extensive invasion into the surrounding brain. Interstitial fluid flow (IFF), or the movement of fluid within the spaces between cells, has been linked to increased invasion of GBM cells. Better characterization of IFF could elucidate underlying mechanisms driving this invasion in vivo. Here, we develop a technique to non-invasively measure interstitial flow velocities in the glioma microenvironment of mice using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a common clinical technique. Using our in vitro model as a phantom "tumor" system and in silico models of velocity vector fields, we show we can measure average velocities and accurately reconstruct velocity directions. With our combined MR and analysis method, we show that velocity magnitudes are similar across four human GBM cell line xenograft models and the direction of fluid flow is heterogeneous within and around the tumors, and not always in the outward direction. These values were not linked to the tumor size. Finally, we compare our flow velocity magnitudes and the direction of flow to a classical marker of vessel leakage and bulk fluid drainage, Evans blue. With these data, we validate its use as a marker of high and low IFF rates and IFF in the outward direction from the tumor border in implanted glioma models. These methods show, for the first time, the nature of interstitial fluid flow in models of glioma using a technique that is translatable to clinical and preclinical models currently using contrast-enhanced MRI.

N2  -  ObjectivesThe preoperative prediction of the WHO grade of a meningioma is important for further treatment plans. This study aimed to assess whether texture analysis (TA) based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps could non-invasively classify meningiomas accurately using tree classifiers.MethodsA pathology database was reviewed to identify meningioma patients who underwent tumour resection in our hospital with preoperative routine MRI scanning and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) between January 2011 and August 2017. A total of 152 meningioma patients with 421 preoperative ADC maps were included. Four categories of features, namely, clinical features, morphological features, average ADC values and texture features, were extracted. Three machine learning classifiers, namely, classic decision tree, conditional inference tree and decision forest, were built on these features from the training dataset. Then the performance of each classifier was evaluated and compared with the diagnosis made by two neuro-radiologists.ResultsThe ADC value alone was unable to distinguish three WHO grades of meningiomas. The machine learning classifiers based on clinical, morphological features and ADC value could achieve equivalent diagnostic performance (accuracy = 62.96%) compared to two experienced neuro-radiologists (accuracy = 61.11% and 62.04%). Upon analysis, the decision forest that was built with 23 selected texture features and the ADC value from the training dataset achieved the best diagnostic performance in the testing dataset (kappa = 0.64, accuracy = 79.51%).ConclusionsDecision forest with the ADC value and ADC map-based texture features is a promising multiclass classifier that could potentially provide more precise diagnosis and aid diagnosis in the near future.Key Points center dot A precise preoperative prediction of the WHO grade of a meningioma brings benefits to further treatment plans.center dot Machine learning models based on clinical, morphological features and ADC value could achieve equivalent diagnostic performance compared to experienced neuroradiologists.center dot The decision forest model built with 23 selected texture features and the ADC value achieved the best diagnostic performance (kappa = 0.64, accuracy = 79.51%).

N2  -  PurposeDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is important for differentiating residual tumor and subacute infarctions in early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. In cases of pneumocephalus and especially in the presence of intraventricular trapped air, conventional echo-planar imaging (EPI) DWI is distorted by susceptibility artifacts. The performance and robustness of a newly developed DWI sequence using the stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) was evaluated in patients after neurosurgical operations with early postoperative MRI.MethodsWe compared EPI and STEAM DWI of 43 patients who received 3-Tesla MRI within 72 h after a neurosurgical operation between 1 October 2019 and 30 September 2021. We analyzed susceptibility artifacts originating from air and blood and whether these artifacts compromised the detection of ischemic changes after surgery. The DWI sequences were (i) visually rated and (ii) volumetrically analyzed.ResultsIn 28 of 43 patients, we found severe and diagnostically relevant artifacts in EPI DWI, but none in STEAM DWI. In these cases, in which artifacts were caused by intracranial air, they led to a worse detection of ischemic lesions and thus to a possible failed diagnosis or lack of judgment using EPI DWI. Additionally, volumetric analysis demonstrated a 14% smaller infarct volume detected with EPI DWI. No significant differences in visual rating and volumetric analysis were detected among the patients without severe artifacts.ConclusionThe newly developed version of STEAM DWI with highly undersampled radial encodings is superior to EPI DWI in patients with postoperative pneumocephalus.

N2  -  We have performed MRI examinations to determine the water diffusion tensor in the brain of six patients who were admitted to the hospital within 12 h after the onset of cerebral ischemic symptoms. The examinations have been carried out immediately after admission, and thereafter at varying intervals up to 90 days post admission. Maps of the trace of the diffusion tensor, the fractional anisotropy and the lattice index, as well as maps of cerebral blood perfusion parameters, were generated to quantitatively assess the character of the water diffusion tensor in the infarcted area. In patients with significant perfusion deficits and substantial lesion volume changes, four of six cases, our measurements show a monotonic and significant decrease in the diffusion anisotropy within the ischemic lesion as a function of time. We propose that retrospective analysis of this quantity, in combination with brain tissue segmentation and cerebral perfusion maps, may be used in future studies to assess the severity of the ischemic event.

N2  -  Dysphagia is a common deficit after a stroke, and it is frequently associated with pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and poor quality of life. It is not yet fully clear which brain regions are directly related to swallowing, and how lesions affect swallow physiology. This study aimed to assess the statistical relationship between acute stroke lesion locations and impairment of specific aspects of swallow physiology. We performed lesion symptom mapping with 68 retrospectively recruited, acute, first-ever ischemic stroke patients. Lesions were determined on diffusion weighted MRI scans. Post-stroke swallow physiology was determined using the Modified Barium Swallow Study Impairment Profile (MBSImP(C)(TM)). The relationship between brain lesion location and 17 physiological aspects of swallowing were tested using voxel-based and region-based statistical associations corrected for multiple comparisons using permutation thresholding. We found that laryngeal elevation, anterior hyoid excursion, laryngeal vestibular closure, and pharyngeal residue were associated with lesioned voxels or regions of interests. All components showed distinct and overlapping lesion locations, mostly in the right hemisphere, and including cortical regions (inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula), subcortical regions (thalamus, amygdala) and white matter tracts (superior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule, ansa lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus). Our findings indicate that different aspects of post-stroke swallow physiology are associated with distinct lesion locations, primarily in the right hemisphere, and primarily including sensory-motor integration areas and their corresponding white matter tracts. Future studies are needed to expand on our findings and thus, support the development of a neuroanatomical model of post-stroke swallow physiology and treatment approaches targeting the neurophysiological underpinnings of swallowing post stroke.

N2  -  Surgical resection of gliomas is a well-established treatment. It allows a histo-genetic diagnosis, a mass effect reduction, an intracranial hypertension treatment, a recovery of an eventual neurological deficit induced by the mass effect, but mostly brings a significant survival. New imaging sequences are optimizing the surgical management of brain tumors by bringing precisions on the tumor morphology, on cortical/subcortical eloquent areas (functional and diffusion MRI), on histology (spectroscopic MR). If the tumor is located in eloquent area, surgery is performed under electrostimulation control to take into account cerebral plasticity and to avoid postoperative functional deficits. Neuronavigation, per-operative echography, and per-operative MRI are recognized tools for optimizing the tumor resection. Ongoing researches concern the adjunction of local treatments within the surgical field (photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, convection immunotherapy...), but also the development of minimal invasive procedures (radiosurgery, high intensity focalized ultrasounds, laser interstitial thermal therapy).

N2  -  An important problem of the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to achieve some noise reduction of the data without blurring the shape of the activation areas. As a novel solution to this problem, recently the propagation-separation (PS) approach has been proposed. PS is a structure adaptive smoothing method that adapts to different shapes of activation areas. In this paper, we demonstrate how this method results in a more accurate localization of brain activity. First, it is shown in numerical simulations that PS is superior over Gaussian smoothing with respect to the accurate description of the shape of activation clusters and results in less false detections. Second, in a study of 37 presurgical planning cases we found that PS and Gaussian smoothing often yield different results, and we present examples showing aspects of the superiority of PS as applied to presurgical planning.

N2  -  Recent diffusion MRI studies of stroke in humans and animals have shown that the quantitative parameters characterising the degree of non-Gaussianity of the diffusion process are much more sensitive to ischemic changes than the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) considered so far as the "gold standard''. The observed changes exceeded that of the ADC by a remarkable factor of 2 to 3. These studies were based on the novel non-Gaussian methods, such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and log-normal distribution function imaging (LNDFI). As shown in our previous work investigating the animal stroke model, a combined analysis using two methods, DKI and LNDFI provides valuable complimentary information. In the present work, we report the application of three non-Gaussian diffusion models to quantify the deviations from the Gaussian behaviour in stroke induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat brains: the gamma-distribution function (GDF), the stretched exponential model (SEM), and the biexponential model. The main goal was to compare the sensitivity of various non-Gaussian metrics to ischemic changes and to investigate if a combined application of several models will provide added value in the assessment of stroke. We have shown that two models, GDF and SEM, exhibit a better performance than the conventional method and allow for a significantly enhanced visualization of lesions. Furthermore, we showed that valuable information regarding spatial properties of stroke lesions can be obtained. In particular, we observed a stratified cortex structure in the lesions that were well visible in the maps of the GDF and SEM metrics, but poorly distinguishable in the ADC-maps. Our results provided evidence that cortical layers tend to be differently affected by ischemic processes.

N2  -  Carotid revascularization (endarterectomy, stenting) prevents stroke; however, procedure-related embolization is common and results in small brain lesions easily identified by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). A crucial barrier to understanding the clinical significance of these lesions has been the lack of a statistical approach to identify vulnerable brain areas. The problem is that the lesions are small, numerous, and non-overlapping. Here we address this problem with a new method, the Convergence Analysis of Micro-Lesions (CAML) technique, an extension of the Anatomic Likelihood Analysis (ALE). The method combines manual lesion tracing, constraints based on known lesion patterns, and convergence analysis to represent regions vulnerable to lesions as probabilistic brain atlases. Two studies were conducted over the course of 12 years in an active, vascular surgery clinic. An analysis in an initial group of 126 patients at 1.5 T MRI was cross-validated in a second group of 80 patients at 3T MRI. In CAML, lesions were manually defined and center points identified. Brains were aligned according to side of surgery since this factor powerfully determines lesion distribution. A convergence based analysis, was performed on each of these groups. Results indicated the most consistent region of vulnerability was in motor and premotor cortex regions. Smaller regions common to both groups included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial parietal regions. Vulnerability of motor cortex is consistent with previous work showing changes in hand dexterity associated with these procedures. The consistency of CAML also demonstrates the feasibility of this new approach to characterize small, diffuse, non-overlapping lesions in patients with multifocal pathologies.

N2  -  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system due to JC polyoma virus infection of oligodendrocytes. PML develops in patients with impaired T-cell function as occurs in HIV, malignancy or immunosuppressive drugs users. Until now no imaging methods have been reported to correlate with clinical status. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a robust MRI tool in investigating white matter architecture and diseases. The aim of our work was to assess diffusion abnormalities in focal white matter lesions in patients with PML and to correlate the lesion load measured with conventional MRI and DWI to clinical variables. We evaluated eight patients with a biopsy or laboratory-supported diagnosis of PML. All patients underwent MRI including conventional sequences ( fluid attenuated inversion recovery-FLAIR) and DWI. Mean diffusivity ( MD) maps were used to quantify diffusion on white matter lesions. Global lesion load was calculated by manually tracing lesions on FLAIR images, while total, central core and peripheral lesion loads were calculated by manually tracing lesions on DWI images. Lesion load obtained with the conventional or DWI-based methods were correlated with clinical variables such as disease duration, disease severity and survival. White matter focal lesions are characterized by a central core with low signal on DWI images and high MD (1.853 x 10(-3) mm2/s), surrounded by a rim of high signal intensity on DWI and lower MD ( 1.1 x 10(-3) mm2/s). The MD value of normal- appearing white matter is higher although not statistically significant (0.783 x 10(-3) mm(2)/ s) with respect to control subjects ( 0.750 x 10(-3) mm2/s). Inter-rater correlations of global lesion load between FLAIR (3.96%) and DWI (3.43%) was excellent (ICC= 0.87). Global lesion load on FLAIR and DWI correlates with disease duration and severity ( respectively, p= 0.037, p= 0.0272 with Karnofsky scale and p= 0.0338 with EDSS on FLAIR images; p= 0.043, p= 0.0296 with Karnofsky scale and p= 0.0365 with EDSS on DW images). Central core lesion load on DWI correlates with disease duration and severity ( respectively p= 0.043, p= 0.0103 with Karnofsky scale and p= 0.0112 with EDSS), while peripheral lesion load does not correlate with any clinical variable. The global lesion load in PML correlates with disease duration and severity. DWI images, which can distinguish within lesions a central core from a peripheral rim, reveal that a larger central core component correlates to a worsened clinical status and longer disease duration. On the other hand the peripheral rim lesion load visualized on DWI images does not correlate with clinical variables and does not achieve obtaining further prognostic information with respect to conventional imaging.

N2  -  Precise identification and preservation of the pyramidal tract during surgery for parenchymal brain tumors is of crucial importance for the avoidance of postoperative deterioration of the motor function. The technique of intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (iDWI) using an intraoperative MR scanner of low magnetic field strength (0.3 Tesla) has been developed. Its clinical usefulness and efficacy were evaluated in 10 surgically treated patients with gliomas (5 men and 5 women, mean age: 41.2 +/- 13.9 years). iDWI permitted visualization of the pyramidal tract on the non-affected side in all 10 cases, and on the affected side in 8 cases. Motion artifacts were observed in four patients, but were not an obstacle to identification of the pyramidal tract. Good correspondence of the anatomical landmarks localization on iDWI and T(1)-weighted imaging was found. All participating neurosurgeons agreed that, in the majority of cases, iDWI was very useful for localization of the pyramidal tract and for clarification of its spatial relationships with the tumor. In conclusion, image quality and accuracy of the iDWI obtained with an MR scanner of low magnetic field strength (0.3 Tesla) are sufficient for possible incorporation into an intraoperative neuronavigation system. The use of iDWI in addition to structural iMRI and subcortical functional mapping with electrical stimulation can potentially result in a reduction of the postoperative morbidity after aggressive surgical removal of lesions located in the vicinity to the motor white matter tracts.

N2  -  Background: Thalamopeduncular tumors are challenging lesions arising at the junction between the thalamus and the cerebral peduncle. They represent 1-5% of pediatric brain tumors, are mainly pilocytic astrocytoma and occur within the first two decades of life. To date, the optimal treatment remains unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who underwent surgery for thalamopeduncular tumors in the Academic Pediatric Neurosurgery Unit of Padova and Verona from 2005 to 2022. We collected information on age, sex, symptoms, preoperative and postoperative neuroradiological studies, histological specimens, surgical approaches, and follow-up. Results: We identified eight patients with a mean age of 9 years. All lesions were pilocytic astrocytoma. The main symptoms were spastic hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsy, headache, and ataxia. The corticospinal tract was studied in all patients using diffusion-tensor imaging brain MRI and in two patients using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. The transsylvian approach was the most frequently used. A gross total resection was achieved in two patients, a subtotal resection in five and a partial resection in one. In three patients, a second treatment was performed due to the regrowth of the tumor, performing an additional surgery in two cases and a second-look surgery followed by adjuvant therapy in one. After the surgery, four patients maintained stability in their postoperative neurological exam, two patients improved, and two worsened but in one of them, an improvement during recovery occurred. At the last follow-up available, three patients were disease-free, four had a stable tumor residual, and only one patient died from the progression of the disease. Conclusions: Advanced preoperative tools allow one to define a safe surgical strategy. Due to the indolent behavior of thalamopeduncular tumors, surgery should be encouraged.

N2  -  Background Various studies by MRI exhibit that the corpus callosum (CC) is the most vulnerable to cuprizone administration, detecting the demyelination and remyelination process using different MRI parameters are, however, lacking. Purpose To investigate the sensitivity of multiparametric MRI both in vivo and ex vivo for demyelination and remyelination. Study Type Prospective. Animal Model A cuprizone mice model with an age-matched control group (n = 5), 4-week cuprizone exposure group followed by 9-week on a normal diet (n = 6), and a 13-week cuprizone exposure group (n = 6). Field Strength/Sequence 3D gradient recalled echo, T-2-weighted, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 7.0T and 9.4T. Assessment Quantification of DTI metrics, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and T-2-weighted imaging intensity in major white matter bundles. Statistical Tests Nonparametric permutation tests were used with a cluster-forming threshold as 3.09 (equivalent to P = 0.001), and the significant level as P = 0.05 with family-wise correction. Results In vivo susceptibility values increased from -11.7 to -0.7 ppb (P < 0.001) in CC and from -13.7 to -5.1 ppb (P < 0.001) in the anterior commissure (AC) after the 13-week cuprizone exposure. Ex vivo susceptibility values increased from -25.4 to 7.4 ppb (P < 0.001) in CC and from -41.6 to -15.8 ppb (P < 0.001) in AC. Susceptibility values showed high variations to demyelination for in vivo studies (94.0% in CC, 62.8% in AC). Susceptibility values exhibited higher variations than radial diffusivity for ex vivo studies (129.1% vs. 28.3% in CC, 62.0% vs. 25.0% in AC). In addition to the differential susceptibility variations in different white matter tracts, intraregional demyelination variation was also present not only in CC but also in the AC area by voxel-based analysis. Data Conclusion QSM is sensitive to the demyelination process of cuprizone exposure, which can be a complementary technique to conventional T-2-weighted images and DTI metrics.

N2  -  Purpose: This study aimed at introducing short-T1/T2 compartment to MR fingerprinting (MRF) at 3 T. Water that is bound to myelin macromolecules have significantly shorter T1 and T2 than free water and can be distinguished from free water by multi-compartment analysis. Methods: We developed a new multi-inversion-recovery (mIR) water mapping-MRF based on an unbalanced steady-state coherent sequence (FISP). mIR pulses with an interval of 400 or 500 repetition times (TRs) were inserted into the conventional FISP MRF sequence. Data from our proposed mIR MRF was used to quantify different compartments, including myelin water, gray matter free water, and white matter free water, of brain water by virtue of the iterative non-negative least square (NNLS) with reweighting. Three healthy volunteers were scanned with mIR MRF on a clinical 3 T MRI. Results: Using an extended phase graph simulation, we found that our proposed mIR scheme with four IR pulses allowed differentiation between short and long T1/T2 components. For in vivo experiments, we achieved the quantification of myelin water, gray matter water, and white matter water at an image resolution of 1.17 & times; 1.17 & times; 5 mm3/pixel. As compared to the conventional MRF technique with single IR, our proposed mIR improved the detection of myelin water content. In addition, mIR MRF using spiral-in/out trajectory provided a higher signal level compared with that with spiral-out trajectory. Myelin water quantification using mIR MRF with 4 IR and 5 IR pulses were qualitatively similar. Meanwhile, 5 IR MRF showed fewer artifacts in myelin water detection. Conclusion: We developed a new mIR MRF sequence for the rapid quantification of brain water compartments.

N2  -  Objectives Only 5% to 10% of patients who visit the emergency department (ED) with isolated dizziness without neurologic abnormalities may have central lesions; however, it is important to distinguish central lesions through brain imaging. This study was conducted to create a nomogram to provide an objective medical basis for selectively performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among patients with isolated dizziness. Methods This retrospective observational study enrolled patients who visited the ED of a tertiary hospital with isolated dizziness and underwent diffusion-weighted MRI and subsequently consulted with the departments of neurology, neurosurgery, or otorhinolaryngology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors in patients diagnosed with central lesions to create a nomogram with the significant variables. Results Of the 1,078 patients who were screened, 119 were diagnosed with central lesions. Significant variables in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were albumin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 0.339, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.188 to 0.610, p = 0.0003), inorganic phosphate levels (OR = 0.891, 95% CI = 0.832 to 0.954, p = 0.0010), history of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.170, 95% CI = 1.807 to 5.560, p < 0.0001), presyncope (OR = 3.152, 95% CI = 1.184 to 8.389, p = 0.0216), and nystagmus (OR = 0.365, 95% CI = 0.237 to 0.561, p < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram created with these variables was 0.7315 (95% CI = 0.6842 to 0.7788, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Albumin, inorganic phosphate, previous stroke, presyncope, and nystagmus were associated with the predictive diagnosis of central lesions among patients admitted to the ED with isolated dizziness. The novel nomogram created using these variables can help in objectively determining the need for MRI in patients presenting with isolated dizziness to the ED.

N2  -  Whilst MRI is routinely used for the assessment and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, there is poor correspondence between clinical disability in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) patients and conventional MRI markers of disease activity (e.g., number of enhancing lesions). As PPMS patients show diffuse and global myelin loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of whole-brain myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging in PPMS. Specifically, we sought to use full-brain analysis techniques to: 1) determine the reproducibility of MWF estimates in PPMS brain; 2) compare MWF values in PPMS brain to healthy controls; and 3) establish the relationship between MWF and clinical disability, regionally and globally throughout the brain. Seventeen PPMS patients and seventeen age-matched controls were imaged using a whole-brain multi-component relaxation imaging technique to measure MWF. Analysis of MWF reduction was performed on three spatial levels: 1) histogram; 2) white matter skeleton; and 3) voxel-wise at the single-subject level. From histogram analysis, PPMS patients had significantly reduced global normal appearing white matter MWF (6%, p = 0.04) compared to controls. Focal lesions showed lower MWF values than white matter in controls (61%, p<0.001) and patients (59%, p<0.001). Along the white matter skeleton, MWF was diffusely reduced throughout the PPMS brain, with significant correlations between reduced MWF and increased clinical disability (more severe symptoms), as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, within the corpus callosum and frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital white matter. Correlations with the more specific mental and sensory functional system scores were localized to clinically eloquent locations: reduced MWF was significantly associated with increased mental scores in anterior regions (i.e., frontal lobes and genu of the corpus callosum), and increased sensory scores in more posterior regions closer to the sensory cortex. Individual patient MWF maps were also compared to a normative population atlas, which highlighted areas of statistical difference between the individual patient and the population mean. A significant correlation was found between the volume of significantly reduced MWF and clinical disability (p = 0.008, R = 0.58).
Our results show that clinical disability is reflected in particular regions of cerebral white matter that are consistent between subjects, and illustrates a method to examine tissue alteration throughout the brain of individual patients. These results strongly support the use of MWF imaging to evaluate disease activity in PPMS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in an immunocompromised patient with organ transplantation demonstrated unusual brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Recognition of EBV-positive DLBCL by radiologists on MRI may prevent unnecessary neurosurgical resection, and it could be important to obtain viable cells for accurate diagnosis on stereotactic biopsy because of extensive necrosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left hemiparesis grade Ill and dysarthria lasting for 3 weeks. She underwent kidney transplantation in 2007 and was taking immunosuppressants and had hypothyroidism. Brain MRI showed a 3.8-cm peripheral enhancing lesion with extensive central necrosis in association with marked perilesional edema. The irregular ringlike enhancing lesion showed diffusion restriction and mildly increased regional cerebral blood volume in the rim portion of the mass. 11C-Methionine positron emission tomography revealed slightly increased uptake in the peripheral lesion. The provisional diagnosis was a high-grade glioma. Stereotactic multiple biopsies were performed for the central necrotic area and peripheral enhancing lesion. The nonenhancing areas showed only necrotic material, without viable cells, and the enhancing portion showed viable cells for an accurate diagnosis in a frozen biopsy specimen. The pathologic diagnosis was EBV-positive DLBCL with extensive necrosis. Positron emission tomography of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and neck soft tissues ruled out systemic diseases. She underwent whole-brain radiotherapy at a dose of 30.6 Gy. Eight months later, her neurologic symptoms had improved, with a stable brain lesion and improved perilesional edema.; CONCLUSIONS: We report an immunocompromised patient with EBV-positive DLBCL, which showed atypical MRI findings, including extensive necrosis. Multiple biopsies were required for final diagnosis.

N2  -  High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors. Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine.

N2  -  Background Accurate differentiation of brain infections from necrotic glioblastomas (GBMs) may not always be possible on morphologic MRI or on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI) if these techniques are used independently. Purpose To investigate the combined analysis of DTI and DSC-PWI in distinguishing brain injections from necrotic GBMs. Study Type Retrospective. Population Fourteen patients with brain infections and 21 patients with necrotic GBMs. Field Strength/Sequence 3T MRI, DTI, and DSC-PWI. Assessment Parametric maps of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), coefficient of linear (CL), and planar anisotropy (CP) and leakage corrected cerebral blood volume (CBV) were computed and coregistered with postcontrast T-1-weighted and FLAIR images. All lesions were segmented into the central core and enhancing region. For each region, median values of MD, FA, CL, CP, relative CBV (rCBV), and top 90(th) percentile of rCBV (rCBV(max)) were measured. Statistical Tests All parameters from both regions were compared between brain infections and necrotic GBMs using Mann-Whitney tests. Logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain the best model in distinguishing these two conditions. Results From the central core, significantly lower MD (0.90 x 10(-3) +/- 0.44 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs. 1.66 x 10(-3) +/- 0.62 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P = 0.001), significantly higher FA (0.15 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.03, P < 0.001), and CP (0.07 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.02, P = 0.009) were observed in brain infections compared to those in necrotic GBMs. Additionally, from the contrast-enhancing region, significantly lower rCBV (1.91 +/- 0.95 vs. 2.76 +/- 1.24, P = 0.031) and rCBV(max) (3.46 +/- 1.41 vs. 5.89 +/- 2.06, P = 0.001) were observed from infective lesions compared to necrotic GBMs. FA from the central core and rCBV(max) from enhancing region provided the best classification model in distinguishing brain infections from necrotic GBMs, with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 93%. Data Conclusion Combined analysis of DTI and DSC-PWI may provide better performance in differentiating brain infections from necrotic GBMs. Level of Evidence: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn.

N2  -  Today there are several indications for cerebral perfusion MRI. The major indications routinely used in increasing numbers of imaging centers include cerebrovascular disease, tumor imaging and recently psychiatric disorders. Perfusion MRI is based on the injection of a gadolinium chelate and the rapid acquisition of images as the bolus of contrast agent passes through the blood vessels in the brain. The contrast agent causes a signal change; this signal change over time can be analysed to measure cerebral hemodynamics. The quality of brain perfusion studies is very dependent on the contrast agent used: a robust and strong signal decrease with a compact bolus is needed. MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine, Gd-BOPTA) is the first of a new class of paramagnetic MR contrast agents with a weak affinity for serum proteins. Due to the interaction of Gd-BOPTA with serum albumin, MultiHance presents with significantly higher T1- and T2-relaxivities enabling a sharper bolus profile. This article reviews the indications of perfusion MRI and the performance of MultiHance in MR perfusion of different diseases. Previous studies using perfusion MRI for a variety of purposes required the use of double dose of contrast agent to achieve a sufficiently large signal drop to enable the acquisition of a clear input function and the calculation of perfusion rCBV and rCBF maps of adequate quality. Recent studies with Multi-Hance suggest that only a single dose of this agent is needed to cause a signal drop of about 30% which is sufficient to allow the calculation of high quality rCBV and rCBF maps.

N2  -  Introduction: Preoperative differentiation of benign, atypical and malignant meningiomas would significantly help in surgical planning and treatment. The aim of this study is to look at radio-morphologic behavior of various histopathological types and grades of meningiomas and their diffusion characteristics.
Methods: We performed an analytical cross-sectional study including all patients operated on for meningiomas at our hospital during January 2016 to July 2018. We studied 38 meningiomas in 38 patients aged 14 to 73 years old. All patients underwent MRI prior to surgery, including diffusion-weighted sequences, in a 1.5T scanner. Signal intensity in T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images (b=0, 90 and 1,000), and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient maps within the tumors and in the normal parietal white matter as a reference were evaluated. In the histological study, cellularity, proliferation index, histological grade, and cerebral invasion were evaluated.; Results: There was female predilection with male:female ratio of 1:2.4. Most meningiomas were supratentorial with most common origin being parafalcine and convexity. Of the 38 meningiomas, 31 were WHO grade I, 6 were WHO grade II (atypical) and one was WHO grade III (anaplastic). Among various tumors' behaviors, incomplete CSF cleft, pial invasion and parenchymal invasion were significantly high in high-grade tumors. Similarly, tumors showing pial invasion, breached tumor-brain interface, no capsular enhancement and parenchyma invasion showed significantly low NADC. Mean ADC value was 0.722 +- 7.7x10(-3) mm(2)s (normalized ADC 0.9 +- 0.1) in the atypical group and 0.876 +- 24.56x10(-3) mm(2)s (normalized ADC 1.11 +- 0.31) in the typical group. No statistically significant differences of ADCNADC were found between histologic subtypes. Two subtypes of typical meningiomas, metaplastic and angiomatous meningioma had the highest values in the ADC maps.; Conclusions: MR morphology like pith invasion, breathed tumors brain interface, parenchymal invasion can predict aggressiveness and atypical nature of meningiomas. Meningioma shows moderately restricted diffusion. The signal on the ADC map is associated with tumors cellularity and aggressiveness suggesting its usefulness for predicting the histological grade.

N2  -  Although posttraumatic ischemic stroke in basal ganglia is well recognized in children, basal ganglia infarction after trauma in adult patients has rarely been reported. We recently encountered an adult patient presenting with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), hematoma, and ischemic stroke of the basal ganglia after trauma. A 34-year-old woman presented to our emergency department after a head injury. She presented a drowsy mental state and mild dysarthria. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 12 (E3, V4, and M5). Right hemiparesis and right facial palsy were observed. Acute hemorrhage in the left lentiform nucleus, traumatic SAH in the left Sylvian fissure, and epidural hemorrhage on her right side were observed on computed tomography of the brain. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with diffusion-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping showed an acute infarct in the body of the left caudate nucleus and the upper portion of the left lentiform nucleus. Vessel wall MR imaging and MR angiography indicated no abnormal finding in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Stretching, distorting, and tearing of the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA) originating from the MCA after head trauma may lead to vasospasm or thrombus and result in infarction or hemorrhage in the basal ganglia.

N2  -  Objectives: Determining the grade of a glioma is extremely important for treatment planning and prognosis prediction. The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of multi-parametric perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in preoperative glioma grading.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 63 individuals with brain tumors histologically confirmed, of which 23 had low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and 40 had high-grade gliomas (HGGs) were involved. We conducted this paper on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps using the entire tumor volume method, allowing us to use all ADC values of the tumor. Small-sample regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn to collect parameters of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), from both the tumor core and peritumoral edema. The PWI and DWI metrics were compared to identify the most accurate distinguishing HGGs and LGGs, analyze receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and evaluate the diagnostic performance using solitary parameters and combined.; Results: In diffusion MRI, there were significant differences in minimum ADC and mean ADC between LGGs and HGGs (p<0.05), with the larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.898 found for mean ADC at a cut-off value of 1.275, with sensitivity of 82.6 % and specificity of 90 %. The maximum ADC value did not differ significantly (p>0.05). All perfusion parameters in both the tumor core and peritumoral edema area were significantly greater values in cases of HGG compared to LGG (p<0.001), with the highest AUC of 0.946 found for solid tumor rCBV value (rCBVt), the cut-off is 3.585, sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 100 %. Combining mean ADC and rCBVt provided an excellent AUC of 0.975, a sensitivity of 92.5 %, and a specificity of 91.3 % for differentiating between HGGs and LGGs.; Conclusions: Perfusion and diffusion MRI are valuable in discriminating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, with the major criterion in the decision-making process being the combined mean ADC and rCBVt parameters.

N2  -  Objectives: The objective of this work is to present the software tool ANTONIA, which has been developed to facilitate a quantitative analysis of perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) datasets in general as well as the subsequent multi-parametric analysis of additional datasets for the specific purpose of acute ischemic stroke patient dataset evaluation.
Methods: Three different methods for the analysis of DSC or DCE PWI datasets are currently implemented in ANTONIA, which can be case-specifically selected based on the study protocol. These methods comprise a curve fitting method as well as a deconvolution-based and deconvolution-free method integrating a previously defined arterial input function. The perfusion analysis is extended for the purpose of acute ischemic stroke analysis by additional methods that enable an automatic atlas-based selection of the arterial input function, an analysis of the perfusion-diffusion and DWI-FLAIR mismatch as well as segmentation-based volumetric analyses.; Results: For reliability evaluation, the described software tool was used by two observers for quantitative analysis of 15 datasets from acute ischemic stroke patients to extract the acute lesion core volume, FLAIR ratio, perfusion-diffusion mismatch volume with manually as well as automatically selected arterial input functions, and follow-up lesion volume. The results of this evaluation revealed that the described software tool leads to highly reproducible results for all parameters if the automatic arterial input function selection method is used.; Conclusion: Due to the broad selection of processing methods that are available in the software tool, ANTONIA is especially helpful to support image-based perfusion and acute ischemic stroke research projects.

N2  -  Myelin content of the cerebral cortex likely impacts cognitive functioning, but this notion has scarcely been investigated in vivo in humans. Here we tested for a relationship between intracortical myelin and a direct measure of neural activity in the form of the electrophysiological response error-related negativity (ERN). Using magnetic resonance imaging, myelin mapping was performed in 81 healthy adults aged 40-60 years by means of a T-1- and T-2-weighted (T(1)w/T(2)w) signal intensity ratio approach. Error trials on a version of the Eriksen flanker task triggered the ERN, a negative deflection of the event-related potential reflecting performance monitoring. Compelling evidence from neuroimaging, lesion, and source localization studies indicates that the ERN stems from the cingulate cortex. Vertex-wise analyses across the cingulate demonstrated that increased amplitude of the ERN was related to higher levels of intracortical myelin in the left posterior cingulate cortex. The association was independent of general ability level and subjacent white matter myelin. The results fit the notion that degree of myelin within the posterior cingulate cortex as measured by T(1)w/T(2)w signal intensity plays a role in error processing and cognitive control through the relationship with neural activity as measured by ERN amplitude, potentially by facilitating local neural synchronization.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of a simplified method based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquired with three b-values to measure tissue perfusion linked to microcirculation, to validate it against from perfusion-related parameters derived from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and to investigate its utility to differentiate low-from high-grade gliomas.
Materials and Methods: The prospective study was approved by the local institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. From May 2016 and May 2017, 50 patients confirmed with glioma were assessed with multi-b- value DWI and DCE MR imaging at 3.0 T. Besides conventional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(0,1000)) map, perfusion-related parametric maps for IVIM-derived perfusion fraction (f) and pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), DCE MR imaging-derived pharmacokinetic metrics, including K-trans, v(e) and v(p), as well as a metric named simplified perfusion fraction (SPF), were generated. Correlation between perfusion-related parameters was analyzed by using the Spearman rank correlation. All imaging parameters were compared between the low-grade (n = 19) and high-grade (n = 31) groups by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The diagnostic performance for tumor grading was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.; Results: SPF showed strong correlation with IVIM-derived f and D* (rho = 0.732 and 0.716, respectively; both P < 0.001). Compared with f, SPF was more correlated with DCE MR imaging-derived K-trans (rho = 0.607; P < 0.001) and v(p) (rho = 0.397; P = 0.004). Among all parameters, SPF achieved the highest accuracy for differentiating low-from high-grade gliomas, with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.942, which was significantly higher than that of ADC(0,1000) (P = 0.004). By using SPF as a discriminative index, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 87.1% and 94.7%, respectively, at the optimal cut-off value of 19.26%.; Conclusion: The simplified method to measure tissue perfusion based on DWI by using three b-values may be helpful to differentiate low-from high-grade gliomas. SPF may serve as a valuable alternative to measure tumor perfusion in gliomas in a noninvasive, convenient and efficient way.

N2  -  We aimed to assess the role of preoperative diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in the surgical planning and prognostication of the postoperative outcome of patients with lesions in the eloquent areas of the brain. From 2006 to 2009, 50 patients were preoperatively evaluated with DTT and image-guidance studies. Three-dimensional (3D) color trajectory maps of white-matter tracts adjacent to the lesions were reconstructed. The usefulness of tractography in perioperative planning was graded on a scale of 1 to 4. The postoperative outcomes were studied in relation to the pattern of tract involvement. The lesions included brain tumors in 40 patients, vascular malformations in five patients and other lesions in five patients. An awake craniotomy was performed in 19 patients. The tracts were only displaced in 72% of patients, completely infiltrated in 14% and had a combined pattern in 14%. DTT significantly altered the planning (score >= 3) in 62% of patients. Patients with pure displacement had the best outcome, while those with infiltration had a poorer outcome. We conclude that tractography improves surgical safety and aids prognostication in surgery of patients with eloquent cortex lesions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-We aimed to determine the prevalence of acute brain infarcts using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
Methods-We collected data on consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH admitted to our institution between August 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008 and in whom DWI was performed within 28 days of admission. Patients with hemorrhage attributable to trauma, tumor, aneurysm, vascular malformation, and hemorrhagic conversion of arterial or venous infarction were excluded. Restricted diffusion within, contiguous with, or immediately neighboring the hematoma or chronic infarcts was not considered abnormal. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated potential predictors of DWI abnormality including clinical and radiographic characteristics and treatments. A probability value < 0.05 was considered significant in the final model.; Results-Among 118 spontaneous ICH patients (mean 59.6 years, 47.5% male, and 31.4% white) who also underwent MRI, DWI abnormality was observed in 22.9%. The majority of infarcts were small (median volume 0.25 mL), subcortical (70.4%), and subclinical (88.9%). Factors independently associated with DWI abnormality were prior ischemic stroke (P = 0.002), MAP lowering by >= 40% (P = 0.004), and craniotomy for ICH evacuation (P = 0.001).; Conclusion-We found that acute brain infarction is relatively common after acute spontaneous ICH. Several factors, including aggressive blood pressure lowering, may be associated with acute ischemic infarcts after ICH. These preliminary findings require further prospective study.

N2  -  Purpose: The diffusion model can be transformed into a multicompartment model by means of multi-b factor diffusion-weighted sequences. We adapted a method of statistical analysis of these images and evaluated its performance to distinguish tumor-infiltrated edema from vasogenic edema.
Materials and Methods: Forty-nine patients with infiltrating tumors (38 patients: low to high-grade gliomas) or vasogenic edema (11 patients: metastases, abscess, extra-axial lesions) were studied by multi-b factor diffusion-weighted imaging. Comparison of histological results and morphological and perfusion MRI defined 69 characteristic volumes of interest in the peritumoral edema of 69 distinct infiltrating lesions (40) or lesions inducing vasogenic edema (29).; Results: The factorial analysis had a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.6% between tumor-infiltrated and vasogenic edema. Simplified interpretation confined to values of the high and mean diffusivity compartments had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 89.2% between strictly tumor-infiltrated edema and vasogenic edema with the advantage of simplified interpretation based on two-color parametric mapping.; Conclusion: Discrimination between tumor-infiltrated edema and vasogenic edema can be achieved by means of a 90-s multi-b factor diffusion-weighted sequence and factorial analysis. Simplified visual and quantitative interpretation of the results should also allow integration of multi-b factor analysis into routine neuroradiology practice.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate the signal characteristics of the abscess wall and tumor wall on diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted images and thus to evaluate the feasibility of using combined MR diffusion and perfusion imaging to differentiate pyogenic cerebral abscess from infected brain tumor. The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor was significantly hyperintense relative to that of cerebral abscess wall on both diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps.
Sixteen patients who had cerebral masses with large cystic or necrotic cavities were imaged to generate diffusion-weighted images and regional cerebral blood volume maps using single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) pulse sequences. Apart from qualitative analysis, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) as well as regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios were calculated from the abscess wall and peripheral tumor wall and comparison was made by using Student's t-test. The tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor had significantly lower ADCs relative to those of the abscess wall (P<0.005) and thus appeared relatively hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images. The mean rCBV ratio relative to normal white matter (2.90Â±0.62) of the peripheral tumor wall of various types of cystic or necrotic brain tumor were significantly larger than the mean rCBV ratio (0.45Â±0.11) of the pyogenic cerebral abscess wall (P<0.001) by Student's t-test. It is concluded that the combined MR diffusion and perfusion imaging might be capable of differentiating an infected brain tumor from a pyogenic cerebral abscess. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  -  Motor deficit severity and the potential for recovery in patients with brain injury depend on the integrity of descending corticofugal projections. Clinical assessment of these conditions following subtotal brain trauma requires a comprehensive understanding of the anatomical structures involved in the lesion as well as those structures that are spared. To assist in this endeavor, we investigated motor fiber organization in the crus cerebri of the cerebral peduncle (ccCP) in the rhesus monkey. Fibers originating from the arm representations of the primary (M1), supplementary (M2), rostral cingulate (M3), caudal cingulate (M4), dorsolateral pre- (LPMCd) and ventrolateral pre- (LPMCv) motor cortices were studied. The projections from the frontal and cingulate motor cortices formed descending longitudinal bundles that occupied the medial three-fifths of the ccCP at superior and middle levels. Although considerable overlap characterized these corticofugal projections, a general topography was discernable. Fibers from M1 and M4 occupied the central subsector of the ccCP, and fibers from M3 resided medially. The main distribution of LPMCd, LPMCv, and M2 fibers occupied the centromedial region and overlapped extensively. Progressing inferiorly, all fiber bundles in the central and centromedial sectors gradually extended medially, and overlap increased. A common location of fiber passage occurred at the midbrain-pontine isthmus where all of the fiber bundles overlapped. Our findings indicate that the widespread distribution of corticofugal motor projections may account for the favorable levels of motor recovery that accompany subtotal midbrain injury. At superior and mid-levels of the ccCP anteromedial lesions may disrupt projections from M3, whereas anterolateral lesions may disrupt projections from M1 and M4. Fibers from M2, LPMCv, and LPMCd may be compromised to some degree in both situations. The compact and commixed nature of motor fiber organization at inferior levels and the midbrain-pontine isthmus suggests a vulnerable region of passage for comprehensive disruption of frontal and cingulate corticofugal projection fibers.

N2  -  The inability of structural MRI to accurately measure tumor response to therapy complicates care management for patients with gliomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of several noninvasive functional and molecular MRI biomarkers for the assessment of glioma response to radiotherapy.
Fourteen U87 tumor-bearing rats were irradiated using a small-animal radiation research platform (40 or 20 Gy), and 6 rats were used as controls. MRI was performed on a 4.7 T animal scanner, preradiation treatment, as well as at 3, 6, 9, and 14 days postradiation. Image features of the tumors, as well as tumor volumes and animal survival, were quantitatively compared.; Structural MRI showed that all irradiated tumors still grew in size during the initial days postradiation. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tumors increased significantly postradiation (40 and 20 Gy), except at day 3 postradiation, compared with preradiation. The tumor blood flow decreased significantly postradiation (40 and 20 Gy), but the relative blood flow (tumor vs contralateral) did not show a significant change at most time points postradiation. The amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) signals of the tumor decreased significantly at all time points postradiation (40 Gy), and also at day 9 postradiation (20 Gy). The blood flow and APTw maps demonstrated tumor features that were similar to those seen on gadolinium-enhanced T-1-weighted images.; Tumor ADC, blood flow, and APTw were all useful imaging biomarkers by which to predict glioma response to radiotherapy. The APTw signal was most promising for early response assessment in this model.

N2  -  Background: Differentiation of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs) is an important clinical problem because treatment strategies vary greatly. This study was performed to investigate the potential diagnostic value of incoherent intravoxel motion imaging (IVIM) to distinguish HGG from LGG by meta-analysis.
Methods: A computerized search of the literature was performed using the free-access PubMed database, Web of Science, and Chinese biomedical database, and relevant articles until September 18, 2018 that used IVIM to distinguish HGG from LGG were included. All analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata. Mean difference (MD) at 95% confidence interval (CI) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusion coefficient value (D), perfusion fraction value (f), and perfusion coefficient value (D*) were summarized.; Results: Nine studies were used for general data pooling. In the tumor parenchyma (TP) regions, subgroup analysis revealed D* in HGG is higher than in LGG (MD=1.19, P=.002), and D in HGG is lower than in LGG (MD=-1.06, P=.001). However, no significant difference in f (MD=0.89, P=.056) was detected between HGG and LGG. In the white matter regions, HGG had higher D* (MD= 0.76, P=.04) compared with LGG, while no marked differences between the D value (P=.07) and f (P=.09) values.; Conclusion: The present meta-analysis shows that the ADC, D, and D* values derived from IVIM may be useful in differentiating HGG from LGG. Considering the small sample of this study, we need to be cautious when interpreting the results of this study. Other prospective and large-sample randomized controlled trials were needed to establish the value of IVIM in differentiating HGG from LGG.

T2  -  WORLD NEUROSURGERY

N2  -  The fundamental role of technological instruments in contemporary Neurosurgery is undisputed, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents one of the best examples. The use of a modern high-field magnet and the possibility to match the MRI with an operative microscope and an integrated neuronavigation system has led to successful results in the surgical treatment of different diseases. At our institute, we have performed surgery routinely with the aid of intraoperative MRI over the last 15 years. The aim of this article is to report our experience in the management of neurovascular lesions with the use of this device. We experienced that intraoperative MRI enhanced the surgical experience, leading to an improved postoperative outcome in the treatment of different lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, intracranial cavernous angiomas, and intracranial aneurysms. There are several advantages provided by the use of intraoperative MRI. The use of intraoperative MRI coupled with the planning station and the neuronavigation system allows one to obtain preoperative 3-dimensional reconstructions of the vessels, which aids the definition of the anatomy of each neurovascular lesion. Furthermore, the possibility performing an intraoperative scan allows a comparison with preoperative images and, subsequently, the updating of the surgical strategy. Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging can detect possible territorial ischemia that would be amenable to intensive treatment. Although increased costs, increased surgical times, increased anesthesiology times, and the possible increased risk of surgical infection may represent some major limitation, the use of intraoperative MRI-equipped operative theaters with integrated neuronavigation systems can prove extremely helpful in the management of neurovascular conditions.

N2  -  Purpose Presurgical functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI tractography (dMRI tractography) are widely employed to delineate eloquent brain regions and their connections prior to brain tumor resection in adults. However, such studies are harder to perform in children, resulting in suboptimal neurosurgical care in pediatric brain tumor surgery as compared to adults. Thus, our objective was to assess the feasibility and the influence of presurgical advanced MR imaging on neurosurgical care in pediatric brain tumor surgery.
Methods Retrospective analyses of 31 presurgical fMRIdMRI tractography studies were performed in children with low-grade tumors near eloquent brain regions at our site between 2005 and 2017.; Results In only 331 cases, imaging results were not interpretable (10%). All 28 successful imaging sessions were used for neurosurgical risk assessment. Based on this, surgery was canceled in 228 patients, and intention to treat was changed in 528 patients. In 428 cases, the surgical approach was changed and in 1028, electrode placement for intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was guided by imaging results. Gross total resection (G(T)R) was planned in 2128 cases and could be achieved in 1521 (71%). Despite highly eloquent tumor location, only four children suffered from a mild permanent neurological deficit after the operation.; Conclusions We demonstrate that presurgical fMRIdMRI tractography can have a profound impact on pediatric brain tumor management, optimizing preoperative risk-assessment and pre- as well as intraoperative decision-making. We believe that these tools should be offered to children suffering from eloquent brain tumors as part of a comprehensive operative work-up.

N2  -  An interleaved echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique is presented for the rapid acquisition of isotropic diffusion-weighted images of stroke patients. Sixteen isotropic diffusion-weighted images at three b values are acquired in less than 3 min. A spiral navigator echo is used to measure the constant and linear phase shifts across the head in both the x and y directions which result from motion during the isotropic diffusion-sensitizing gradients. The measured k-space errors are corrected during a gridding reconstruction. The gridding kernel has a constant width in k(x),and a variable width in k(y) which eliminates variable data-density ghosts. The resulting isotropic diffusion-weighted images have excellent lesion-to-normal brain contrast, very good spatial resolution, and little sensitivity to susceptibility effects in the base of the brain. Examples of diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps from several stroke patients are shown.

N2  -  BackgroundMelioidosis is a tropical disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (B. pseudomallei). It can infect any organ system and lead to multiple abscesses. A few studies reported that central nervous system (CNS) is also involved.We present a diabetic patient with multi-systemic melioidosis that affected the CNS, thorax, and spleen. The aim was to study the clinical and radiological features of melioidosis and enhance understanding of the disease.Case presentationA 38-year-old male presented with cough and expectoration mixed with blood for several days. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a patchy opacity in his left lung, and multiple low-density lesions in his spleen. After 10days of antibiotics treatment, his clinical symptoms improved and he was discharged from the hospital. But 8months later, the patient experienced sudden onset of left limb weakness and seizure and was re-admitted to the hospital. Brain CT indicated a low-density lesion over the right frontal lobe, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a well-enhanced lobulated lesion with multiple diffusion restriction areas in the lesion. He had a neuronavigation-guided open surgery but no malignancy was found. B. pseudomallei was cultured from the operative samples. After 4months of systemic and intraventricular antibiotic administration treatment, he recovered complete consciousness with left hemiparesis.ConclusionsMulti-systemic melioidosis may present atypical clinical, neurological, and radiological manifestations. It is extremely important to accurately diagnose before treatment is selected. CNS melioidosis in early stage manifests similar symptoms to malignancy or stroke. It might mislead to a false diagnose. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can help in differentiate abscesses from cystic tumours.

N2  -  Purpose Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging is a potential noninvasive technique for the diagnosis of brain tumors. However, perfusion-related parameter mapping is a persistent problem. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the IVIM parameter mapping of brain tumors using Bayesian fitting and low b-values. Methods Bayesian shrinkage prior (BSP) fitting method and different low b-value distributions were used to estimate IVIM parameters (diffusionD, pseudo-diffusionD*, and perfusion fractionF). The results were compared to those obtained by least squares (LSQ) on both simulated andin vivobrain data. Relative error (RE) and reproducibility were used to evaluate the results. The differences of IVIM parameters between brain tumor and normal regions were compared and used to assess the performance of Bayesian fitting in the IVIM application of brain tumor. Results In tumor regions, the value ofD*tended to be decreased when the number of low b-values was insufficient, especially with LSQ. BSP required less low b-values than LSQ for the correct estimation of perfusion parameters of brain tumors. The IVIM parameter maps of brain tumors yielded by BSP had smaller variability, lower RE, and higher reproducibility with respect to those obtained by LSQ. Obvious differences were observed between tumor and normal regions in parametersD(P < 0.05) andF(P < 0.001), especiallyF. BSP generated fewer outliers than LSQ, and distinguished better tumors from normal regions in parameterF. Conclusions Intravoxel incoherent motion parameters clearly allow brain tumors to be differentiated from normal regions. Bayesian fitting yields robust IVIM parameter mapping with fewer outliers and requires less low b-values than LSQ for the parameter estimation.

N2  -  Rationale:Bilateral thalamic glioma is extremely rare and characterized by strictly limited involvement of bilateral thalami. To investigate its clinical and neuroimaging features, we herein reported a rare case of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) involving both thalami and the brainstem and reviewed the literature.Patient concerns:A-33-year-old Chinese woman was referred to our department owing to persistent headache and nausea and vomiting. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment and positive Kernig sign.Diagnosis:Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated asymmetrical and swollen lesions involving both thalami, midbrain and pontine tegmentum, without restricted diffusion or enhancement. On day 7 after admission, she was transferred to the department of neurosurgery and underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy of the right thalamic lesion. Histopathological features and immunohistochemistry were consistent with AA, IDH wild-type, World Health Organization grade III.Interventions:She was administrated with mannitol and glycerin fructose for decreasing intracranial pressure.Outcomes:In spite of receiving chemotherapy, she died on 2-month after her initial diagnosis.Lessons:AA involving in both thalami and brainstem is a rare entity with poor prognosis. The clinicians and radiologists should deepen their awareness of the specific MRI feature of bilateral thalamic involvement. When MRI alone is insufficient, the utility of stereotactic biopsy is essential for making a definitive diagnosis.

N2  -  Background Mapping functional areas of the brain is important for planning tumour resections. With the increased use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for presurgical planning, there is a need to validate that fMRI activation mapping is consistent with the mapping obtained during surgery using direct electrocortical stimulation (DECS).
Methods A quantitative comparison of DECS and fMRI mapping techniques was performed, using a patient-specific conductivity model to find the current distribution resulting from each stimulation site. The resulting DECS stimulation map was compared to the fMRI activation map, using the maximal Dice similarity coefficient (MDSC).; Results Our results show some agreement between these two mapping techniques - the stimulation site with the largest MOSC was the only site that demonstrated intra-operative effect.; Conclusions There is a substantial effort to improve the techniques used to map functional areas, particularly using fMRI. It seems likely that fMRI will eventually provide a valid non-invasive means for functional mapping. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Introduction: The use of integrated pre- and intraoperative imaging may be useful when resecting brain lesions in close proximity to eloquent areas, such as the primary motor cortex and language cortices.
Case Report: A 32-year-old woman with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) located in the primary motor cortex underwent surgery using functional neuronavigation. Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRl) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were used for preoperative mapping of primary motor areas and the corticospinal tracts, respectively. The BOLD fMRI activations and DTT tractograms were integrated into the neuronavigation system and visualized intraoperatively throughout the operation. Furthermore, stereoscopic visualizations of the angioarchitecture based on 3D MRI angiograms were used to rehearse the surgical approach to the feeder vessels. Finally, intraoperative ultrasound was used to locate and clip the feeding vessels.; Conclusion: The AVM was carefully resected with the aid of the above-mentioned imaging techniques, and the intuitive usefulness of the techniques was further substantiated by the rewarding postoperative Outcome.

N2  -  Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging is an MRI perfusion technique that uses a diffusion-weighted sequence with multiple b values and a bi-compartmental signal model to measure the so-called pseudo-diffusion of blood caused by its passage through the microvascular network. The goal of the current study was to assess the feasibility of IVIM perfusion fraction imaging in patients with acute stroke.
Images were collected in 17 patients with acute stroke. Exclusion criteria were onset of symptoms to imaging > 5 days, hemorrhagic transformation, infratentorial lesions, small lesions < 0.5 cm in minimal diameter and hemodynamic instability. IVIM imaging was performed at 3 T, using a standard spin-echo Stejskal-Tanner pulsed gradients diffusion-weighted sequence, using 16 b values from 0 to 900 smm(2). Image quality was assessed by two radiologists, and quantitative analysis was performed in regions of interest placed in the stroke area, defined by thresholding the apparent diffusion coefficient maps, as well as in the contralateral region.; IVIM perfusion fraction maps showed an area of decreased perfusion fraction f in the region of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient. Quantitative analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in both IVIM perfusion fraction f (0.026 +- 0.019 vs. 0.056 +- 0.025, p = 2.2 center dot 10(-6)) and diffusion coefficient D compared with the contralateral side (3.9 A +- 0.79 A center dot 10(-4) vs. 7.5 A +- 0.86 A center dot 10(-4) mm(2)s, p = 1.3 A center dot 10(-20)).; IVIM perfusion fraction imaging is feasible in acute stroke. IVIM perfusion fraction is significantly reduced in the visible infarct. Further studies should evaluate the potential for IVIM to predict clinical outcome and treatment response.

N2  -  Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the responses of human glioma tumor xenografts to a single fraction of radiation, where a change in radiosensitivity was induced by use of a suture-based ligature.
Methods: Ischemia was induced by use of a suture-based ligature. Six mice were treated with 800 cGy of 200 kVp x rays while the ligature was applied. An additional six mice had the ligature applied for the same length of time but were not irradiated. Quantitative maps of each tumor were produced of water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transverse relaxation time (T2). Mice were imaged before and at multiple points after treatment. Volumetric, ADC, and T2 responses of the ligated groups were compared to previously measured responses of the same tumor model to the same radiation treatment, as well as those from an untreated control group.; Results: Application of the ligature without irradiation did not affect tumor ADC values, but did produce a temporary decrease in tumor T2 values. Average tumor T2 was reduced by 6.2% 24 h after the ligature was applied. Average tumor ADC increased by 9.6% 7 days after irradiation with a ligature applied. This response was significantly less than that observed in the same tumor model when no ligature is present (21.8% at 7 days after irradiation).; Conclusions: These observations indicate that the response of ADC to radiation therapy is not determined entirely by physical dose deposition, but at least in part by radiosensitivity and resultant biological response.

N2  -  Objective and Importance: Delineation of cerebral white matter tracts using MR tractography adds essential information for planning intracranial surgery. Integrating tractography with intraoperative neuronavigation may reduce the likelihood of new neurological deficits after surgery done to remove tumors adjacent to the projection fibers of eloquent cortex. We report the utility of such integration for the resection of deep (paraventricular) tumors. Clinical Presentation: A 67-year-old male with malignant melanoma underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for a single metastasis within the paraventricular white matter of the right frontal lobe near the corticospinal tract. The lesion doubled in size within 12 months of radiotherapy. Surgical extirpation was performed aided by intraoperative neuronavigation. Technique: MR images of the brain including MR tractography and post-contrast T-1-weighted sequences were acquired and imported into a neuronavigational workstation. Asymmetric fusion of contrast-enhanced images and tractography was employed to assist in preservation of the integrity of critical white matter tracts during the surgical procedure. Conclusion: Inclusion of tractography in standard imaging protocols for neuronavigational systems may increase the safety of neurosurgical intervention near white matter tracts, including deep areas adjacent to the ventricles.

N2  -  The relation of contrast-enhanced transverse relaxation rates R-2* and R-2 provides in vivo mapping of the mean caliber of cerebral vessels. This technique is referred to as vessel size imaging (VSI). Here a quantitative assessment of the vessel caliber in brain tumor patients is presented. The obtained mean vessel size shows sensitivity to the tumor type. A theoretical analysis is given to elucidate the morphological information content of VSI in the context of vessel architecture. The simplification of the theory underlying the data processing results in a systematic overestimation of the vessel caliber. An increase in the magnetic susceptibility of the contrast agent allows for quantitatively more accurate measurements. Quantitative VSI must include measurements of the regional diffusion coefficient and absolute determination of the regional cerebral blood volume.

N2  -  Background. MRI may provide insights into longitudinal responses in the diffusivity and vascular function of the irradiated normal-appearing brain following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases. Methods. Forty patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (N = 26) and malignant melanoma (N = 14) received SRS (15-25 Gy). Longitudinal MRI was performed pre-SRS and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months post-SRS. Measures of tissue diffusivity and vascularity were assessed by diffusion-weighted and perfusion MRI, respectively. All maps were normalized to white matter receiving less than 1 Gy. Longitudinal responses were assessed in normal-appearing brain, excluding tumor and edema, in the LowDose (1-10 Gy) and HighDose (>10 Gy) regions.The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was recorded pre-SRS. Results. Following SRS, the diffusivity in the LowDose region increased continuously for 1 year (105.1% +/- 6.2%; P <.001), before reversing toward pre-SRS levels at 18 months. Transient reductions in microvascular cerebral blood volume (P <.05), blood flow (P <.05), and vessel densities (P <.05) were observed in LowDose at 6-9 months post-SRS. Correspondingly, vessel calibers in LowDose transiently increased at 3-9 months (P <.01). The responses in HighDose displayed similar trends as in LowDose, but with larger interpatient variations. Vascular responses-followed pre-SRS ECOG status. Conclusions. Our results imply that even low doses of radiation to normal-appearing brain following cerebral SRS induce increased diffusivity and reduced vascular function for up until 18 months. In particular, the vascular responses indicate the reduced ability of the normal-appearing brain tissue to form new capillaries. Assessing the potential long-term neurologic effects of SRS on the normal-appearing brain is warranted.

T2  -  FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY

N2  -  The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell's digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2. .

N2  -  Background and purpose: Standard treatment of high grade gliomas includes gross tumour resection followed by radio(chemo)therapy. Radiotherapy inevitably leads to irradiation of normal brain tissue. The goal of this prospective, longitudinal study was to use MRI to quantify normal appearing white and grey matter changes following radiation treatment as a function of dose and time after radiotherapy.
Materials and methods: Pre-radiotherapy (proton or photon therapy) MRI and follow-up MRIs collected in 3 monthly intervals thereafter were analysed for 22 glioma patients and included diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative T1, T2* and proton density mapping. Abnormal tissue was excluded from analysis. MR signal changes were quantified within different dose bin regions for grey and white matter and subsequently for whole brain white matter.; Results: We found significant reductions in mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity and T2* in normal appearing white matter regions receiving a radiation dose as low as 10-20 Gy within the observational period of up to 18 months. The magnitude of these changes increased with the received radiation dose and progressed with time after radiotherapy. Whole brain white matter also showed a significant reduction in radial diffusivity as a function of radiation dose and time after radiotherapy. No significant changes were observed in grey matter.; Conclusion: Diffusion tensor imaging and T2* imaging revealed normal appearing white matter changes following radiation treatment. The changes were dose dependant and progressed over time. Further work is needed to understand the underlying tissue changes and to correlate the observed diffusion changes with late brain malfunctions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  -  DIAGNOSTICS

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging modality for identifying inflammatory and/or demyelinating lesions, which is critical for a clinical diagnosis of MS and evaluating drug responses. There are many unique means of probing brain tissue status, including conventional T1 and T2 weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI), T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), magnetization transfer, myelin water fraction, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), phase-sensitive inversion recovery and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), but no study has combined all of these modalities into a single well-controlled investigation. The goals of this study were to: compare different MRI measures for lesion visualization and quantification; evaluate the repeatability of various imaging methods in healthy controls; compare quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) with myelin water fraction; measure short-term longitudinal changes in the white matter of MS patients and map out the tissue properties of the white matter hyperintensities using STAGE (strategically acquired gradient echo imaging). Additionally, the outcomes of this study were anticipated to aid in the choice of an efficient imaging protocol reducing redundancy of information and alleviating patient burden. Of all the sequences used, T2 FLAIR and T2WI showed the most lesions. To differentiate the putative demyelinating lesions from inflammatory lesions, the fusion of SWI and T2 FLAIR was used. Our study suggests that a practical and efficient imaging protocol combining T2 FLAIR, T1WI and STAGE (with SWI and QSM) can be used to rapidly image MS patients to both find lesions and study the demyelinating and inflammatory characteristics of the lesions.

T2  -  BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY

N2  -  It remains unknown which factors influence how brain disconnectivity derived from White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) lesions leads to psychomotor speed dysfunction, one of the earliest and most common cognitive manifestations in the cerebral Small Vessel Disease (cSVD) population. While the burden of WMH has been strongly linked to psychomotor speed performance, the effect that different locations and volumes of WMH may have on cSVD-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore (1) whether global WMH, deep WMH (DWMH), and periventricular (PVWMH) volumes display different psychomotor speed associations; (2) whether tract-specific WMH volume shows stronger cognitive associations compared with global measures of WMH volume; (3) whether specific patterns of WMH location lead to different degrees of disconnectivity. Using the BCBToolkit, we investigated which pattern of distribution and which locations of WMH lesion result in impaired psychomotor speed in a well-characterized sample (n = 195) of cSVD patients without dementia. Two key findings emerge from our study. First, global (and not tract-specific) measures of WMH volume were associated with psychomotor speed performance. Second, disconnection maps revealed the involvement of callosal tracts, association and projection fibers, and frontal and parietal cortical brain areas related to psychomotor speed, while the lesion location influenced such associations. In conclusion, psychomotor deficits are affected differently by WMH burden and topographic distribution through brain disconnection in non-demented cSVD patients.

N2  -  Introduction: White matter tracts can be observed using tractograms generated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, the dependence of these white matter tract images on subjective variables, including how seed points are placed and the preferred level of fractional anisotropy, introduces interobserver inconsistency and potential lack of reliability. We propose that color-coded maps (CCM) generated from DTI can be a preferred method for the visualization of important white matter tracts, circumventing bias in preoperative brain tumor resection planning. Methods: DTI was acquired retrospectively in 25 patients with brain tumors. Lesions included 15 tumors of glial origin, 9 metastatic tumors, 2 meningiomas, and 1 cavernous angioma. Tractograms of the pyramidal tract and/or optic radiations, based on tumor location, were created by marking seed regions of interest using known anatomical locations. We compared the degree of tract involvement and white matter alteration between CCMs and tractograms. Neurological outcomes were obtained from chart reviews. Results: The pyramidal tract was evaluated in 20/25 patients, the visual tracts were evaluated in 10/25, and both tracts were evaluated in 5/25. In 19/25 studies, the same patterns of white matter alternations were found between the CCMs and tractograms. In the 6 patients where patterns differed, 2 tractograms were not useful in determining pattern alteration; in the remaining 4/6, no practical difference was seen in comparing the studies. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Thirteen patients were neurologically improved or remained intact after intervention. In these, 10 of the 13 patients showed tumor-induced white matter tract displacement on CCM. Twelve patients had no improvement of their preoperative deficit. In 9 of these 12 patients, CCM showed white matter disruption. Conclusion: CCMs provide a convenient, practical, and objective method of visualizing white matter tracts, obviating the need for potentially subjective and time-consuming tractography. CCMs are at least as reliable as tractograms in predicting neurological outcomes after neurosurgical intervention.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-New diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions are common in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The pathophysiology of these new lesions is unclear. We differentiated new DWI lesions outside the area of initial hypoperfusion from those confined to the area of initial hypoperfusion.
Methods-Patients with acute stroke underwent 3 MRI examinations: on admission, on the next day, and 4 to 7 days after symptom onset. Patients were included if a perfusion deficit was present on the initial scan. Lesions on DWI images were delineated manually. Coregistered DWI images were analyzed visually for new hyperintensities. In reference to the perfusion maps (mean transit time), patients were classified as having "outside lesions" if new DWI lesions were outside or both outside and inside the area of the initial perfusion deficit or "inside lesions" if new DWI lesions were completely inside.; Results-We enrolled 164 patients. Thirty-eight patients (23%) had outside lesions and 34 patients (21%) had inside lesions. In multivariable regression analysis, new outside lesions were significantly associated with symptomatic carotid stenosis, multiple index lesions pattern, and high low-density lipoprotein levels. New inside lesions were significantly associated with (spontaneous or thrombolytic) vessel recanalization, multiple index lesions pattern, and low low-density lipoprotein levels.; Conclusion-Outside and inside lesions represent different pathophysiological entities. More specifically patients with outside lesions may have an increased risk for subsequent cerebrovascular events. (Stroke. 2012; 43:2654-2658.)

N2  -  Introduction 11 C-Methionine (MET) PET and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI are commonly used for evaluation of gliomas. We assessed the correlation between MET uptake and diffusion restriction measured on DW MRI in glioma.
Materials and methods Thirty-one patients with gliomas, who were initially examined with MET PET and DW MRI, were enrolled retrospectively. MET PET and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images were coregistered to each other, using rigid-body transformation. Tumor-to-normal count density ratio of the cortex (TNR) and normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC) value were measured for each voxel on the MET PET and ADC map. The maximum TNR (TNRmax) and minimum nADC (nADC(min)) were obtained for each tumor. Correlations between those parameters were evaluated.; Results The TNRmax and nADC(min) values of a glioma were significantly correlated (r= -0.42). TNRmax and nADC(min) were significantly correlated with glioma grades. Furthermore, TNRmax and nADC(min) showed a trend for correlation with the Ki-67 index. We analyzed the correlation between voxel-based TNR and ADC within a tumor and observed no correlation between them. Regions with high MET uptake did not correspond with regions with low nADC.; Conclusion We found a negative correlation between TNRmax and nADC(min) for each glioma; however, MET uptake and ADC within a tumor were independent of each other and were heterogeneous. The two parameters represent different biological features; thus, as a comprehensive approach, MET PET and DW MRI might have a complementary role in the characterization of gliomas.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: Diffusion tensor imaging has been used to characterize tumor heterogeneity and invasion in human glioblastoma. Recently, higher order diffusion tensors have been proposed as solutions to errors associated with diffusion tensor imaging estimates of complex microstructures. The purpose of the current study was to examine higher order diffusion characteristics in human glioblastoma prior to surgical resection using the fourth-order diffusion tensor model.
Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma participated in the study. Diffusion-weighted images were collected in 21 directions. The second-order (traditional) and fourth-order diffusion tensors were calculated and compared in regions of contrast enhancement, T2 signal abnormality, and normal-appearing white matter.; Results: Orientation distribution functions were strikingly different between the two tensor models, particularly in regions with tumor heterogeneity andor regions of suspected tumor invasion. Image contrast was significantly higher in fourth-order scalar measures compared to second-order scalars. Results of particular eigenvalues and scalars using the fourth-order tensor showed differences between T2 abnormal regions and contrast enhancement, whereas second-order eigenvalues and scalars did not show differences. This suggests that higher order diffusion images could potentially be more sensitive to tumor invasion.; Conclusions: These results suggest that the fourth-order diffusion tensor has the ability to add value to second-order (traditional) diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of glioblastoma.

N2  -  Background: Treatment with bevacizumab is associated with substantial radiologic response in patients with glioblastoma ( GB). However, following this initial response, changes in T2-weighted MRI signal may develop, suggesting an infiltrative pattern of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to differentiate between vasogenic-edema versus tumor-infiltrative area in GB patients.
Methods and materials: Fourteen patients with GB were longitudinally scanned, before and during intravenous bevacizumab therapy (5110 mgkg every 2-weeks). A total of 40 MR scans including conventional, diffusion, dynamic susceptibility contrast, dynamic contrast enhancement imaging, and MR-spectroscopy (MRS) were analyzed. Classification of non-enhancing fluid-attenuation-inversion-recovery (FLAIR) area was performed based on mean diffusivity, cerebral blood volume and flow maps, and further characterized using multiple MRI parameters.; Results: The non-enhancing FLAIR lesion area was classified into: vasogenic-edema, characterized by reduced perfusion and increased FLAIR values; or tumor-infiltrative area, characterized by increased perfusion. Tumor-infiltrative area demonstrated a higher malignant pattern on MRS compared to areas of vasogenic-edema. Substantial reductions of the enhanced T-1 -weighted (58 +- 10%) and hyperintense FLAIR (53 +- 9%) lesion volumes were detected mainly during the first weeks of therapy, with a shift to an infiltrative pattern of tumor progression thereafter, as detected by an increase in tumor-infiltrative area in the majority of patients, which correlated with progression-free survival (week 8: r = 0.86, p = 0.003, week 16: r= 0.99, p = 0.001).; Conclusion: Characterization of non-enhancing hyperintense FLAIR lesion area in GB patients can provide an MR-based biomarker, indicating a shift to an infiltrative progression pattern, and may improve therapy response assessment in patients following bevacizumab therapy.

N2  -  Objectives: One of the most frequent cerebral lesions in mitochondrial disorders(MIDs) on imaging is the stroke-like lesion(SLL) clinically manifesting as stroke-like episode (SLE, metabolic stroke). This review aims at discussing recent advances concerning the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of SLLs.
Methods: Systematic literature review using appropriate search terms.; Results: SLLs are the hallmark of MELAS but occasionally occur in other MIDs. SLLs are best identified on multimodal, cerebral MRI. SLLs may present as uni-multilocular, symmetricasymmetric, corticalsubcortical, supra-infratentorial condition, initially resembling a cytotoxic edema and later a vasogenic edema, or a variable mix between them. SLLs run through an acute and a chronic stage. The acute stage is characterised by a progressively expanding lesion over days, weeks, or months, showing up as increasing hyperintensity on T2FLAIR, DWI, and PWI and by hyperperfusion, that does not conform to a vascular territory. ADC maps are initially hypointens to become hyperintens during the course. More rarely, a variable mixture of hyper- and hypointensities may be found. The chronic stage is characterised by hypoperfusion, gadolinium enhancement, and regression of hyperintensities to various endpoints. SLLs originate from an initial cortical lesion due to focal metabolic breakdown, which either remains stable or expands within the cortex or to subcortical areas. Some SLLs show spontaneous reversibility (fleeing cortical lesions) suggesting that neuronalglial damage does not reach the threshold of irreversible cell death.; Conclusions: SLLs are a unique feature of various MIDs in particular MELAS. SLLs are dynamic and change their appearance over time. SLLs are accessible to treatment.

N2  -  Background : Giant intracerebral tuberculomas are rare lesions but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracranial space -occupying lesion in an endemic region. Objective: The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of giant intracerebral tuberculomas to improve the diagnostic precision. Material and Methods : The clinical and MRI findings of 22 patients of giant intracerebral tuberculoma were analyzed retrospectively. For the statistical analysis independent sample Student t -test was used. Results: For 22 patients included in this sample the giant intracerebral tuberculoma was of size more than 2.5cm. The majority of the giant tuberculomas (19 patients (86.4%))was located in the supratentorial area.T2weighted hypointense core of giant tuberculoma was observed in 12 patients (54.5%) and T1 hyperintensities were observed in peripheral (wall) of the giant tuberculoma in 14 patients (63.6%). The mean ADC value of the peripheral (wall) of the giant tuberculoma was 1.034 +/- 0.466[SD] x 10( -3) mm(2) /s and the core was 0.994 +/- 0.455[SD] x 10( -3) mm( 2) /s with a statistically significant difference (p -value <0.0005) in between. MR spectroscopy showed raised lipid peak at 0.9 to 1.33 ppm in 10 patients (45.5%),raised lipid -lactate peak in 12 patients (54.5%),raised Choline/Cr ratio more than 1.2 in 14 patients(63.6%) and Choline/Cr ratio less than 1.2 in 5 patients (22.7%). Associated involvement of lung was observed in the 6patients (27.3%), cervical lymph node in 1 patient (4.5%) and spine in 1patient (4.5%). Conclusions: MRI plays a vital role in distinguishing giant intracerebral tuberculomas from other intracranial space -occupying lesions, thereby allows the early institution of anti -tubercular treatment (ATT), decreased patient morbidity, mortality, and prevents unnecessary neurosurgical excision.

N2  -  Multiple Sclerosis patients' clinical symptoms do not correlate strongly with structural assessment done with traditional magnetic resonance images. However, its diagnosis and evaluation of the disease's progression are based on a combination of this imaging analysis complemented with clinical examination. Therefore, other biomarkers are necessary to better understand the disease. In this paper, we capitalize on machine learning techniques to classify relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and healthy volunteers based on machine learning techniques, and to identify relevant brain areas and connectivity measures for characterizing patients. To this end, we acquired magnetic resonance imaging data from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and healthy subjects. Fractional anisotropy maps, structural and functional connectivity were extracted from the scans. Each of them were used as separate input features to construct support vector machine classifiers. A fourth input feature was created by combining structural and functional connectivity. Patients were divided in two groups according to their degree of disability and, together with the control group, three group pairs were formed for comparison. Twelve separate classifiers were built from the combination of these four input features and three group pairs. The classifiers were able to distinguish between patients and healthy subjects, reaching accuracy levels as high as 89% +/- 2%. In contrast, the performance was noticeably lower when comparing the two groups of patients with different levels of disability, reaching levels below 63% +/- 5%. The brain regions that contributed the most to the classification were the right occipital, left frontal orbital, medial frontal cortices and lingual gyrus. The developed classifiers based on MRI data were able to distinguish multiple sclerosis patients and healthy subjects reliably. Moreover, the resulting classification models identified brain regions, and functional and structural connections relevant for better understanding of the disease.

N2  -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective and well tolerated treatment for selected brain metastases; however, local recurrence still occurs. We investigated the use of diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) as an adjunct for SRS treatment planning in brain metastases. Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing complete surgical resection of a solitary brain metastasis underwent image analysis retrospectively. SRS treatment plans were generated based on standard 3D post-contrast T1-weighted sequences at 1.5T and then separately using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in a blinded fashion. Control scans immediately post operation confirmed complete tumour resection. Treatment plans were compared to one another and with volume of local recurrence at progression quantitatively and qualitatively by calculating the conformity index (CI), the overlapping volume as a proportion of the total combined volume, where 1 = identical plans and 0 = no conformation whatsoever. Gross tumour volumes (GTVs) using ADC and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences were quantitatively the same (related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test = -0.45, p = 0.653) but showed differing conformations (CI 0.53, p < 0.001). The diffusion treatment volume (DTV) obtained by combining the two target volumes was significantly greater than the treatment volume based on post contrast T1-weighted MRI alone, both quantitatively (median 13.65 vs. 9.52 cm(3), related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001) and qualitatively (CI 0.74, p = 0.001). This DTV covered a greater volume of subsequent tumour recurrence than the standard plan (median 3.53 cm(3) vs. 3.84 cm(3), p = 0.002). ADC maps may be a useful tool in addition to the standard post-contrast T1-weighted sequence used for SRS planning.

N2  -  Metastases are the most prevalent tumors in the brain and are commonly associated with high morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested that brain tumors can induce a loss of functional connectivity and alter the brain network architecture. Little is known about the effect of brain metastases on whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. In this study, 14 patients with brain metastases and 16 healthy controls underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We constructed functional connectivity network using rs-fMRI signal correlations and structural connectivity network using DTI tractography. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to calculate network properties. We further evaluated the performance of brain networks after metastases resection by a simulated method. Compared to healthy controls, patients with brain metastases showed an altered "small-world" architecture in both functional and structural connectivity networks, shifting to a more randomness organization. Besides, the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was decreased in patients. After removing nodes infiltrated by metastases, aggravated disruptions were found in both functional and structural connectivity networks, and the alterations of network properties correlated with the removed hubs number. Our findings suggest that brain metastases interfere with the optimal network organization and relationship of functional and structural connectivity networks, and tumor resection involving hubs could cause a worse performance of brain networks. This study provides neuroimaging guidance for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brain metastases from the aspect of brain networks.

N2  -  In the traumatically injured spinal cord, decreased perfusion is believed to contribute to secondary tissue damage beyond the primary mechanical impact, and restoration of perfusion is believed to be a promising therapeutic target. However, methods to monitor spinal cord perfusion non-invasively are limited. Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques established for the brain have not been routinely adopted to the spinal cord. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) and injury severity in a rat thoracic spinal cord contusion injury (SCI) model using flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) with two variants of the label position. SCBF as a marker of severity was compared to T1 mapping and to spinal cord-optimized diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with filtered parallel apparent diffusion coefficient. Thirty-eight rats underwent a T10 contusion injury with varying severities (8 sham; 10 mild; 10 moderate; 10 severe) with MRI performed at 1 day post injury at the lesion site and follow-up neurological assessments using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scoring up to 28 days post injury. Using whole cord regions of interest at the lesion epicenter, SCBF was decreased with injury severity and had a significant correlation with BBB scores at 28 days post injury. Importantly, estimates of arterial transit times (ATT) in the injured spinal cord were not altered after injury, which suggests that FAIR protocols optimized to measure SCBF provide more value in the context of acute traumatic injury to the cord. T1 -relaxation time constants were strongly related to injury severity and had a larger extent of changes than either SCBF or DWI measures. These findings suggest that perfusion decreases in the spinal cord can be monitored non-invasively after injury, and multi-parametric MRI assessments of perfusion, diffusion, and relaxation capture unique features of the pathophysiology of preclinical injury.

N2  -  Background and purpose: The DKI-IVIM model that incorporates DKI (diffusional kurtosis imaging) into the IVIM (Intravoxel Incoherent Motion) concept was investigated to assess its utility for both enhanced diffusion char-acterization and perfusion measurements in ischemic stroke at 3 T.Methods: Fifteen stroke patients (71 +/- 11 years old) were enrolled and DKI-IVIM analysis was performed using 9 b-values from 0 to 1500 s/mm2 chosen with the Cramer-Rao-Lower-Bound optimization approach. Pseudo -diffusion coefficient D*, perfusion fraction f, blood flow-related parameter fD*, the diffusion coefficient D and an additional parameter, the kurtosis, K were determined in the ischemic lesion and controlateral normal tissue based on a region of interest approach. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) cerebral blood flow (CBF) parameters were also assessed and parametric maps were obtained for all parameters.Results: Significant differences were observed for all diffusion parameters with a significant decrease for D (p < 0.0001), ADC (p < 0.0001), and a significant increase for K (p < 0.0001) in the ischemic lesions of all patients. f decreased significantly in these regions (p = 0.0002). The fD* increase was not significant (p = 0.56). The same significant differences were found with a motion correction except for fD* (p = 0.47). CBF significantly decreased in the lesions. ADC was significantly positively correlated with D (p < 0.0001) and negatively with K (p = 0.0002); K was also negatively significantly correlated with D (p = 0.01).Conclusions: DKI-IVIM model enables for simultaneous cerebral perfusion and enhanced diffusion characteriza-tion in an acceptable clinically acquisition time for the ischemic stroke diagnosis with the additional kurtosis factor estimation, that may better reflect the microstructure heterogeneity.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to assess quantitative changes in T-2 relaxation using magnetic resonance imaging approaches in rats exposed to kainic acid to assess the utility of such endpoints as biomarkers of neurotoxicity. Quantitative T-2 mapping was performed in 21 rats before and 2, 24, and 48h after a single ip injection of 10 mg/kg of kainic acid. Three methods of quantifying T-2 changes were explored: (1) Thresholding: all voxels exhibiting T-2 <= 72ms were designated normal tissue, whereas voxels exhibiting T-2> 72ms were designated as lesioned tissue; (2) Statistical mapping: T-2 maps obtained after treatment were statistically compared with averaged "baseline" maps, voxel-by-voxel; (3) Within-subject difference from baseline: for each individual the baseline T-2 map was subtracted from the T-2 map obtained after treatment. Based on the follow-up histopathological response there were 9 responders, 7 nonresponders, and 5 animals were not classified due to early sacrifice at 2 h which was too soon after treatment to detect any morphological evidence. The "thresholding" method (1) detected differences between groups only at the later time point of 48 h, the "statistical mapping" approach (2) detected differences 24 and 48h after treatment, and the "within-subject difference from baseline" method (3) detected statistically significant differences between groups at each time point (2, 24, and 48 h). T-2 mapping provides an easily quantifiable biomarker and the quantification method employing the use of the same animal as its own control provides the most sensitive metrics.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical expression for a fractional motion (FM) diffusion model to characterize diffusion-induced signal attenuation in a twice-refocused spin-echo (TRSE) sequence that is resilient to eddy currents, and to demonstrate its applicability to human brain imaging in vivo. Based on the FM theory, which provides a unified statistical description for Langevin motions, the diffusion-weighted (DW) MR signal was measured with a TRSE sequence that balances the concomitant gradients. The analytical expression was fitted to a set of DW images acquired with 14 b-values (0-4000s/mm(2)) from a total of 10 healthy human subjects at 3T, yielding three FM parameter maps based on anomalous diffusion coefficient D-phi,D- , diffusion increment variance phi, and diffusion correlation , respectively. These parameters were used to characterize different brain regions in gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid. The analytical expression for the TRSE-based FM model accurately described diffusion signal attenuation in healthy brain tissues at high b-values. TRSE's robustness against eddy currents was illustrated by comparing results from an expression for a conventional Stejskal-Tanner sequence. The TRSE-based FM model also produced consistent GM-WM contrast (p<0.01) across all brain regions studied, whereas the consistency was not observed with the Stejskal-Tanner-based FM model. This new analytical expression is expected to enable further investigations to probe tissue structures by exploiting anomalous diffusion properties without being hindered by eddy-current perturbations at high b-values.

N2  -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and high-grade glioma (HGG) may have similar enhancement patterns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), making the differential diagnosis difficult or even impractical. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and percentage of signal intensity recovery derived from dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR imaging may help distinguish PCNSL from HGG. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of these two imaging parameters used alone or in combination for differentiating PCNSL from HGG.
A total of 12 patients with PCNSL and 26 patients with HGG were examined using a 3T scanner. rCBV and percentage of signal intensity recovery were obtained and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor differentiation. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for identifying the tumor types were also calculated.; The optimum threshold of 2.56 for rCBV provided sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 96.2, 90, 92.6, 94.7, and 93.5 %, respectively, for determining PCNSL. A threshold value of 0.89 for percentage of signal intensity recovery optimized differentiation of PCNSL and HGG with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 100, 88.5, 87, 100, and 93.5 %, respectively. Combining rCBV with the percentage of signal intensity recovery further improved the differentiation of PCNSL and HGG with a specificity of 98.5 % and an accuracy of 95.7 %.; The combination of rCBV measurement with percentage of signal intensity recovery can help in more accurate differentiation of PCNSL from HGG.

N2  -  Clinical outcome after traumatic diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is difficult to predict. In this study, three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were used to quantify the anatomical distribution of lesions, to grade DAI according to the Adams grading system, and to evaluate the value of lesion localization in combination with clinical prognostic factors to improve outcome prediction. Thirty patients (mean 31.2 years +/- 14.3 standard deviation) with severe DAI (Glasgow Motor Score [GMS] < 6) examined with MRI within 1 week post-injury were included. Diffusion-weighted (DW), T2*-weighted gradient echo and susceptibility-weighted (SWI) sequences were used. Extended Glasgow outcome score was assessed after 6 months. Number of DW lesions in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and internal capsule and number of SWI lesions in the mesencephalon correlated significantly with outcome in univariate analysis. Age, GMS at admission, GMS at discharge, and low proportion of good monitoring time with cerebral perfusion pressure < 60mm Hg correlated significantly with outcome in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed an independent relation with poor outcome for age (p = 0.005) and lesions in the mesencephalic region corresponding to substantia nigra and tegmentum on SWI (p = 0.008). We conclude that higher age and lesions in substantia nigra and mesencephalic tegmentum indicate poor long-term outcome in DAI. We propose an extended MRI classification system based on four stages (stage I-hemispheric lesions, stage II-corpus callosum lesions, stage III-brainstem lesions, and stage IV-substantia nigra or mesencephalic tegmentum lesions); all are subdivided by age (>=/<= 30 years).

N2  -  (1) Purpose: To determine the borders of malignant gliomas with diffusion kurtosis and perfusion MRI biomarkers. (2) Methods: In 50 high-grade glioma patients, diffusion kurtosis and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were determined in contrast-enhancing area, in perifocal infiltrative edema zone, in the normal-appearing peritumoral white matter of the affected cerebral hemisphere, and in the unaffected contralateral hemisphere. Neuronavigation-guided biopsy was performed from all affected hemisphere regions. (3) Results: We showed significant differences between the DKI values in normal-appearing peritumoral white matter and unaffected contralateral hemisphere white matter. We also established significant (p < 0.05) correlations of DKI with Ki-67 labeling index and Bcl-2 expression activity in highly perfused enhancing tumor core and in perifocal infiltrative edema zone. CBF correlated with Ki-67 LI in highly perfused enhancing tumor core. One hundred percent of perifocal infiltrative edema tissue samples contained tumor cells. All glioblastoma samples expressed CD133. In the glioblastoma group, several normal-appearing white matter specimens were infiltrated by tumor cells and expressed CD133. (4) Conclusions: DKI parameters reveal changes in brain microstructure invisible on conventional MRI, e.g., possible infiltration of normal-appearing peritumoral white matter by glioma cells. Our results may be useful for plotting individual tumor invasion maps for brain glioma surgery or radiotherapy planning.

N2  -  Identification of Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) can be difficult due to the subtle MRI changes. Though sequences like FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) can detect a large majority of these lesions, there are smaller lesions without signal changes that can easily go unnoticed by the naked eye. The aim of this study is to improve the visibility of focal cortical dysplasia lesions in the T1 weighted brain MRI images. In the proposed method, we used a complex diffusion based approach for calculating the FCD affected areas. Based on the diffused image and thickness map, a complex map is created. From this complex map; FCD areas can be easily identified. MRI brains of 48 subjects selected by neuroradiologists were given to computer scientists who developed the complex map for identifying the cortical dysplasia. The scientists were blinded to the MRI interpretation result of the neuroradiologist. The FCD could be identified in all the patients in whom surgery was done, however three patients had false positive lesions. More lesions were identified in patients in whom surgery was not performed and lesions were seen in few of the controls. These were considered as false positive. This computer aided detection technique using complex diffusion approach can help detect focal cortical dysplasia in patients with epilepsy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Conventional stroke registries contain alphanumeric text-based data on the clinical status of stroke patients, but this format captures imaging data in a very limited form. There is a need for a new type of stroke registry to capture both text-and image-based data. Methods and Results: We designed a next-generation stroke registry containing quantitative magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) data, 'DUIH_SRegI', developed a supporting software package, 'Image_QNA', and performed experiments to assess the feasibility and utility of the system. Image_QNA enabled the mapping of stroke-related lesions on MR onto a standard brain template and the storage of this extracted imaging data in a visual database. Interuser and intrauser variability of the lesion mapping procedure was low. We compared the results from the semi automatic lesion registration using Image_QNA with automatic lesion registration using SPM5 (Statistical Parametric Mapping version 5), a well-regarded standard neuroscience software package, in terms of lesion location, size and shape, and found Image_QNA to be superior. We assessed the clinical usefulness of an image-based registry by studying 47 consecutive patients with first-ever lacunar infarcts in the corona radiata. We used the enriched dataset comprised of both image-based and alphanumeric databases to show that diffusion MR lesions overlapped in a more posterolateral brain location for patients with high NIH Stroke Scale scores (>= 4) than for patients with low scores (<= 3). In April 2009, we launched the first prospective image-based acute (<= 1 week) stroke registry at our institution. The registered data include high signal intensity ischemic lesions on diffusion, T-2-weighted, or fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRIs, and low signal intensity hemorrhagic lesions on gradient-echo MRIs. An interim analysis at 6 months showed that the time requirement for the lesion registration (183 consecutive patients, 3,226 MR slices with visible stroke-related lesions) was acceptable at about 1 h of labor per patient by a trained assistant with physician oversight. Conclusions: We have developed a novel image-based stroke registry, with database functions that allow the formulation and testing of intuitive, image-based hypotheses in a manner not easily achievable with conventional alphanumeric stroke registries.

N2  -  The purpose of our study was to derive from the anatomical literature an easy-to-use map of the brain areas supplied by the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) and to assess the correspondence between damage within the putative AChA areas and clinical symptoms. A thorough review of the literature led to the recognition of 16 anatomical areas which could be delineated on routine diffusion-weighted MR images. A database of 138 consecutive ischemic stroke patients examined with MRI less than 6 h after symptoms onset was thereafter processed in a retrospective way. Patients presenting with at least one damaged AChA area were selected so as to assess the prevalence of AChA infarction and the clinical correlates of the condition. Fifteen patients (11%) had at least one damaged AChA area. Only two of them had "pure" AChA-restricted infarction. Contralateral hemiparesis and contralateral hemianesthesia were best predicted by lesions within the tail of the caudate nucleus with a sensitivity of 87% and 83%, respectively. Homonymous hemianopsia best correlated with lesions within the posterior limb of the internal capsule and within the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 70% for both areas. We concluded that the clinical-radiological correlations did not match the neurophysiological standards, thereby highlighting the limitation of this study, which involved a cohort of acute stroke patients recruited from clinical practice and investigated the clinical impact of these brain lesions, even when documented with the most sensitive imaging modality.

N2  -  Introduction: Malignant brain tumors tend to migration and invasion of surrounding brain tissue. Histopathological studies reported malignant cells in macroscopically unsuspicious parenchyma (normal appearing white matter - NAWM) remote from the tumor localization. In early stages, diffuse interneural infiltration with changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) is hypothesized.
Material and methods: Patients' ADC and FA values from NAWM of the hemisphere contralateral to a malignant glioma were compared to age- and sex-matched normal controls.; Results: Apparent diffusion coefficient levels of the entire contra lateral hemisphere revealed a significant increase and a decrease of FA levels. An even more pronounced ADC increase was found in a region mirroring the glioma location.; Conclusions: In patients with previously untreated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma, an increase of the ADC and a reduction of FA were found in the brain parenchyma of the hemisphere contralateral to the tumor localization. In the absence of visible MRI abnormalities, this may be an early indicator of microstructural changes of the NAWM attributed to malignant brain tumor.

N2  -  Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate the spatial distribution of flow- and permeability-limited perfusion in MCF7 human breast cancer tumors orthotopically implanted in CD1-NU mice.
Materials and Methods: Flow-limited perfusion was derived from H-2-MRI recorded before and after infusion of deuterated water. Permeability-limited perfusion was evaluated from GdDTPA-enhanced H-1-MRI.; Results: The dominant processes in tumor perfusion, namely blood flow and capillary permeability, were mapped in orthotopically implanted MCF7 human breast cancer tumors. The dynamic data were processed according to physiological models, yielding parametric maps of intravascular volume fraction, water perfusion rate, GdDTPA permeability rate constant, and extracellular volume fraction accessible to GdDTPA. The maps exhibited the heterogenous distribution of each perfusion parameter. Most of the tumor tissue (greater than or equal to95%) was perfused with HDO, while GdDTPA was perfused in only about 50% of it. In most loci the perfusion rate was limited by capillary permeability to GdDTPA.; Conclusion: The results demonstrated the instructive value of tracers with different properties used in conjunction to achieve a deeper understanding of tumor perfusion capacity. This study offers tools for the accurate, noninvasive evaluation of drug delivery efficacy.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance (MR) modalities are routine imaging tools in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), which relies on the metabolic characteristics of tissues, has been developed to accelerate the understanding of gliomas and to aid in effective clinical decision making and development of targeted therapies. In this review, the potentials and practical challenges to frequently use this technique in clinical management of gliomas are discussed. The applications of new biomarkers detectable by MRSI in differential glioma diagnosis, pre- and post-treatment evaluations, and neurosurgery are also addressed.

N2  -  Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS) is widely used to elucidate the contribution of different brain regions to various cognitive functions. Here we present three modeling approaches that are informed by functional or structural brain mapping or behavior profiling and discuss how these approaches advance the scientific potential of NTBS as an interventional tool in cognitive neuroscience. (i) Leveraging the anatomical information provided by structural imaging, the electric field distribution in the brain can be modeled and simulated. Biophysical modeling approaches generate testable predictions regarding the impact of interindividual variations in cortical anatomy on the injected electric fields or the influence of the orientation of current flow on the physiological stimulation effects. (ii) Functional brain mapping of the spatiotemporal neural dynamics during cognitive tasks can be used to construct causal network models. These models can identify spatiotemporal changes in effective connectivity during distinct cognitive states and allow for examining how effective connectivity is shaped by NTBS. (iii) Modeling the NTBS effects based on neuroimaging can be complemented by behavior-based cognitive models that exploit variations in task performance. For instance, NTBS-induced changes in response speed and accuracy can be explicitly modeled in a cognitive framework accounting for the speed-accuracy trade-off. This enables to dissociate between behavioral NTBS effects that emerge in the context of rapid automatic responses or in the context of slow deliberate responses. We argue that these complementary modeling approaches facilitate the use of NTBS as a means of dissecting the causal architecture of cognitive systems of the human brain.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) is a novel technique that may have the potential for precise image-guided thermocoagulation of intracranial lesions. The system delivers small volumetric sonications from an ultrasound phased array transmitter that focuses energy selectively to destroy the target with verification by magnetic resonance imaging-generated thermal maps. A Phase I clinical study was initiated to treat patients with recurrent glioma with MRIgFUS.
METHODS:To date, three patients with histologically verified recurrent glioblastoma multiforme have been treated with MRIgFUS. All patients underwent craniectomy 7 to 10 days before therapy to create a bony window for the ultrasound treatment. Sonications were applied to induce thermocoagulation of the enhancing tumor mass. Long-term radiological follow-up and post-treatment tissue specimens were available for all patients.; RESULTS: MRIgFUS treatment resulted in immediate changes in contrast-enhanced T1 -, T2-, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in the treated regions with subsequent histological evidence of thermocoagulation. In one patient, heating of brain tissue in the sonication path resulted in a secondary focus outside the target causing neurological deficit. New software modifications were developed to address this problem.; CONCLUSION: In this first clinical report, M-RIgFUS was demonstrated to be a potentially effective means of destroying tumor tissue by thermocoagulation, although with an associated morbidity and the inherent invasive nature of the procedure requiring creation of a bone window. A modified technology to allow MRIgFUS treatment through a closed cranium is being developed.

N2  -  Neuroimaging represents an important step in the evaluation of pediatric epilepsy. The crucial role of brain imaging in the diagnosis, follow-up and presurgical assessment of patients with epilepsy is noted and has to be familiar to all neuroradiologists and trainees approaching pediatric brain imaging. Morphological qualitative imaging shows the majority of cerebral lesions/alterations underlying focal epilepsy and can highlight some features which are useful in the differential diagnosis of the different types of epilepsy. Recent advances in MRI acquisitions including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), post-acquisition image processing techniques, and quantification of imaging data are increasing the accuracy of lesion detection during the last decades. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be really useful and helps to identify cortical eloquent areas that are essential for language, motor function, and memory, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal white matter tracts that are vital for these functions, thus reducing the risk of epilepsy surgery causing new morbidities. Also positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and fMRI, and electrical and magnetic source imaging can be used to assess the exact localization of epileptic foci and help in the design of intracranial EEG recording strategies. The main role of these "hybrid" techniques is to obtain quantitative and qualitative informations, a necessary step to evaluate and demonstrate the complex relationship between abnormal structural and functional data and to manage a "patient-tailored" surgical approach in epileptic patients.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is considered by experts as one of the key elements in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) employed in oncological studies outside the brain. A low-to-high b value ratio DWI has been proposed as an approach to decrease acquisition time and simplify the analysis of DWI data without the need to use a mathematical model.
Methods: Forty-three men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent mpMRI of the prostate were included. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were created in the MRI scanner using a mono-exponential algorithm b value (x number of averages) =0 (x1), 10 (x1), 25 (x1), 50 (x1), 100 (x1), 250 (x1), 450 (x1), 1,000 (x2), 1,500 (x3), and 2,000 (x5) smm(2). DWI ratio images were calculated with three previously estimated optimal b value combinations: (I) b=100 and b=1,000 smm(2) (R1); (II) b=100 and b=1,500 smm(2) (R2); and (III) b=100 and b=2,000 smm(2) (R3). For quantitative analysis, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between normal and cancerous tissue was compared between the ADC maps and the DWI ratio images in terms of noninferiority. For qualitative analysis, two radiologists read all images in a randomized order without knowing whether the presented image was an ADC map or a DWI ratio image. All images were scored in terms of artifacts, cancer conspicuity and overall image quality with a 5-point scale. Agreement between the readers was assessed by weighted kappa statistics. Agreement was considered as poor when kappa <0.4, fair to good when kappa >0.4 and <0.75 and excellent when kappa >0.75. Mean scores were compared between ADC and each of the DWI ratio images. Agreement between ADC maps and DWI ratio based synthetic ADC were assessed by intraclass correlation (ICC). Values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 were indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Median difference between low and intermediatehigh risk were tested.; Results: Quantitative analysis shows DWI ratio images were not inferior to ADC maps quantitatively P=0.0298 (ADC vs. R1), <0.0001 (ADC vs. R2) and <0.0001 (ADC vs. R3). Qualitatively, DWI ratio images were no more than 0.5 point on Likert scale lower than ADC in overall quality P=0.0043 (ADC vs. R1), <0.0001 (ADC vs. R2), <0.0001 (ADC vs. R3). Reader agreement for the qualitative analysis was good to excellent (weighted kappa =0.4-0.7). Agreement between ADC maps and the synthetic ADC's were excellent. Significant difference between low and intermediatehigh risk were found in all measurements on average (all P values <0.05).; Conclusions: We presented an analytical method for searching for the optimal combination of high and low b values for DWI ratio images in terms of minimizing CNR between cancer and surrounding benign tissues. Optimized DWI ratio images are comparable both quantitatively and qualitatively to ADC maps for the interpretation of DWI data in the context of prostate mpMRI.

N2  -  Purpose: We retrospectively evaluated our experience with stenting of the vertebral artery in an effort to determine the risk of distal embolization associated with the procedure.
Methods: Between June 2000 and May 2005, 35 patients with 38 stenting procedures for atherosclerotic disease of the vertebral origin in our institution were identified. The average age of the patients was 60.3 years (range 32-76 years). Sixteen of these patients (with 18 stents) had MR imaging of the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and an apparent diffusion coefficient map within 2 days before and after procedure.; Results: On seven of the 16 postprocedural diffusion-weighted MR images, a total of 57 new hyperintensities were visible. All these lesions were focal in nature. One patient demonstrated a new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormality in the anterior circulation without MR evidence of posterior circulation ischemia. Six of 16 patients had a total of 25 new lesions in the vertebrobasilar circulation in postprocedural diffusion-weighted MR images. One patient in this group was excluded from the final analysis because the procedure was complicated by basilar rupture during tandem stent deployment in the basilar artery. Hence, new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities were noted in the vertebrobasilar territory in 5 of 15 patients after 17 stenting procedures, giving a 29% rate of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities per procedure. No patient with bilateral stenting had new diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities.; Conclusion: Stenting of stenoses of the vertebral artery origin may be associated with a significant risk of asymptomatic distal embolization. Angiography, placement of the guiding catheter, inflation of the stent balloon, and crossing the lesion with guidewires or balloon catheters may potentially cause distal embolization. Further studies to evaluate measures to increase the safety of vertebral artery stenting, such as the use of distal protection devices or short-term postprocedural anticoagulation, should be considered for patients with clear indications for this procedure.

N2  -  Purpose: To retrospectively assess the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for prediction of malignancy and prognosis of malignant astrocytic tumors.
Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved this study and did not require patient informed consent. Findings from 37 consecutive patients (21 men, 16 women; mean age, 43 years) with pathologically proved malignant astrocytic tumors that included 22 glioblastomas (GBMs) and 15 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) were retrospectively evaluated. The minimum ADC value of each tumor was preoperatively determined from several regions of interest defined in the tumor, preferably with avoidance of cystic or necrotic components, on ADC maps derived from isotropic diffusion-weighted images. Surgical intervention followed by radiation therapy, was undertaken in all cases according to hospital protocol. Immunohistologically, Ki-67 labeling index (LI), indicating cell proliferation, was also determined. The patients were classified into two groups, progressive and stable, according to the 2-year observation after the initial treatment. Correlation analysis (Pearson product moment correlation), Student t test, Welch test, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test were used for statistical evaluation.; Results: There was a significant, negative correlation between minimum ADC and Ki-67 Ll (r = -0.562, P < .001). The mean minimum ADC (0.834 x 10(-1) mm(2) (.) sec(-1)) of GBM was significantly lower than that (1.06 x 10(-3) mm(2) (.) sec(-1)) of AA (P < .001, Student t test). The mean minimum ADC (0.80 x 10(-3) mm(2) (.) sec(-1)) of the progressive group was significantly lower than that (1.037 x 10(-3) mm(2 .) sec(-1)) of the stable group (P < .001). The cutoff value of 0.90 x 10(-3) mm(2 .) sec(-1) for minimum ADC for differentiation of patients with a favorable prognosis from those with a poor prognosis provided the best combination of sensitivity (79%) and specificity (81%) (receiver operating characteristic analysis). The significant difference in the prognosis between two groups classified by using this cutoff value of minimum ADC was noted (P = .002, log-rank test).; Conclustion: The minimum ADC of malignant astrocytomas can provide additional information about their clinical malignancy related to posttreatment prognosis.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
An important task in diagnostic imaging of acute ischemic stroke is to identify the so-called diffusion-perfusion mismatch area. We aimed to investigate the possibility of facilitating the identification process by combining independent component analysis (ICA) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), with the expectation that this would eliminate the need for additional perfusion imaging to delineate perfusion lesion.; METHODS; Simulations were performed to confirm the utility of an intuitively determined sequence of 14 b-factors ranging from 0 to 1,000 secondsmm(2) for ICA separation of perfusion lesion. Corresponding DWI data from 2 stroke patients, 1 in the acute and 1 in the subacute phase, were decomposed into independent component (IC) maps, and their b-dependent amplitude decay profiles were subjected to multiexponential fitting.; RESULTS; Low-perfusion areas were successfully delineated on IC maps in both patients. Comparison with the areas of diffusion lesion identifiable on relatively high b-factor images in the DWI data, for example, those at b = 1,000 secondsmm(2), allowed the mismatch to be identified.; CONCLUSION; This study demonstrates that combining ICA and DWI enables noninvasive mapping of sluggish perfusion provided an appropriate b-sequence is applied, and that it thereby facilitates the identification of diffusion-perfusion mismatch.

N2  -  The pyramidal tract (PT) was dissected in 30 normal human hemispheres according to the method of Klingler27,32. The various dimensions as well as the cerebral landmarks were studied. The pyramidal tract is built up like a fan in the white matter by a thin layer of fibers of 2.8-3.5 mm in thickness. The fibers converge toward the internal capsule to a solid fiber tract with a lateral and apdiameter of 7.8 +/- 1.6 mm and 17.5 +/- 2.1 mm, respectively. This configuration of the PT presents different possibilities of damage during surgery.
The evaluation of the three-dimensional course of the PT is possible by using three cerebral landmarks, the precentral gyrus, the entrance into the internal capsule and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Their topography is described. Additionally the pyramidal tract can be defined medially by the sulcus cinguli and the roof of the lateral ventricle and laterally by the superior sulcus circularis Insulae. The possible displacement of the PT by space occupying lesions and the intra-operative orientation is discussed.

N2  -  Background and Objective: Modeling of glioma growth and evolution is of key importance for cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical progression and improving treatment outcomes of neurosurgery. However, existing models are unable to characterize spatial variations of the proliferation and infiltration of tumor cells, making it difficult to achieve accurate prediction of tumor growth. Methods: In this paper, a new growth model of brain tumor using a reaction-diffusion equation on brain magnetic resonance images is proposed. Both the heterogeneity of brain tissue and the density of tumor cells are used to estimate the proliferation and diffusion coefficients of brain tumor cells. The diffusion coefficient that characterizes tumor diffusion and infiltration is calculated based on the ratio of tissues (white and gray matter), while the proliferation coefficient is evaluated using the spatial gradient of tumor cells. In addition, a parame-ter space is constructed using inverse distance weighted interpolation to describe the spatial distribution of proliferation coefficient.Results: The glioma growth predicted by the proposed model were tested by comparing with the real magnetic resonance images of the patients. Experiments and simulation results show that the proposed method achieves accurate modeling of glioma growth. The interpolation-based growth model has higher average dice score of 0.0647 and 0.0545, and higher average Jaccard index of 0.0673 and 0.0573, respectively, compared to the uniform-and gradient-based growth models. Conclu-sions: The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of calculating the proliferation and diffusion coefficients of the growth model based on patient-specific anatomy. The parameter space that charac-terizes spatial distribution of proliferation and diffusion coefficients is established and incorporated into the simulation of glioma growth. It enables to obtain patient-specific models about glioma growth by estimating and calibrating only a few model parameters.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: Motor deficit is the most common disability after stroke, and early prediction of motor outcome is critical for early interventions. Here, we constructed a fine map of the corticospinal tract (CST) for early prediction of motor outcome and for understanding the secondary brain changes after subcortical stroke. Methods: Diffusion spectrum imaging data from 50 healthy adults were used to reconstruct fine maps of CST with different origins, including primary motor area (M1), primary sensory area (S1), premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area (SMA). Their diffusion properties correlated with motor functions in healthy adults. The impacts of the impairments of different CST on motor outcomes and on structural and functional changes of brain were investigated in 136 patients with subcortical stroke by combining CST damage-symptom association study and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Results: In healthy adults, the isotropy of M1 fiber correlated with walking endurance and that of SMA fiber with motor dexterity. In chronic stroke patients, the integrity of M1 and SMA fibers showed the most significant correlation with motor deficits. The percentage of early damage of M1 and SMA fibers correlated with that of chronic motor deficits. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that acute stroke lesions in the bilateral M1 and right SMA fibers were associated with chronic motor deficits. The early damage of M1 fiber negatively correlated with the integrity of M1-M1 fiber, and the early damage of SMA fiber negatively correlated with gray matter volume of the contralateral cerebellum in the chronic stage. Conclusions: The CST that originated from the M1 and SMA are closely associated with motor outcomes and brain structural changes, and the fine maps of CST from these 2 cortical areas are useful in assessing and predicting long-term motor outcome in patients with subcortical stroke.

N2  -  The utility of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for assessing intra-tumor heterogeneity was evaluated in a rat model of glioblastoma multiforme. Longitudinal MRI includingT(2)-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) was performed on six female Fischer rats 8, 11 and 14 days after intracranial transplantation of F98 cells.T-2-weighted images were used to measure the tumor volumes and DWI images were used to compute diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DWI based parametric maps including mean diffusivity (MD), mean kurtosis (MK), axial diffusivity (AD), axial kurtosis, radial diffusivity, radial kurtosis, fractional anisotropy (FA) and kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA). Median values from the segmented normal contralateral cortex, tumor and edema from the diffusion parameters were compared at the three imaging time points to assess any changes in tumor heterogeneity over time. ex vivo DKI was also performed in a representative sample and compared with histology. Significant differences were observed between normal cortex, tumor and edema in both the DTI and DKI parameters. Notably, at the earliest time point MK and KFA were significantly different between normal cortex and tumor in comparison with MD or FA. Although a decreasing trend in MD, AD and FA values of the tumor were observed as the tumor grew, no significant changes in any of the DTI or DKI parameters were observed longitudinally. While DKI was equally sensitive to DTI in differentiating tumor from edema and normal brain, it was unable to detect longitudinal increases in intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the F98 model of glioblastoma multiforme.

N2  -  Background: Fresh ischemic lesions (FILs) can occur in both the brain's gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), with each location signifying a different prognosis for patients. This study aims to investigate the application of ultra-high b value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in distinguishing FILs in these two areas via a comparative study with routine and high b value DWI.
Methods: Multiple b value DWI (b=0, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, 10,000 smm(2)) was performed on 47 patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, including ADC(500), ADC(1,000), ADC(2,000), ADC(4,000), ADC(6,000), ADC(8,000), and ADC(10,000), were calculated, and the mean ADC value of the FILs in the GM and WM on each map was obtained by referring to the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ADC value differences of the FILs in the GM and WM were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated the diagnostic efficiency of each ADC value in distinguishing FILs in the two areas.; Results: In the enrolled 34 patients, 145 FILs were identified, of which 42 involved the GM, 87 the WM, and 16 both the GM and WM. A total of 161 regions were delineated, 58 in the GM and 103 in the WM. The values of FILs in the WM on ADC(2,000), ADC(4,000), ADC(6,000), ADC(8,000), and ADC(10,000) maps were significantly lower than those in the GM (P=0.007, P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), while no significant differences were found on ADC(500) and ADC(1,000) maps (P=0.427 and P=0.225, respectively). ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) paralleled the increasing b value, ascending from ADC(500) to ADC(10,000) (0.538, 0.558, 0.629, 0.766, 0.827, 0.859, 0.872, in that order).; Conclusions: Ultra-high b value DWI is extremely sensitive to the slight diffusion difference between FILs in the GM and the WM. Its sensitivity parallels the increasing b value, indicating its clinical advantage in identifying the microstructure of FILs.

N2  -  To study brain abnormalities, in terms of non-Gaussian water diffusion properties using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) in children with electroencephalography (EEG) confirmed epilepsy lateralized to both hemispheres.
A total of 15 children with epileptiform waves on EEG in both hemispheres and 18 children as normal controls (NC) matched for age and sex were recruited. Data from DKI for all children were used to characterize non-Gaussian properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) maps were estimated from the DKI datasets. Voxel-based analyses (VBA) based on these measures were performed and compared between the epilepsy and NC groups.; The VBA showed abnormal regions in both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) in those with epilepsy. Analysis of FA values revealed that the abnormal regions were significant mainly in the left frontal and temporal lobes of the WM. Analysis of MD values revealed that differences were significant mainly in the right hemisphere of the limbic lobe, uncus, parahippocampal region, both in GM and WM of frontal and temporal lobes, and GM of the rectus of the left cerebrum. Finally, analysis of MK values revealed significant differences mainly in WM of the frontal lobes of both cerebrum, and GM and WM of the parietal lobe of the right cerebrum.; These preliminary results suggest that DKI is sensitive for the characterization of diffusion abnormalities in both WM and GM of children with epilepsy.

N2  -  The extent of the penumbra and the core of an acute ischemic stroke influence, at the given time, the impact of the recanalization of the occluded vessel on the outcome. Research studies have demonstrated that quantitative MR diffusion imaging and, to a lesser extent, CT perfusion (CTP) could provide an acceptable estimation of the size of the core, while perfusion imaging thresholds could outline critically hypoperfused regions. Several software programs now automatically process reliable quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion maps in real time, making them available for clinical routine. Studies investigating whether acute MRI profile could select patient for acute recanalization after the 4.5 h time window approved for rtPA administration are ongoing. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a major risk factor for stroke but its clinical diagnosis is difficult. MRI can confirm the ischemic nature of transient neurological symptoms among 50% of the patients and the presence of an acute diffusion lesion is an independent risk factor for acute stroke. Multimodal imaging of ischemic stroke and TIA provides a tissue-based characterization of the ischemic lesion that is dramatically influencing the diagnosis and the management of the patients.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Similar-sized stroke lesions at similar locations can have different prognoses in clinical practice. Lesion-network mapping elucidates network-level effects of lesions that cause specific neurologic symptoms and signs, and also provides a group-level understanding. This study visualized the effects of stroke lesions on the functional brain networks of individual patients.
Methods We enrolled patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized within 1 week of the stroke occurrence. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed 3 months after the index stroke. For image preprocessing, acute stroke lesions were visually delineated based on diffusion-weighted images obtained at admission, and the lesion mask was drawn using MRIcron software. Correlation matrices were calculated from 280 brain regions using the Brainnetome Atlas, and connectograms were visualized using in-house MATLAB code.; Results We found characteristic differences in connectograms between pairs of patients who had comparable splenial, frontal cortical, cerebellar, and thalamocapsular lesions. Two representative patients with bilateral thalamic infarctions showed significant differences in their reconstructed connectograms. The cognitive function had recovered well at 3 months after stroke occurrence in patients with well-maintained interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivities.; Conclusions This pilot study has visualized the effects of stroke lesions on the functional brain networks of individual patients. Consideration of the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying the differences between their connectograms has yielded new hypotheses about differences in the effects of stroke lesions.

N2  -  Rationale: Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is an infection-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy syndrome that is predominately caused by a virus. MERS has no direct association with central nervous system (CNS) infections or inflammation. Non-CNS infections may cause reversible lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum. Recently, there have been reports of many patients with hyponatremia related MERS. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was also found elevated in serum and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MERS. The role of IL-6 in the non-osmotic release of vasopressin is crucial. Persistent hyponatremia may be linked to this effect. The following is a case report of MERS secondary to encephalitis, complicated by hyponatremia. We will summarize the latest research and progress regarding MERS. Patient concerns: A 31-year-old man was admitted to our department with a 5-day history of fever and headache. His initial diagnosis was encephalitis and hyponatremia; during this period the patient also developed MERS secondary to the encephalitis. Diagnoses: Encephalitis was diagnosed by reviewing the history of fever, headache, neck rigidity and Kerning sign (+) on clinical examination. Lab tests revealed: serum VCA IgG (+), EBNA-1 IgG (-), EBV IgM (-), and inflammation in the analysis of CSF. Cranial MRI+C showed that the blood vessels on the surface of the brain were obviously increasing and thickening and diffuse slow waves were detected on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The patient's hyponatremia aggravated on the third day of hospitalization. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient was somnolent, apathetic, and slow. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, with a T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery image, showed high-signal intensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) on the fifth day of hospitalization. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed splenial hyperintensity as a "boomerang sign" and reduced diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Cranial MRI findings returned to normal after 1 month. The diagnosis of MERS was confirmed. Interventions: We administered an intravenous drip infusion of acyclovir and prescribed oral sodium supplementation. Outcomes: The patient's neurological symptoms gradually improved. The MRI lesion in the SCC disappeared on the 30th day. Lessons: In patients with encephalitis accompanied by hyponatremia, elevated IL-6 or urinary beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2MG), and exacerbations such as sudden somnolence, delirium, confusion, and seizures, the possibility of secondary MERS should be investigated, in addition to the progression of encephalitis.

N2  -  An accurate computer-assisted method to perform segmentation of brain tumor on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images and evaluate its grade (malignancy state) has been designed usimg a Mixture of unsupervised artificial neural networks (ANN) and hierarchical multi resolution wavelet. Firstly, the ADC images are decomposed by multiresolution wavelets, which are subsequently selectively reconstructed to form wavelet filtered images. These wavelet filtered images along with FLAIR and T2 weighted images have been utilized as the features to unsupervised neural network-self organizing maps (SOM) - to segment the tumor, edema, necrosis, CSF and normal tissue and grade the malignant state of the tumor. A novel segmentation algorithm based on the number of hits experienced by Best Matching Units (BMU) on SOM maps is proposed. The results shows that the SOM performs well in differentiating the tumor, edema, necrosis, CSF and normal tissue pattern vectors on ADC images. Using the trained SOM and proposed segmentation algorithm, we are able to identify high or low grade tumor, edema, necrosis, CSF and normal tissue. The results are validated against manually segmented images and sensitivity and the specificity are observed to be 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Using perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MR imaging in acute ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), previous studies have shown a typical pathophysiologic pattern that is characterized by a perfusion deficit larger than the diffusion lesion (mismatch), with the final lesion usually comprising the initial diffusion lesion (core) plus parts of the initial mismatch area. Little is known about underlying pathophysiology in small ischemic stroke. In this study, we used perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MR imaging to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of small subcortical ischemia.
METHODS: Six consecutive patients (age range, 42-76 years) with small subcortical ischemia were examined by using a 1.5-T MR system 2-5, 22-55, and 144-392 hours after the onset of symptoms. T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging at b = 0 smm(2) and b = 1000 smm(2), and bolus-track perfusion-weighted imaging were performed. Lesion sizes were determined on the basis of T2-weighted findings as well as those of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and CBF.; RESULTS: In every patient, the initial CBF lesion was smaller than the initial ADC lesion. Both the CBF lesion and the ADC lesion increased in size from first to second examination. In all instances, however, the CBF lesion remained smaller than the ADC lesion. The CBF lesion observed during the acute phase and the one seen on the following days were both smaller than the final T2 lesion.; CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in contrast to previous findings in MCA ischemia in small subcortical infarcts tissue damage may spread beyond the area of the initial perfusion disturbance. In light of the small number of patients, further studies will have to address the relevance of this observation.

N2  -  Contrast agents have greatly expanded the role of MR imaging (MRI) to allow assessment of physiologic, or ''functional,'' parameters, Although activation mapping generally does not require contrast agents, other forms of functional MRI, including mapping of cerebral hemodynamics (eg, perfusion imaging), are best done with the use of contrast agents, Serial echo planar images are obtained after bolus injection of lanthanide chelates. Application of susceptibility contrast physics and standard tracer kinetic principles permits generation of relative cerebral blood volume maps, Deconvolution of cerebral blood flow and mean transit time parameters is also possible within technical limitations, By using diffusion and perfusion pulse sequences, an imaging correlate to the ischemic penumbra can be identified. Functional MRI perfusion imaging of intraaxial tumors is analogous to positron emission tomography for delineation of metabolic activity, yet may be even more sensitive to neo-vascularity and possesses improved image quality, Clinical applications include biopsy site selection and postirradiation follow-up, Further improvements in data analysis and map generation techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy and utility.

N2  -  We studied chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment via resting state (RS)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 19 cases of patients with early breast cancer. White matter neuropsychological test treatment were carried out before and after chemotherapy, RS-fMRI, and DTI evaluation. In RS-fMRI with regional homogeneity (ReHo) reflects brain activity. In the DTI with fractional anisotropy (FA) reflect the integrity of the white matter. Determining the region of interest by image analysis, we calculated the neuropsychologic test score using the paired t-test and FA change ReHo values of regions of interest. Finally after the test treatment, in the chemotherapy group for pairing correlation analysis t-test scores change in meaningful inspection and change ReHo and FA. Chemotherapy after chemotherapy than before chemotherapy difference memory test and self-evaluation of cognitive (P < 0.05). ReHo value increases occurred in the right orbitofrontal region and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Declines in brain regions were the anterior inferior cerebellar lobe, cerebellar lobe, right middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus, the lower right of the center area, and the central gyrus. This prospective study on resting state and RS-fMRI functional magnetic resonance DTI study DTI sequence combination chemotherapy for breast cancer-related cognitive disorders supports the "chemo brain" point of view. Chemotherapy can cause memory decline, accompanied by a partial area of the brain and white matter integrity in brain activity changes. Prompt clinical treatment RS-fMRI and DTI have potential applications in assessing chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

N2  -  Mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of ischemic stroke shows high rates of recanalization; however, some patients still have a poor clinical outcome. A proposed reason for this relates to the fact that the ischemic infarct growth differs significantly between patients. While some patients demonstrate rapid evolution of their infarct core (fast evolvers), others have substantial potentially salvageable penumbral tissue even hours after initial vessel occlusion (slow evolvers). We show that the dog middle cerebral artery occlusion model recapitulates this key aspect of human stroke rendering it a highly desirable model to develop novel multimodal treatments to improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, this model is well suited to develop novel image analysis techniques that allow for improved lesion evolution prediction; we provide proof-of-concept that MRI perfusion-based time-to-peak maps can be utilized to predict the rate of infarct growth as validated by apparent diffusion coefficient-derived lesion maps allowing reliable classification of dogs into fast versus slow evolvers enabling more robust study design for interventional research.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) involving cortical eloquent areas and subcortical functional pathways represents a challenge in neurosurgery. Patient-specific, 3-dimensional (3D)-printed models of head and brain structures have emerged in recent years as an educational and clinical tool for patients, doctors, and surgical residents.
METHODS: Using multimodal high-definition magnetic resonance imaging data, which incorporates information from specific task-based functional neuroimaging and diffusion tensor imaging tractography and rapid prototyping technologies with specialized software and "in-house" 3D printing, we were able to generate 3D-printed head models that were used for preoperative patient education and consultation, surgical planning, and resident training in 2 complicated DLGG surgeries.; RESULTS: This 3D-printed model is rapid prototyped and shows a means to model individualized, diffuse, low-level glioma in 3D space with respect to cortical eloquent areas and subcortical pathways. Survey results from 8 surgeons with different levels of expertise strongly support the use of this model for surgical planning, intraoperative surgical guidance, doctor-patient communication, and surgical training (>95% acceptance).; CONCLUSIONS: Spatial proximity of DLGG to cortical eloquent areas and subcortical tracts can be readily assessed in patient-specific 3D printed models with high fidelity. 3D-printed multimodal models could be helpful in preoperative patient consultation, surgical planning, and resident training.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  We discuss the assessment of signal change in single magnetic resonance images (MRI) based on quantifying significant departure from a reference distribution estimated from a large sample of normal subjects. The parametric approach is to build a test based on the expected distribution of extrema in random fields. However, in conditions where the variance is not uniform across the volume and the smoothness of the images is moderate to low, this test may be rather conservative. Furthermore, parametric tests are limited to datasets for which distributional assumptions hold. This paper investigates resampling methods that improve statistical tests for signal changes in single images in such adverse conditions, and that can be used for the assessment of images taken for clinical purposes. Two methods, the bootstrap and cross-validation, are compared. It is shown that the bootstrap may fail to provide a good estimate of the distribution of extrema of parametric maps. In contrast, calibration of the significance threshold by means of cross-validation (or related sampling without replacement techniques) address three issues at once: improved power, better voxel-by-voxel estimate of variance by local pooling, and adaptation to departures from ideal distributional assumptions on the signal. We apply the cross-validated tests to apparent diffusion coefficient maps, a type of MRI capable of detecting changes in the microstructural organization of brain parenchyma. We show that deviations from parametric assumptions are strong enough to cast doubt on the correctness of parametric tests for these images. As case studies, we present parametric maps of lesions in patients suffering from stroke and glioblastoma at different stages of evolution.

N2  -  Purpose An accurate differentiation of brain glioma grade constitutes an important clinical issue. Powerful non-invasive approach based on diffusion MRI has already demonstrated its feasibility in glioma grade stratification. However, the conventional diffusion tensor (DTI) and kurtosis imaging (DKI) demonstrated moderate sensitivity and performance in glioma grading. In the present work, we apply generalised DKI (gDKI) approach in order to assess its diagnostic accuracy and potential application in glioma grading.
Methods Diffusion scalar metrics were obtained from 50 patients with different glioma grades confirmed by histological tests following biopsy or surgery. All patients were divided into two groups with low- and high-grade gliomas as grade II versus grades III and IV, respectively. For a comparison, trained radiologists segmented the brain tissue into three regions with solid tumour, oedema, and normal appearing white matter. For each region, we estimated the conventional and gDKI metrics including DTI maps.; Results We found high correlations between DKI and gDKI metrics in high-grade glioma. Further, gDKI metrics enabled introduction of a complementary measure for glioma differentiation based on correlations between the conventional and generalised approaches. Both conventional and generalised DKI metrics showed quantitative maps of tumour heterogeneity and oedema behaviour. gDKI approach demonstrated largely similar sensitivity and specificity in low-high glioma differentiation as in the case of conventional DKI method.; Conclusion The generalised diffusion kurtosis imaging enables differentiation of low- and high-grade gliomas at the same level as the conventional DKI. Additionally, gDKI exhibited higher sensitivity to tumour heterogeneity and tissue contrast between tumour and healthy tissue and, thus, may contribute as a complementary source of information on tumour differentiation.

N2  -  Patients with spinal cord injury suffered from not only motor paralysis but also intolerable neuropathic pain. Regarding the mechanism, various theories such as functional changes in the brain, disorders within the spinal dorsal horn and/or spinothalamic tract have been proposed. However, the feasible animal models with solid reproducibility has been insufficiently verified. We have established the mice fMRI system, reported the results of mice-fMRI after L5 nerve injury and resting state-fMRI imaging after thoracic cord transection injury in mice. Furthermore, in a clinical setting we evaluated the brain morphometry of the cases with spinal intramedullary tumor surgery by VBM, and found the gray matter volume of some brain regions was increased related with pain intensity. Besides fMRI and VBM analysis, we developed diffusion MRI techniques which could depict neuronal axons and myelination within the spinal cord ("diffusion tensor tractgraphy" and "myelin map", respectively). In this review, I would like to outline our results of MRI analysis of neuropathic pain so far.

N2  -  Small vessel disease is a major contributor to the growing burden of cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition to diagnosis, MRI techniques provide a means to investigate mechanisms of cognitive decline. Studies that incorporate diffusion tensor MRI show that variance in cognitive performance is largely accounted for by alterations in brain structure. Unresolved questions about the link between structure and function include: (1) the relative importance of a small number of strategic lesions versus the cumulative effect of multiple lesions; (2) the underlying basis for the characteristic profile of cognitive impairment, with selective deficits of executive function, processing speed and working memory. This update focuses on MRI approaches to these problems and techniques to analyze spatial distribution of damage in relation to the networks that subserve major cognitive functions. Lesion mapping and voxel-based analysis, and the application of diffusion tensor MRI tractography to reconstruct critical white matter projections, are highly promising approaches for improving understanding of the relationship between structure and function and the mechanisms of cognitive decline.

N2  -  Background: CADASIL is responsible for diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter on FLAIR images. These lesions are often associated with focal lesions in the basal ganglia such as lacunar infarctions. The prevalence and significance of diffuse or confluent thalamic hyperintensities (CTH) remain unknown. Methods: The frequency of hyperintensities on FLAIR images in the thalamus was assessed in 147 CADASIL patients, and signal abnormalities on both FLAIR and T-1-weighted images were categorized as focal/punctuate or diffuse/confluent by the same reader. The areas of increased diffusion were also analyzed on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. The association of CTH with vascular risk factors, the main clinical manifestations of the disease and MRI markers (brain parenchymal fraction, volume of white matter hyperintensities, volume of lacunar infarcts and number of microbleeds) was analyzed with generalized linear regression models. Results: CTH were detected in 12% of the CADASIL subjects in association with hypointensities on T-1-weighted images. CTH corresponded to areas of increased diffusion apparent diffusion coefficient maps. CTH were found significantly associated with age and independently related to the volume of white matter hyperintensities but not to that of lacunar infarctions or to cerebral atrophy after adjustment for age and sex. No significant association was found between CTH and global cognitive performances. Conclusion: CTH are observed on FLAIR images in a sizeable proportion of CADASIL patients. They are mainly related to the extent of white matter hyperintensities and do not correlate with cognitive decline. Demyelination and/or loss of glial cells appear to be the most plausible cause of these confluent signal changes in the thalamus. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a cytosolic protein with microtubule stabilization and calcium-binding activities. TCTP is expressed in most organs including the nervous system. However, detailed distribution and functional significance of TCTP in the brain remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the global and subcellular distributions of TCTP in the mouse brain. Immunohistochemical analyses with anti-TCTP revealed that TCTP was widely distributed in almost all regions of the brain including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, wherein it was localized in axon tracts and axon terminals. In the hippocampus, TCTP was prominently localized to axon terminals of the perforant path in the dentate gyrus, the mossy fibers in the cornu ammonis (CA) 3 region, and the Schaffer collaterals in the CA1 field, but not in cell bodies of granule cells and pyramidal neurons, and in their dendritic processes. Widespread distribution of TCTP in axon tracts and axon terminals throughout the brain suggests that TCTP is likely involved in neurotransmitter release and/or maintaining synaptic structures in the brain, and that it might have a role in maintaining synaptic functions and synaptic configurations important for normal cognitive, stress and emotional functions.

N2  -  Object. Preserving motor function is a major challenge in surgery for intraaxial brain tumors. Navigation systems are unreliable in predicting the location of the corticospinal tracts (CSTs) because of brain shift and the inability of current intraoperative systems to produce reliable diffusion tensor imaging data. The authors describe their experience with elaborate neurophysiological assessment and tractography-based navigation, corrected in real time by 3D intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) to identify motor pathways during subcortical tumor resection.
Methods. A retrospective analysis was conducted in 55 patients undergoing resection of tumors located within or in proximity to the CSTs at the authors' institution between November 2007 and June 2009. Corticospinal tract tractography was coregistered to surgical navigation-derived images in 42 patients. Direct cortical-stimulated motor evoked potentials (dcMEPs) and subcortical-stimulated MEPs (scrtMEPs) were recorded intraoperatively to assess function and estimate the distance from the CSTs. Intraoperative ultrasonography updated the navigation imaging and estimated resection proximity to the CSTs. Preoperative clinical motor function was compared with postoperative outcome at several time points and correlated with incidences of intraoperative dcMEP alarm and low scrtMEP values.; Results. The threshold level needed to elicit scrtMEPs was plotted against the distance to the CSTs based on diffusion tensor imaging tractography after brain shift compensation with 3D IOUS, generating a trend line that demonstrated a linear. order between these variables, and a relationship of 0.97 mA for every I mm of brain tissue distance from the CSTs. Clinically, 39 (71%) of 55 patients had no postoperative deficits, and 9 of the remaining 16 improved to baseline function within 1 month. Seven patients had varying degrees of permanent motor deficits. Subcortical stimulation was applied in 45 of the procedures. The status of 32 patients did not deteriorate postoperatively (stable or improved motor status): 27 of them (84%) displayed minimum scrtMEP thresholds >7 mA. Six patients who experienced postoperative deterioration quickly recovered (within 5 days) and displayed minimum scrtMEP thresholds >6.8 mA. Five of the 7 patients who had late (>5 days postoperatively) or no recovery had minimal scrtMEP thresholds <3 mA. An scrtMEP threshold of 3 mA was found to be the cutoff point below which irreversible disruption of CST integrity may be anticipated (sensitivity 83%, specificity 95%).; Conclusions. Combining elaborate neurophysiological assessment, tractography-based neuronavigation, and updated IOUS images provided accurate localization of the CSTs and enabled the safe resection of tumors approximating these tracts. This is the first attempt to evaluate the distance from the CSTs using the threshold of subcortical monopolar stimulation with real-time IOUS for the correction of brain shift. The linear correlation between the distance to the CSTs and the threshold of subcortical stimulation producing a motor response provides an intraoperative technique to better preserve motor function.

N2  -  IntroductionGray matter (GM) atrophy is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the relationship with white matter (WM) pathology is largely unknown. Some studies found a co-occurrence in specific systems, but a regional analysis across the brain in different clinical phenotypes is necessary to further understand the disease mechanism underlying GM atrophy in MS. Therefore, we investigated the association between regional GM atrophy and pathology in anatomically connected WM tracts.
MethodsConventional and diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 3T in 208 patients with long-standing MS and 60 healthy controls. Deep and cortical GM regions were segmented and quantified, and both lesion volumes and average normal appearing WM fractional anisotropy of their associated tracts were derived using an atlas obtained by probabilistic tractography in the controls. Linear regression was then performed to quantify the amount of regional GM atrophy that can be explained by WM pathology in the connected tract.; ResultsMS patients showed extensive deep and cortical GM atrophy. Cortical atrophy was particularly present in frontal and temporal regions. Pathology in connected WM tracts statistically explained both regional deep and cortical GM atrophy in relapsing-remitting (RR) patients, but only deep GM atrophy in secondary-progressive (SP) patients.; ConclusionIn RRMS patients, both deep and cortical GM atrophy were associated with pathology in connected WM tracts. In SPMS patients, only regional deep GM atrophy could be explained by pathology in connected WM tracts. This suggests that in SPMS patients cortical GM atrophy and WM damage are (at least partly) independent disease processes. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:1796-1807, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  The feeling of "body ownership" may be experimentally investigated by perceptual illusions. The "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) leads human subjects to experience an artificial hand as their own. According to functional imaging, the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) plays a key role in the integration of multisensory inputs allowing the "incorporation" of the rubber hand into body representation. However, causal structure-function relationships can only be obtained by lesion studies.
Here, we tested the RHI in 70 stroke patients and in 40 age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, asomatognosia, the unawareness of one's own body parts, was assessed in a subgroup of 64 stroke patients. Ischemic lesions were delineated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and normalized. Right-hemispheric lesions were mirrored across the midline. Voxels that might be essential for RHI andor somatognosia were defined by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to identify tracts passing through these voxels.; Contralesional rubber hand illusion failure (RHIF) was observed in 18 (26%) of 70 stroke patients, an additional ipsilesional RHIF in seven of these patients. RHIF-associated lesion voxels were located subcortically adjacent to the insula, basal ganglia, and within the periventricular white matter. Tractography revealed fiber tract connections of these voxels with premotor, parietal, and prefrontal cortex.; Contralesional asomatognosia was found in 18 (28%) of 64 stroke patients. In contrast to RHIF, asomatognosia-associated lesion voxels showed no connection with PMv.; The results point to a role of PMv and its connections in mediating changes in the sense of limb ownership driven by multisensory stimulation.

N2  -  Background: Cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps derived from dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI are useful but not commonly available in clinical scenarios.Purpose: To test image-to-image translation techniques for generating CBV maps from standard MRI sequences of brain tumors using the bookend technique DSC MRI as ground-truth references.Materials and Methods: A total of 756 MRI examinations, including quantitative CBV maps produced from bookend DSC MRI, were included in this retrospective study. Two algorithms, the featureconsistency generative adversarial network (GAN) and threedimen-sional encoder-decoder network with only mean absolute error loss, were trained to synthesize CBV maps. The performance of the two algorithms was evaluated quantitatively using the structural similarity index (SSIM) and qualitatively by two neuroradiologists using a four-point Likert scale. The clinical value of combining synthetic CBV maps and standard MRI scans of brain tumors was assessed in several clinical scenarios (tumor grading, prognosis prediction, differential diagnosis) using multicenter data sets (four external and one internal). Differences in diagnostic and predictive accuracy were tested using the z test.Results: The three-dimensional encoder-decoder network with T1weighted images, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps as the input achieved the highest synthetic performance (SSIM, 86.29% +/- 4.30). The mean qualitative score of the synthesized CBV maps by neuroradiologists was 2.63. Combining synthetic CBV with standard MRI improved the accuracy of grading gliomas (standard MRI scans area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.707; standard MRI scans with CBV maps AUC, 0.857; z = 15.17; P < .001), prediction of prognosis in gliomas (standard MRI scans AUC, 0.654; standard MRI scans with CBV maps AUC, 0.793; z = 9.62; P < .001), and differential diagnosis between tumor re-currence and treatment response in gliomas (standard MRI scans AUC, 0.778; standard MRI scans with CBV maps AUC, 0.853; z = 4.86; P < .001) and brain metastases (standard MRI scans AUC, 0.749; standard MRI scans with CBV maps AUC, 0.857; z =6.13; P < .001).Conclusion: GAN image-to-image translation techniques produced accurate synthetic CBV maps from standard MRI scans, which could be used for improving the clinical evaluation of brain tumors.

N2  -  Subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (sVCI) is caused by lacunar infarcts or extensive and/or diffuse lesions in the white matter that may disrupt the white matter circuitry connecting cortical and subcortical regions and result in the degeneration of neurons in these regions. This study used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques to examine cortical thickness, subcortical shapes, and white matter integrity in mild vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND Mild) and moderate-to-severe VCI (MSVCI). Our study found that compared to controls (n = 25), VCIND Mild (n = 25), and MSVCI (n = 30) showed thinner cortex predominantly in the frontal cortex. The cortex in MSVCI was thinner in the parietal and lateral temporal cortices than that in VCIND Mild. Moreover, compared to controls, VCIND Mild and MSVCI showed smaller shapes (i.e., volume reduction) in the thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus and ventricular enlargement. Finally, compared to controls, VCIND Mild, and MSVCI showed an increased mean diffusivity in the white matter, while decreased generalized fractional anisotropy was only found in the MSVCI subjects. The major axonal bundles involved in the white matter abnormalities were mainly toward the frontal regions, including the internal capsule/corona radiata, uncinate fasciculus, and anterior section of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and were anatomically connected to the affected cortical and subcortical structures. Our findings suggest that abnormalities in cortical, subcortical, and white matter morphology in sVCI occur in anatomically connected structures, and that abnormalities progress along a similar trajectory from the mild to moderate and severe conditions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND
It is well known in the literature that Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) obtained during diffusion-weighted MRI of brain is sensitive in detecting and differentiating low-grade and aggressive meningiomas. However, other studies establish no correlation between mean-ADC and ultimate classification as benign, atypical or malignant. We wanted to assess the correlation between, A. mean of MRI Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (mean-ADC) and B. meningioma biomarker Ki-67 proliferation index, in cases of both low-grade and aggressive meningioma. We also wanted to assess the sensitivity of mean-ADC for diagnosing an aggressive meningioma.; METHODS; We analysed 66 surgically treated meningioma patients with complete histopathology report (HPR) in Government Medical College, Kozhikode during the period of study (Nov-2017-Oct-2018), also having a pre-operative mean-ADC value during Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) investigation at the same centre. For the latter, a standard MRI brain protocol including diffusion imaging was conducted and ADC map was generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn within the tumour on ADC map and mean-ADC values were measured.; RESULTS; Using Pearson correlation coefficient, we found a significant negative correlation between Ki-67 proliferation index and mean-ADC in meningioma cases. We also calculate 0.79 x 10(-3) mm(2)s being a reasonable mean-ADC cut-off value due to its sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 77% in differentiating between typical and atypical meningiomas.; CONCLUSIONS; The non-invasive calculation of mean-ADC is a valid diagnostic tool. Further, mean ADC can be used as a good test to differentiate typical and atypical meningiomas. The latter is a particularly valid conclusion, since there were few results from conventional MRI studies to differentiate between various typical and atypical meningiomas.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate incidence of clinically silent and clinically apparent embolic cerebral infarction following diagnostic and interventional coronary angiography and associated risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the research ethics committee of University of Heidelberg, Germany. Fifty-two patients, including 37 men (mean age, 66.1 years +- 11.9 standard deviation) and 15 women (mean age, 65.3 years +- 10.3), undergoing elective cardiac catheterization were examined 3-26 hours (mean, 15.3 hours +- 6) before and 12-48 hours (mean, 25.9 hours +- 10.4) after cardiac catheterization. Magnetic resonance imaging protocol included isotropic and anisotropic diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar sequences. T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences also were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated to exclude false-positive reading results on diffusion-weighted images because of T2 shine-through effect. Images were assessed by two experienced radiologists blinded to clinical data. Cardiac catheterization was performed by I I experienced cardiologists to exclude operator-related risk. A neurologic examination according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Barthel index was performed by a senior cardiologist before acquisition of each image. Sixteen clinical and angiographic variables were analyzed with univariate analysis for ability to predict occurrence of cerebral infarction.; RESULTS: No embolic cerebral lesions could be detected at diffusion-weighted imaging before catheterization. After coronary angiography, seven (15%) of 48 patients demonstrated nine focal cerebral infarcts affecting anterior and posterior circulation. Patients remained asymptomatic. Of all tested variables, only duration of the procedure was identified as an independent predictor of occurrence of cerebral infarction (P <.05).; CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, asymptomatic cerebral infarction following cardiac catheterization occurred in 15% of patients in whom duration of the procedure was significantly longer than in those without infarction (P =.017).

N2  -  Purpose The peritumoral region (PTR) in glioblastoma (GBM) represents a combination of infiltrative tumor and vasogenic edema, which are indistinguishable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We developed a radiomic signature by using imaging data from low grade glioma (LGG) (marker of tumor) and PTR of brain metastasis (BM) (marker of edema) and applied it on the GBM PTR to generate probabilistic maps.
Methods 270 features were extracted from T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps in over 3.5 million voxels of LGG (36 segments) and BM (45 segments) scanned in a 1.5T MRI. A support vector machine classifier was used to develop the radiomics model from approximately 50% voxels (downsampled to 10%) and validated with the remaining. The model was applied to over 575,000 voxels of the PTR of 10 patients with GBM to generate a quantitative map using Platt scaling (infiltrative tumor vs. edema).; Results The radiomics model had an accuracy of 0.92 and 0.79 in the training and test set, respectively (LGG vs. BM). When extrapolated on the GBM PTR, 9 of 10 patients had a higher percentage of voxels with a tumor-like signature over radiological recurrence areas. In 7 of 10 patients, the areas under curves (AUC) were > 0.50 confirming a positive correlation. Including all the voxels from the GBM patients, the infiltration signature had an AUC of 0.61 to predict recurrence.; Conclusion A radiomic signature can demarcate areas of microscopic tumors from edema in the PTR of GBM, which correlates with areas of future recurrence.; GRAPHICS; .

N2  -  Purpose To develop a near-silent and distortionless DWI (sd-DWI) sequence using magnetization-prepared rotating ultrafast imaging sequence. Methods A rotating ultrafast imaging sequence was modified with driven-equilibrium diffusion preparation, including eddy-current compensation methods. To compensate for the T-1 recovery during readout, a phase-cycling method was used. Both compensation methods were validated in phantoms. The optimized sequence was compared with an EPI diffusion sequence for image distortion, contrast, ADC, and acoustic noise level in phantoms. The sequence was evaluated in 1 brain volunteer, 5 prostate volunteers, and 10 pediatric patients with joint diseases. Results Combination of several eddy-current compensation methods reduced the artifact to an acceptable level. Phase cycling reduced T-1 recovery contamination during readout. In phantom scans, the optimized sequence generated similar image contrast to the EPI diffusion sequence, and ADC maps between the sequences were comparable; sd-DWI had significantly lower acoustic noise (P < .05). In vivo brain scan showed reduced image distortion in sd-DWI compared with the EPI diffusion, although residual motion artifact remains due to brain pulsation. The prostate scans showed that sd-DWI can provide similar ADC compared with EPI diffusion, with no image distortion. Patient scans showed that the sequence can clearly depict joint lesions. Conclusion An sd-DWI sequence was developed and optimized. Compared with conventional EPI diffusion, sd-DWI provided similar diffusion contrast, accurate ADC measurement, improved image quality, and minimal ambient scanning noise. The sequence showed the ability to obtain in vivo diffusion contrast in relatively motion-free body regions, such as prostate and joint.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 25 patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in DTI measures during the evolutionary course of NCC lesions from vesicular to calcified stage in the brain. DTI measures were quantified from the NCC lesions of all patients. On the basis of conventional imaging findings, NCC lesions were classified into vesicular, vesicular colloidal, granular nodular and calcified stages. Significant inverse correlation was observed between the evolutionary stage of NCC lesion and mean diffusivity (MD; r=-0.748, P<0.001) and spherical anisotropy (CS; r=-0.585, P<.001) values. Significant direct correlations were observed between evolutionary stages of NCC lesion and mean fractional anisotropy (FA; r=0.575, P<0.001), linear anisotropy (CL; r=0.478, p<0.001) and planar anisotropy (CP; r=0.561, p<0.001) values. Successive decrease in MD values calculated from NCC lesions was observed, moving from vesicular to granular nodular stage. On FA, CL and CP maps, a significant increase in signal intensity value was observed in calcified as compared to other stages. We conclude that DTI measures may indicate the evolutionary changes in NCC from vesicular to calcified stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective
Here, we retrospectively investigate the value of voxel-wisely plotted diffusion tensor-derived (DTI) axial, radial and mean diffusivity for the early detection of malignant transformation (MT) in WHO II glioma compared to contrast-enhanced images.; Materials and Methods; Forty-seven patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging follow-up between 2006-2014 after gross-tumor resection of intra-axial WHO II glioma. AxialMeanRadial diffusivity maps (ADMDRD) were generated from DTI data. AD(min)MDminRDmin values were quantified within tumor regions-of-interest generated by two independent readers including tumor contrast-to-noise (CNR). Sensitivityspecificity and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were calculated using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Inter-reader agreement was assessed (Cohen's kappa). Results; Eighteen patients demonstrated malignant transformation (MT) confirmed in 818 by histopathology and in 1018 through imaging follow-up. Twelve of 18 patients (66.6%) with MT showed diffusion restriction timely coincidental with contrast-enhancement (CE). In the remaining six patients (33.3%), the diffusion restriction preceded the CE. The mean gain in detection time using DTI was (0.8 +- 0.5 years, p = 0.028). Compared to MDmin and RDmin, ROC-analysis showed best diagnostic value for AD(min) (sensitivityspecificity 94.94%89.7%, AUC 0.96; p<0.0001) to detect MT. CNR was highest for AD (1.83 +- 0.14), compared to MD (1.31 +- 0.19; p<0.003) and RD (0.90 +- 0.23; p<0.0001). Cohen's Kappa was 0.77 for AD(min), 0.71 for MDmin and 0.65 for RDmin (p<0.0001, respectively).; Conclusion; MT is detectable at the same time point or earlier compared to T1w-CE by diffusion restriction in diffusion-tensor-derived maps. AD demonstrated highest sensitivityspecificity tumor-contrast compared to radial or mean diffusivity (= apparent diffusion coefficient) to detect MT.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the capacity of multimodal MR to detect endothelial hyperplasia (EH), which has been linked to the aggressiveness of gliomas and which is so far only detected by biopsy, an invasive technique that prevents repeated measurements and early detection.
Materials and Methods: A total of 26 patients with low-grade ghomas participated in the study. All underwent a histopathological analysis and a multimodal MR examination (spectroscopic, anatomic, diffusion, perfusion, and postcontrast imaging); Results: EH was present (EH+) in 15 patients and absent (EH-) in 11. No differences were observed between EH- and EH+ groups when comparing spectroscopic and diffusion parameters. Perfusion measurements, however, allowed us to distinguish EH+ from EH-: the relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was found equal to 3.23 +- 2.05 for EH+ and 1.33 +- 0.46 for EH- (P = 0.006).; Conclusion: We have observed a strong correlation between the presence of EH and the increase of rCBF. Compared to conventional imaging, MR perfusion provides additional and complementary information that may be used for biopsy guidance, early detection of tumor aggressiveness, and noninvasive follow-ups.

N2  -  Background Resent advances on functional mapping have enabled us to conduct surgery on gliomas within the eloquent area. The objective of the article is to discuss the feasibility of a planned fractionated strategy of resection on low-grade gliomas (LGGs) involving Broca's area. We report the first surgical series of planned fractionated resections on LGGs within Broca's area, focusing on language functional reshaping.
Methods Four patients were treated with fractionated operations for LGGs involving Broca's area. All cases underwent conventional magnetic resonance (MR) scanning, language functional MR and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before operation. The resections were then performed on patients under awake anesthesia using intraoperative electrical stimulation (IES) for functional mapping. Pre- and post-operative neuro-psychological examinations were evaluated.; Results Total resections were achieved in all cases as confirmed by the postoperative control MR. After transient language worsening, all patients recovered to normal 3-6 months later. Language functional MR scannings have shown language functional cortical and subcortical pathway reorganization (in the perilesion or contra-lateral hemisphere) after the operation. All patients returned to a normal socioprofessional life.; Conclusions By utilizing the dynamic interaction between brain plasticity and fractionated resections, we can totally remove the tumor involving Broca's structure without inducing permanent postoperative deficits and even improve the quality of life.

N2  -  Neurokinin B (NKB) belongs to the family of neuropeptides named tachykinins. Members of this family such as substance P or neurokinin A have been proposed to function as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Searching for possible sites of action of NKB in the central nervous system, we have now investigated its distribution within the rat brain by immunohistochemical techniques and in situ hybridization. For immunohistology two different antisera directed against amino acid sequences within preprotachykinin B were used. One antiserum had been raised against a synthetic derivative of NKB; the other one was directed towards the amino acids 50-79 of preprotachykinin B, which are referred to as peptide 2.
Essentially the same distribution of immunoreactive perikarya was obtained with both antisera and it closely corresponded to the cellular localization of preprotachykinin B mRNA. Neurons containing NKB immunoreactivity and mRNA were present in many areas including cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdaloid complex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventral pallidum, habenula, medial preoptic area, arcuate nucleus, and lateral mammillary bodies. Dense immunoreactive fibers were observed in various parts of the brain and were most prominent in the olfactory bulb and tubercle, the lateral olfactory tract, medial hypothalamus, around blood vessels of the median eminence and interpeduncular nucleus, amygdaloid nuclei, stria terminalis, subbrachial nucleus, and medial geniculate nucleus. Fibers of less intense staining were seen among other brain areas in the substantia nigra, the reticular formation, and the area of the nucleus of the solitary tract. Surgical lesion of the fasciculus retroflexus revealed that the dense fiber network observed in the interpeduncular nucleus originates from the ventral and dorsal parts of the medial habenula. Our data suggest a widespread and distinct distribution of neurons expressing NKB within the central nervous system, suggesting possible neuromodulatory roles of this neuropeptide for various brain functions.

N2  -  ObjectiveTo assess the role of the superior longitudinal fascicle, the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, and the posterior parietal lobe in visuospatial attention in humans during awake brain surgery.
Experimental designSeven patients with hemispheric gliomas (six in the right hemisphere) entered the study. During surgery in asleepawake anesthesia, guided by Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fiber Tractography, visuospatial neglect was assessed during direct electrical stimulation by computerized line bisection.; Principal observationsA rightward deviation, indicating left visuospatial neglect, was induced in six of seven patients by stimulation of the parietofrontal connections, in a location consistent with the trajectory of the second branch of the superior longitudinal fascicle. Stimulation of the medial and dorsal white matter of the superior parietal lobule (corresponding to the first branch of the superior longitudinal fascicle), of the ventral and lateral white matter of the supramarginal gyrus (corresponding to the third branch of the superior longitudinal fascicle), and of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, was largely ineffective. Stimulation of the superior parietal lobule (Brodmann's area 7) caused a marked rightward deviation in all of the six assessed patients, while stimulation of Brodmann's areas 5 and 19 was ineffective.; ConclusionsThe parietofrontal connections of the dorso-lateral fibers of the superior longitudinal fascicle (i.e., the second branch of the fascicle), and the posterior superior parietal lobe (Brodmann's area 7) are involved in the orientation of spatial attention. Spatial neglect should be assessed systematically during awake brain surgery, particularly when the right parietal lobe may be involved by the neurosurgical procedure.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The objectives of the present study were to: (1) noninvasively identify white matter reorganization and monitor its progress within 6 weeks after the onset of stroke; and (2) quantitatively investigate the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin treatment on this structural change using in vivo measurement of diffusion anisotropy.
Methods-Male Wistar rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with recombinant human erythropoietin intraperitoneally at a dose of 5000 Ukg of body weight (n = 11) or the same volume of saline (n = 7) daily for 7 days starting 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. MRI measurements of T2- and diffusion-weighted images and cerebral blood flow were performed and neurological severity score was assessed at 1 day and weekly for 6 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Luxol fast blue and Bielschowsky staining were used to demonstrate myelin and axons, respectively.; Results-White matter reorganization occurred along the ischemic lesion boundary after stroke. The region of white matter reorganization seen on the tissue slice coincided with the elevated area on the fractional anisotropy map, which can be accurately identified. The increase in elevated fractional anisotropy pixels corresponded with progress of white matter reorganization and was associated with improvement of neurological function. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin after stroke significantly enhanced white matter reorganization, restored local cerebral blood flow, and expedited functional recovery.; Conclusions-White matter reorganization can be detected by fractional anisotropy. Elevated fractional anisotropy pixels may be a good MRI index to stage white matter remodeling and predict functional outcome. (Stroke. 2009; 40: 936-941.)

N2  -  The distribution of degenerating axons and terminals was mapped following the placement of small electrolytic lesions within the accumbens. Quantitatively, the majority of accumbens efferent fibers appear to terminate in the diencephalon, while there are also projections to cortical and brain stem structures. The nucleus accumbens apparently sends efferent fibers to the cingulum, lateral hypothalamus, globus pallidus, thalamus (including the reuniens, gelatinosus, parataenial, medial and anteromedial nuclei) and the substantia nigra.

N2  -  A novel approach based on diffusion tractography was used here to characterise the cortico-thalamic connectivity in two patients, both presenting with an isolated bilateral infarct in the thalamus, but exhibiting partially different cognitive and behavioural profiles. Both patients (G. P. and R. F.) had a pervasive deficit in episodic memory, but only one of them (R. F.) suffered also from a dysexecutive syndrome. Both patients had an MRI scan at 3T, including a T1-weighted volume. Their lesions were manually segmented. T1-volumes were normalised to standard space, and the same transformations were applied to the lesion masks. Nineteen healthy controls underwent a diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scan. Their DTI data were normalised to standard space and averaged. An atlas of Brodmann areas was used to parcellate the prefrontal cortex. Probabilistic tractography was used to assess the probability of connection between each voxel of the thalamus and a set of prefrontal areas. The resulting map of corticothalamic connections was superimposed onto the patients' lesion masks, to assess whether the location of the thalamic lesions in R.F. (but not in G. P.) implied connections with prefrontal areas involved in dysexecutive syndromes. In G.P., the lesion fell within areas of the thalamus poorly connected with prefrontal areas, showing only a modest probability of connection with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Conversely, R.F.'s lesion fell within thalamic areas extensively connected with the ACC bilaterally, with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and with the left supplementary motor area. Despite a similar, bilateral involvement of the thalamus, the use of connectivity-based segmentation clarified that R.F.'s lesions only were located within nuclei highly connected with the prefrontal cortical areas, thus explaining the patient's frontal syndrome. This study confirms that DTI tractography is a useful tool to examine in vivo the effect of focal lesions on interconnectivity brain patterns.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the modern radiation therapy (RT) workflow. In comparison with computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is the dominant imaging modality in RT, MRI possesses excellent soft-tissue contrast for radiographic evaluation. Based on quantitative models, MRI can be used to assess tissue functional and physiological information. With the developments of scanner design, acquisition strategy, advanced data analysis, and modeling, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), a combination of morphologic and functional imaging modalities, has been increasingly adopted for disease detection, localization, and characterization. Integration of mpMRI techniques into RT enriches the opportunities to individualize RT. In particular, RT response assessment using mpMRI allows for accurate characterization of both tissue anatomical and biochemical changes to support decision-making in monotherapy of radiation treatment and/or systematic cancer management. In recent years, accumulating evidence have, indeed, demonstrated the potentials of mpMRI in RT response assessment regarding patient stratification, trial benchmarking, early treatment intervention, and outcome modeling. Clinical application of mpMRI for treatment response assessment in routine radiation oncology workflow, however, is more complex than implementing an additional imaging protocol; mpMRI requires additional focus on optimal study design, practice standardization, and unified statistical reporting strategy to realize its full potential in the context of RT. In this article, the mpMRI theories, including image mechanism, protocol design, and data analysis, will be reviewed with a focus on the radiation oncology field. Representative works will be discussed to demonstrate how mpMRI can be used for RT response assessment. Additionally, issues and limits of current works, as well as challenges and potential future research directions, will also be discussed.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEExamining how left-hemisphere brain tumors might impact both the microstructure of the corpus callosum (CC) as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) values in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as well as cortical language lateralization measured with functional MRI (fMRI).
METHODSfMRI tasks (phonemic fluency and verb generation) were performed in order to detect activation in Broca's and Wernicke's area. Twenty patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors were investigated. fMRI results were divided into left dominant (LD), right dominant (RD), or codominant (CD) for language function. DTI was performed to generate FA maps in the anterior and posterior CC. FA values were correlated with the degree of language dominance.; RESULTSPatients who were LD or RD for language in Broca's area had lower FA in the anterior CC than those who were CD for language (median for CD = .72, LD = .66, RD = .65, P < .09). Lateralized versus CD group level analysis also showed that CD patients had higher FA in the anterior CC than patients who displayed strong lateralization in either hemisphere (median for CD = .72, lateralized = .65, P < .05).; CONCLUSIONOur preliminary observations indicate that the greater FA in CD patients may reflect a more directional microstructure for the CC in this region, suggesting a greater need for interhemispheric transfer of information. Because brain tumors can cause compensatory codominance, our findings may suggest a mechanism by which interhemispheric transfer is facilitated during plasticity in the presence of a tumor.

N2  -  Background Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with m.3243A > G mutation usually develop in the cerebral cortex. Few reports have documented SLEs in the cerebellum. The clinical neuroimaging features of cerebellar SLEs have not been fully investigated. We report distinctive features of cerebellar stroke-like lesions (SLLs) in a case of MELAS with m.3243A > G mutation. Case presentation A 47-year-old Japanese man with type-2 diabetes presented to our hospital with acute onset of aphasia. A brain MRI obtained on admission (day 1) showed increased diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the left anterolateral temporal lobe, which subsequently spread along the cortex posteriorly accompanied by a new lesion in the right anterior temporal lobe. The patient was initially treated with acyclovir and subsequently with immunotherapy. However, on day 45, cerebellar ataxia developed. The brain MRI showed extensive increased DWI/FLAIR signals in the cerebellum along the folia without involvement of deep cerebellar nucleus or cerebellar peduncle; SLLs were incongruent with a vascular territory, similarly to classic cerebral SLLs. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map did not show reduction in ADC values in the affected folia. Genomic analysis revealed m.3243A > G mutation (heteroplasmy in leukocytes, 17%), confirming the diagnosis of MELAS. After the treatment with taurine (12,000 mg/day), L-arginine (12,000 mg/day), vitamin B1 (100 mg/day), and carnitine (3000 mg/day), the patient became able to follow simple commands, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation center on day 146. The follow-up MRI showed diffuse brain atrophy, including the cerebellum. Conclusions SLLs develop in the cerebellum in MELAS with m.3243A > G mutation. The neuroimaging similarities to cerebral SLLs suggest the presence of the common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying both SLEs, which include microangiopathy and increased susceptibility of the cortex to metabolic derangements.

N2  -  Improved therapeutic assessment of experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), would immensely benefit its therapeutic management. Neurometabolite patterns at injury site, measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) after MSCs transplantation, may serve as a bio-indicator of the recovery mechanism. This study used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and1H-MRSto evaluate the therapeutic prospects of implanted MSCsat injury site in experimental mice longitudinally up to 21 days. Negative tissue contrast and cytotoxic edema formation were observed in susceptibility-based contrast (T2*) and an apparent diffusion coefficient map, respectively. Lesion site showed decreased N-acetylaspartate, total choline, myo-inositol, total creatine, glutamate-glutamine complex, and taurine neurometabolic concentrations by 1H-MRS investigation. There was a considerable decrease in locomotor activity, depression index, and cognitive index after TBI. It may, therefore, be inferred that MSC transplantation prompted recovery by decreasing negative signals and edema, restoring metabolites to baseline concentrations, and enhancing behavioral activity. Overall findings support the potential of MSC transplantation for the enhancement of endogenous neuroprotective responses, which may provide future clinical applications for translating laboratory research into therapeutic clinical advances.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differentiation of pilocytic astrocytomas and high-grade astrocytomas is sometimes difficult. There are limited comparisons in the literature of the advanced MR imaging findings of pilocytic astrocytomas versus high-grade astrocytomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the MR imaging, PWI, DWI, and MR spectroscopy characteristics of pilocytic astrocytomas compared with high-grade astrocytomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with pilocytic astrocytomas and 22 patients with high-grade astrocytomas (8-66 years of age; mean, 36 +- 17 years) were evaluated by using a 1.5T MR imaging unit. MR imaging, PWI, DWI, and MR spectroscopy were used to determine the differences between pilocytic astrocytomas and high-grade astrocytomas. The sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of all analyzed parameters at respective cutoff values were determined.; RESULTS: The relative cerebral blood volume values were significantly lower in pilocytic astrocytomas compared with the high-grade astrocytomas (1.4 +- 0.9 versus 3.3 +- 1.4; P = .0008). The ADC values were significantly higher in pilocytic astrocytomas compared with high-grade astrocytomas (1.5 X 10(-3) +- 0.4 versus 1.2 X 10(-3) +- 0.3; P = .01). The lipid-lactate in tumorcreatine in tumor ratios were significantly lower in pilocytic astrocytomas compared with high-grade astrocytomas (8.3 +- 11.2 versus 43.3 +- 59.2; P = .03). The threshold values >= 1.33 for relative cerebral blood volume provide sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of 100%, 67%, 87%, and 100%, respectively, for differentiating high-grade astrocytomas from pilocytic astrocytomas. The optimal threshold values were <= 1.60 for ADC, >= 7.06 for lipid-lactate in tumorcreatine in tumor, and >= 2.11 for lipid-lactate in tumorlipid-lactate in normal contralateral tissue.; CONCLUSIONS: Lower relative cerebral blood volume and higher ADC values favor a diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma, while higher lipid-lactate in tumorcreatine in tumor ratios plus necrosis favor a diagnosis of high-grade astrocytomas.

N2  -  Intraoperatively acquired diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in cranial tumor surgery are used for early detection of ischemic brain injuries, which could result in impaired neurological outcome and their presence might thus influence the neurosurgeon's decision on further resection. The phenomenon of false-negative DWI findings in intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) has only been reported in single cases and therefore yet needs to be further analyzed. This retrospective single-center study's objective was the identification and characterization of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI with new or enlarged ischemic areas on postoperative MRI (poMRI). Out of 225 cranial tumor surgeries with intraoperative DWI sequences, 16 cases with no additional resection after ioMRI and available in-time poMRI (< 14 days) were identified. Of these, a total of 12 cases showed false-negative DWI in ioMRI (75%). The most frequent tumor types were oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (4 each). In 5/12 cases (41.7%), an ischemic area was already present in ioMRI, however, volumetrically increased in poMRI (mean infarct growth + 2.1 cm(3); 0.48-3.6), whereas 7 cases (58.3%) harbored totally new infarcts on poMRI (mean infarct volume 0.77 cm(3); 0.05-1.93). With this study we provide the most comprehensive series of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI that were not followed by additional resection. Our study underlines the limitations of intraoperative DWI sequences for the detection and size-estimation of hyperacute infarction. The awareness of this phenomenon is crucial for any neurosurgeon utilizing ioMRI.

N2  -  Purpose: Conventional MRI based on contrast enhancement is often not sufficient in differentiating grade II from grade III and grade III from grade IV diffuse gliomas. We assessed advanced MRI, MR spectroscopy and [F-18]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([F-18]-FLT) PET as tools to overcome these limitations.
Methods: In this prospective study, thirty-nine patients with diffuse gliomas of grades II, III or IV underwent conventional MRI, perfusion, diffusion, proton MR spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) and F-18-FLT-PET imaging before surgery. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), ChoCr, NAACr, ChoNAA and FLT-SUV were compared between grades.; Results: ChoCr showed significant differences between grade II and grade III gliomas (p = 0.03). To discriminate grade II from grade IV and grade III from grade IV gliomas, the most relevant parameter was the maximum value of F-18-FLT uptake FLTmax (respectively, p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001). The parameter showing the best correlation with the grade was the mean value of F-18-FLT uptake FLTmean (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.0001) and FLTmax (R-2 = 0.5, p < 0.0001).; Conclusion: Whereas advanced MRI parameters give indications for the grading of gliomas, the addition of F-18-FLT-PET could be of interest for the accurate preoperative classification of diffuse gliomas, particularly for identification of doubtful grade III and IV gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Lesions in the corticospinal tract above the decussation at the medullary pyramids almost universally produce contralateral deficits. Rare cases of supratentorial lesions causing ipsilateral motor deficits have been reported previously, but only ever found secondary to stroke or congenital pyramidal tract malformations.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of ipsilateral corticospinal tract innervation discovered incidentally with intraoperative monitoring during a microsurgical resection of a vestibular schwannoma. Intraoperative monitoring with electrical transcranial stimulation of the frontal scalp triggered motor-evoked potentials in the ipsilateral arms. The uncrossed pathways were later confirmed with MRI tractography using diffusion tensor imaging.; CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated ipsilateral motor innervation of the corticospinal tract discovered incidentally during a neurosurgical procedure. Given the increasing use of intraoperative monitoring, this case underscores the importance of cautious interpretation of seemingly discordant neurophysiological findings. Once technical issues have been ruled out, ipsilateral motor innervation may be considered as a possible explanation and neurosurgeons should be aware of the existence of this rare anatomic variant.

N2  -  The possible persistence of a microvascular deficit at long time intervals after cerebral ischemia induction is not well established. In rats, we have generated in vivo maps of the regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) at different time intervals after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) with the aim to evaluate the persistence of a rCBV deficit in the damaged area or in the surrounding regions. The rats were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at different time intervals, starting from the first day until three months after ischemia and postmortem histological and ultrastructural correlation was obtained. All MRI experiments were carried out using an imager-spectrometer equipped with a 4.7 Tesla magnet. To produce the susceptibility-weighted rCBV images, a suspension of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (AMI-25) was injected to the rat. In a control group (nonoperated or sham-operated rats), a symmetrical distribution of rCBV values was found between the two hemispheres (differences between left and right cortex below 8%). In the rats with MCAo an evident vascular asymmetry was found 24 h after ischemia (differences between left and right ranging from 22 and 77%) and reduced rCBV values were evident in the ischemic areas. In a time range following the 15th day most of the rats showed a complete recovery of the lesion while only four animals still had a small residual lesion, as probed by T2-weighted (T2W) images. In three of these four cases, the reduction of rCBV in the ipsilateral cortex with respect to the contralateral was greater than 20%. Correlation was found (Y > 0.8) between late rCBV measurement and the initial volume of the lesion (hyperintense region in T2W images). The postmortem measurements correlate much better with the rCBV data than with the T2W ones. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that cortical lesions may result in a deficit of rCBV for long periods and that a mismatch between T2w and rCBV data can be present during the repair process.

N2  -  Background Radiomics refers to the extraction of quantitative information from medical images and is most commonly utilized in oncology to provide ancillary information for solid tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. The traditional radiomic pipeline involves segmentation of volumes of interest with comparison to normal brain. In other neurologic disorders, such as epilepsy, lesion delineation may be difficult or impossible due to poor anatomic definition, small size, and multifocal or diffuse distribution. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease in which brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates multifocal abnormalities with variable imaging and epileptogenic features. Purpose The purpose of this study was to develop a radiomic workflow for identification of abnormal brain regions in TSC, using a whole-brain atlas-based approach with generation of heatmaps based on signal deviation from normal controls. Methods This was a retrospective pilot study utilizing high-resolution whole-brain 3D FLAIR MRI datasets from retrospective enrollment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients and normal controls. Subjects underwent MRI including high-resolution 3D FLAIR sequences. Preprocessing included skull stripping, coregistration, and intensity normalization. Using the Brainnetome and Harvard-Oxford atlases, brain regions were parcellated into 318 discrete regions. Expert neuroradiologists spatially labeled all tubers in TSC patients using ITK-SNAP. The pyradiomics toolbox was used to extract 88 radiomic features based on IBSI guidelines, comparing tuber-affected and non-tuber-affected parenchyma in TSC patients, as well as normal brain tissue in control patients. For model training and validation, regions with tubers from 20 TSC patients and 30 normal control subjects were randomly divided into two training sets (80%) and two validation sets (20%). Additional model testing was performed on a separate group of 20 healthy controls. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) was used to perform variable selection and regularization to identify regions containing tubers. Relevant radiomic features selected by LASSO were combined to produce a radiomic score omega, defined as the sum of squared differences from average control group values. Region-specific omega scores were converted to heat maps and spatially coregistered with brain MRI to reflect overall radiomic deviation from normal. Results The proposed radiomic workflow allows for quantification of deviation from normal in 318 regions of the brain with the use of a summative radiomic score omega. This score can be used to generate spatially registered heatmaps to identify brain regions with radiomic abnormalities. The pilot study of TSC showed radiomic scores omega that were statistically different in regions containing tubers from regions without tubers/normal brain (p < 0.0001). Our model exhibits an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.84) on the testing set, and the best threshold obtained on the training set, when applied to the testing set, allows us to identify regions with tubers with a specificity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.60. Conclusion We describe a whole-brain atlas-based radiomic approach to identify abnormal brain regions in TSC patients. This approach may be helpful for identifying specific regions of interest based on relatively greater signal deviation, particularly in clinical scenarios with numerous or poorly defined anatomic lesions.

N2  -  To investigate the association of the diffusion-weighted MR imaging characteristics of fetal preCG and gestational age. Forty-four fetuses with normal brain MRI findings were included in the study. Gestational ages ranged from 18 to 36 weeks (mean 25.2 weeks). All exams were performed with a 1.5-T scanner using a body array coil during free maternal breathing without sedation. Precentral gyrus was defined as the hyperintense strip anterior to the central sulcus, on the superior section of axial brain images at the level of superior frontal cortex. The presence of preCG hyperintensity was noted as observed/subtle/not observed at different b values (500, 1000 s/mm(2)) and on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and compared to the imaging characteristics of the superior frontal cortex. Precentral gyrus was first detected at 25 weeks as a hyperintense strip on DWI and hypointense strip on ADC maps. Display of preCG b 1000 s/mm(2) images were better than b 500 s/mm(2). Between 25 and 27 weeks, in 40% of fetuses preCG was observed on one hemisphere, and it was evident bilaterally in 60% of cases. Starting from the 28th week, preCG was observed on both hemispheres in 100% of cases. Diffusion weighted imaging helps better understanding of the evolution of fetal preCG. The hyperintense preCG strip starts to appear at 25 weeks, and when interpreting fetal DWI after 28 weeks this may be a sign to be sought for in all fetuses and an indicator for normal development.

N2  -  Background: Intractable epilepsy due to tumors located in highly eloquent brain regions is often considered surgically inaccessible because of a high risk of postoperative neurological deterioration. Intraoperative MRI and functional navigation contribute to overcome this problem. Objectives: To retrospectively investigate the long-term results and impact of functional neuronavigation and 1.5-tesla intraoperative MRI on patients who underwent surgery of tumors associated with epilepsy located close to or within eloquent brain areas. Methods: Nineteen patients (9 female, 10 male, mean age 41.4 +/- 13.4 years, 11 low-grade and 8 high-grade glial tumors) were evaluated preoperatively using BOLD imaging, diffusion-tensor imaging tractography and magnetoencephalography. Functional data were implemented into neuronavigation in this multimodal approach. Results: In 14 of 19 patients (74%), complete resection was achieved, and in 5 patients significant tumor volume reduction was accomplished. Eight of 14(57%) complete resections were achieved only by performing an intraoperative image update. Neurological deterioration was found permanently in 2 patients. After a mean follow-up of 43.8 +/- 23.8 months, 15 patients (79%) became seizure free (Engel class la). Conclusions: Despite the highly eloquent location of tumors causing intractable epilepsy, our multimodal approach led to complete resection in more than two-thirds of patients with an acceptable neurological morbidity and excellent long-term seizure control.

N2  -  A deeper understanding of the role of specific genes, proteins, pathways and networks in health and disease, coupled with the development of technologies to assay these molecules and pathways in patients, promises to revolutionise the practice of clinical medicine. In particular, the discovery and development of novel drugs targeted to disease-specific alterations could benefit significantly from non-invasive imaging techniques assessing the dynamics of specific disease-related parameters. Here we review the application of imaging biomarkers in the management of patients with brain tumours, especially malignant glioma. This first part of the review focuses on imaging biomarkers of general biochemical and physiological processes related to tumour growth such as energy, protein, DNA and membrane metabolism, vascular function, hypoxia and cell death. These imaging biomarkers are an integral part of current clinical practice in the management of primary brain tumours. The second article of the review discusses the use of imaging biomarkers of specific disease-related molecular genetic alterations such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell membrane receptors and signalling pathways. Current applications of these biomarkers are mostly confined to experimental small animal research to develop and validate these novel imaging strategies with future extrapolation in the clinical setting as the primary objective.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To prospectively determine if the degree of acute perfusion or diffusion abnormalities measured prior to treatment onset help predict the evolution of brain infarction on magnetic resonance (MR) images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. On parametric maps obtained in 64 patients (mean age, 64 years 13 standard deviation; 37 men and 27 women) with acute middle cerebral artery infarction, lesion volumetry was performed to determine time to peak, mean transit time, cerebral blood volume, and apparent diffusion coefficient obtained within 3 hours of symptom onset. The infarct lesions were assessed on T2-weighted MR images obtained at follow-up on day 8. Cerebrovascular changes were determined on MR angiograms. Inferential and correlation statistics were used.; RESULTS: A perfusion delay of more than 6 seconds relative to the nonaffected hemisphere on time-to-peak maps helped to predict the lesion volume on T2-weighted images (r = 0.686, P <.001). In contrast, neither the volume nor the degree of the diffusion abnormality helped to predict the infarct volume (r < 0.46). This was because in one subgroup of patients there was an increase and in one subgroup there was a decrease in infarct volume on the T2-weighted images (P <.001). There was a greater prevalence (P < .02) of cerebral artery abnormalities in the patients with larger infarcts. Clinically, the neurologic impairment was more severe (P <.01) and the mean arterial pressure higher (P <.04) in these patients.; CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in acute stroke the severity of the initial ischemic event as determined on time-to-peak maps indicates hemodynamic compromise in addition to internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion, because of abnormalities in other cerebral arteries.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to correlate intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging with classical perfusion-weighted MRI metrics in human gliomas. Parametric images for slow diffusion coefficient (D), fast diffusion coefficient (D*), and fractional perfusion-related volume (f) in patients with high-grade gliomas were generated. Maps of F-p (plasma flow), v(p) (vascular plasma volume), PS (permeability surface-area product), v(e) (extravascular, extracellular volume), E (extraction ratio), k(e) (influx ratio into the interstitium), and t(c) (vascular transit time) from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI were also generated. A region-of-interest analysis on the contralateral healthy white matter and on the tumor areas was performed and the extracted parameter values were tested for any significant differences among tumor grades or any correlations. Only f could be significantly correlated to DSC-derived v(p) and t(c) in healthy brain tissue. Concerning the tumor regions, F-p was significantly positively correlated with D* and inversely correlated with f in DSC measurements. The D*, f, and fxD* values in the WHO grade III gliomas were non-significantly different from those in the grade IV gliomas. There was a trend to significant negative correlations between f and PS as well as between fxD* and k(e) in DCE experiments. Presumably due to different theoretical background, tracer properties and modeling of the tumor vasculature in the IVIM theory, there is no clearly evident link between D*, f and DSC- and DCE-derived metrics.

N2  -  PURPOSENeurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) has recently been developed to overcome diffusion technique limitations in modeling biological systems. This manuscript reports a preliminary investigation into the use ofa singlecolor-coded map to represent NODDI-derived information.
MATERIALS AND METHODSAn optimized diffusion-weighted imaging protocol was acquired in several clinical neurological contexts including demyelinating disease, neoplastic process, stroke, and toxicmetabolic disease. The NODDI model was fitted to the diffusion datasets. NODDI is based on a three-compartment diffusion model and provides maps that quantify the contributions to the total diffusion signal in each voxel. The NODDI compartment maps were combined into a single 4-dimensional volume visualized as RGB image (red for anisotropic Gaussian diffusion, green for non-Gaussian anisotropic diffusion, and blue for isotropic Gaussian diffusion), in which the relative contributions of the different microstructural compartments can be easily appreciated.; RESULTSThe NODDI color maps better describe the heterogeneity of neoplastic as well inflammatory lesions by identifying different tissue components within areas apparently homogeneous on conventional imaging. Moreover, NODDI color maps seem to be useful for identifying vasogenic edema differently from tumor-infiltrated edema. In multiple sclerosis, the NODDI color maps enable a visual assessment of the underlying microstructural changes, possibly highlighting an increased inflammatory component, within lesions and potentially in normal-appearing white matter.; CONCLUSIONThe NODDI color maps could make this technique valuable ina clinicalsetting, providingcomprehensiveand accessible information in normal and pathological brain tissues in different neurological pathologies.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The purpose of this study was to determine whether neuroprotection is feasible without cerebral blood flow augmentation in experimental permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Methods-Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion by the suture occlusion method and were treated 1 hour thereafter with a single 5-minute intravenous infusion of the postsynaptic density-95 protein inhibitor Tat-NR2B9c (7.5 mgkg) or saline (n = 8group). Arterial spin-labeled perfusion-weighted MRI and diffusion weighted MRI were obtained with a 4.7-T Bruker system at 30, 45, 70, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes postmiddle cerebral artery occlusion to determine cerebral blood flow and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, respectively. At 24 hours, animals were neurologically scored (0 to 5), euthanized, and the brains stained with 2-3-5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to ascertain infarct volumes corrected for edema. Additionally, the effects of Tat-NR2B9c on adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels were measured in vitro in neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation.; Results-Final infarct volume was decreased by 30.3% in the Tat-NR2B9c-treated animals compared with controls (P = 0.028). There was a significant improvement in 24 hours neurological scores in the Tat-NR2B9c group compared with controls, 1.8 +- 0.5 and 2.8 +- 1.0, respectively (P = 0.021). Relative to controls, Tat-NR2B9c significantly attenuated diffusion-weighted imaging lesion growth and preserved the diffusion-weighted imagingperfusion-weighted imaging mismatch (ischemic penumbra) without affecting cerebral blood flow in the ischemic core or penumbra. Tat-NR2B9c treatment of primary neuronal cultures resulted in 26% increase in cell viability and 34% greater adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels after oxygen-glucose deprivation.; Conclusions-Preservation of adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels in vitro and neuroprotection in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats is achievable without cerebral blood flow augmentation using a postsynaptic density-95 protein inhibitor.

N2  -  Background. - Differentiation between glioblastoma and brain metastasis may be challenging in conventional contrast-enhanced MRI.
Purpose. - To investigate if perfusion-weighted MRI is able to differentiate glioblastoma from metastasis and, as a second aim was to see if it was possible in the latter group, to predict the primary site of neoplasm.; Material and methods. - Hundred and fourteen patients with newly discovered tumor lesion (76 metastases and 38 glioblastomas) underwent conventional contrast-enhanced MRI including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion sequence. The calculated relative cerebral blood volumes were analyzed in the solid tumor area, peritumoral area, area adjacent to peritumoral area, and normal appearing white matter in contralateral semioval center. The Student t-test was used to detect statistically significant differences in relative cerebral blood volume between glioblastomas and metastases in the aforementioned areas. Furthermore, the metastasis group was divided in four sub groups (lung-, breast-, melanoma-, and gastrointestinal origin) and using one-way ANOVA test. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.; Results. - Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the peritumoral edema was significantly higher in glioblastomas than in metastases (mean 3.2 +- 1.4 and mean 0.9 +- 0.7), respectively, (P < 0.0001). No significant differences in the solid tumor area or the area adjacent to edema were found, (P = 0.28 and 0.21 respectively). There were no significant differences among metastases in the four groups.; Conclusion. - It is possible to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases by measuring the CBV in the peritumoral edema.; It is not possible to differentiate between brain metastases from different primaries (lung-, breast-, melanoma or gastrointestinal) using CBV-measurements in the solid tumor area, peritumoral edema or area adjacent to edema.

N2  -  Introduction. - Neoangiogenesis is a critical feature that can differentiate high-grade from low-grade glioma. Conventional MR imaging does not assess this histological feature accurately. The goal of this study was to evaluate the gain in relative cerebral blood volume measurement using perfusion MRI in the management of cerebral gliomas.
Materials and methods. - Between 1998 and 2001, 32 histologically proven glial tumors were assessed by perfusion MRI using echoplanar imaging (EPI) and gradient-echo techniques. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was measured in all patients and compared to histological data.; Results. - rCBV values were significantly correlated to histological grading in all 32 patients (P < 0.001). Mean rCBV values were 8.74 (+- 3.79) for glioblastomas, 7.37 (+- 2.83) for anaplastic gliomas and 0.84 (+- 0.6 1) for low-grade gliomas. Mean rCBV values were significantly different between low- and high-grade gliomas, making it possible to determine a threshold (2.5-3) that can separate these two types of lesion. In determining the histological grading, rCBV was shown to be significantly more accurate than conventional MRI (P < 0.005).; Conclusion. - Perfusion MRI using the EPI technique reliably assesses tumoral neoangiogenesis in gliomas preoperatively. The specificity and sensitivity of this technique make this radiological modality a valuable tool in the assessment of cerebral gliomas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.

N2  -  Introduction: Cortical and subcortical motor mapping has advanced the notion of maximal safe resection of intra-axial brain tumours, thereby preserving neurological functions as well as improving survival. Despite being an age-old and established neurosurgical procedure across the world, the strategy and techniques involved in motor mapping have a gamut of variation due to a lack of defined standard protocols.Methods: We disseminated a structured survey among focused group of neurosurgeons with established practices involving brain mapping. It consisted of 40 questions, split into five sections assessing the practice description, general approach for motor mapping, preference for asleep versus awake mapping, operative techniques and approach to representative tumor cases. Practice-patterns during primary motor mapping for brain tumours were analysed from responses of 51 neurosurgeons.Results: 60.8 % felt that any lesion even near (without infiltration) was suffice to define "involvement" of the cortical/subcortical motor pathways. 82.4 % felt that motor mapping was necessary for brain tumours involving motor pathways, irrespective of the tumor histology or patient age. 90.2 % opined that tumor location was the predominant factor affecting their choice between awake or asleep mapping. 31.4 % believed that all cases should be performed awake unless patient-related medical, psychological, or anaesthetic contraindications exist, whereas 45.1 % felt that all cases should be performed asleep unless language mapping is required. MRI, DTI -based tractography and intra-operative fluorescence were the most commonly employed surgical adjuncts.Conclusions: The data from this survey may serve as a preliminary foundation for a more standardized approach to patient selection and the approach to motor mapping for brain tumors.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  Glioma-induced aphasia (GIA) is frequently observed in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Previous studies showed an impact of gliomas not only on local brain regions but also on the functionality and structure of brain networks. The current study used navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) to localize language-related regions and to explore language function at the network level in combination with connectome analysis. Thirty glioma patients without aphasia (NA) and 30 patients with GIA were prospectively enrolled. Tumors were located in the vicinity of arcuate fasciculus-related cortical and subcortical regions. The visualized ratio (VR) of each tract was calculated based on their respective fractional anisotropy (FA) and maximal FA. Using a thresholding method of each tract at 25% VR and 50% VR, DTI-based tractography was performed to construct structural brain networks for graph-based connectome analysis, containing functional data acquired by nTMS. The average degree of left hemispheric networks (M-left) was higher in the NA group than in the GIA group for both VR thresholds. Differences of global and local efficiency between 25% and 50% VR thresholds were significantly lower in the NA group than in the GIA group. Aphasia levels correlated with connectome properties in M-left and networks based on positive nTMS mapping regions (M-pos). A more substantial relation to language performance was found in M-pos and M-left compared to the network of negative mapping regions (M-neg). Gliomas causing deterioration of language are related to various cerebral networks. In NA patients, mainly M-neg was impacted, while M-pos was impacted in GIA patients.

T2  -  PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY

N2  -  Imaging plays a fundamental role in the managing childhood neurologic, neurosurgical and neuro-oncological disease. Employing multi-parametric MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, to the radiophenotyping of neuroradiologic conditions is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly with radiogenomic analyses correlating imaging characteristics with molecular biomarkers of disease. However, integration into routine clinical practice remains elusive. With modern multi-parametric MRI now providing additional data beyond anatomy, informing on histology, biology and physiology, such metric-rich information can present as information overload to the treating radiologist and, as such, information relevant to an individual case can become lost. Artificial intelligence techniques are capable of modelling the vast radiologic, biological and clinical datasets that accompany childhood neurologic disease, such that this information can become incorporated in upfront prognostic modelling systems, with artificial intelligence techniques providing a plausible approach to this solution. This review examines machine learning approaches than can be used to underpin such artificial intelligence applications, with exemplars for each machine learning approach from the world literature. Then, within the specific use case of paediatric neuro-oncology, we examine the potential future contribution for such artificial intelligence machine learning techniques to offer solutions for patient care in the form of decision support systems, potentially enabling personalised medicine within this domain of paediatric radiologic practice.

N2  -  Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has developed into a reliable non-invasive clinical and scientific tool over the past decade. Specifically, it has undergone several validating clinical trials that demonstrated high agreement with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES), which paved the way for increasing application for the purpose of motor mapping in patients harboring motor-eloquent intracranial neoplasms. Based on this clinical use case of the technique, in this article we review the evidence for the feasibility of motor mapping and derived models (risk stratification and prediction, nTMS-based fiber tracking, improvement of clinical outcome, and assessment of functional plasticity), and provide collected sets of evidence for the applicability of quantitative mapping with nTMS. In addition, we provide evidence-based demonstrations on factors that ensure methodological feasibility and accuracy of the motor mapping procedure. We demonstrate that selection of the stimulation intensity (SI) for nTMS and spatial density of stimuli are crucial factors for applying motor mapping accurately, while also demonstrating the effect on the motor maps. We conclude that while the application of nTMS motor mapping has been impressively spread over the past decade, there are still variations in the applied protocols and parameters, which could be optimized for the purpose of reliable quantitative mapping.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether cerebral fat embolism demonstrated reversible or irreversible findings in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over time and to compare the features in MR images with histologic findings in a cat model.
Materials and Methods: MR images were obtained serially at 2 hours, 1 and 4 days, and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after embolization with 0.05 mL of triolein into the internal carotid artery in 19 cats. Any abnormal signal intensity and change in the signal intensity were evaluated on T-2-weighted images, T-1-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images (DWIs; including apparent diffusion coefficient ADC maps), and gadolinium-enhanced T-1-weighted images (Gd-T1WI) over time. After MR imaging at 3 weeks, brain tissue was obtained and evaluated for light microscopic (LM) examination using hematoxylin-eosin and Luxol fast blue staining. For electron microscopic examination, the specimens were obtained at the cortex. The histologic and MR findings were compared.; Results: The embolization lesions showed hyperintensity on T-2-weighted images, hyperintensity, or isointensity on DWIs, hypointensity, or isointensity on ADC maps and contrast enhancement on Gd-T1WIs at 2 hours. The T-2-weighted hyperintensity extended to the white matter at day 1 and decreased thereafter. Contrast enhancement decreased continuously from day 1, and hyperintensity on DWI decreased after day 4. Hypointensity on ADC maps became less prominent after day 4. By week 3, most lesions had reverted to a normal appearance on MR images and were correlated with LM findings. However, small focal lesions remained in the gray matter of 8 cats and in the white matter of 3 cats on MR images, and this correlated with the cystic changes on LM findings. Electron microscopic examination of the cortical lesions that reverted to normal at week 3 in MR images showed that most of these lesions appeared normal but showed sporadic intracapillary fat vacuoles and disruption of the endothelial walls.; Conclusions: The embolized lesions of the hyperacute stage were of 2 types: type 1 lesions, showing hyperintensity on DWIs and hypointensity on ADC maps, have irreversible sequelae, such as cystic changes; whereas type 2 lesions, showing isointensity or mild hyperintensity on DWIs and ADC maps, reverted to a normal appearance in the subacute stage.

N2  -  There is a need to develop user-friendly imaging tools estimating robust quantitative biomarkers (QIBs) from multiparametric (mp)MRI for clinical applications in oncology. Quantitative metrics derived from (mp)MRI can monitor and predict early responses to treatment, often prior to anatomical changes. We have developed a vendor-agnostic, flexible, and user-friendly MATLAB-based toolkit, MRI-Quantitative Analysis and Multiparametric Evaluation Routines ("MRI-QAMPER", current release v3.0), for the estimation of quantitative metrics from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and multi-b value diffusion-weighted (DW) MR and MR relaxometry. MRI-QAMPER's functionality includes generating numerical parametric maps from these methods reflecting tumor permeability, cellularity, and tissue morphology. MRI-QAMPER routines were validated using digital reference objects (DROs) for DCE and DW MRI, serving as initial approval stages in the National Cancer Institute Quantitative Imaging Network (NCI/QIN) software benchmark. MRI-QAMPER has participated in DCE and DW MRI Collaborative Challenge Projects (CCPs), which are key technical stages in the NCI/QIN benchmark. In a DCE CCP, QAMPER presented the best repeatability coefficient (RC = 0.56) across test-retest brain metastasis data, out of ten participating DCE software packages. In a DW CCP, QAMPER ranked among the top five (out of fourteen) tools with the highest area under the curve (AUC) for prostate cancer detection. This platform can seamlessly process mpMRI data from brain, head and neck, thyroid, prostate, pancreas, and bladder cancer. MRI-QAMPER prospectively analyzes dose de-escalation trial data for oropharyngeal cancer, which has earned it advanced NCI/QIN approval for expanded usage and applications in wider clinical trials.

N2  -  Purpose: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement.
Materials and Methods: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Fourteen patients were ultimately included. DT MR imaging studies at 3.0 T were performed preoperatively and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated from the DT imaging data sets for all time points in all patients. Voxels where FA consistently decreased over time were identified, and FA change in these voxels was correlated with clinical changes in tremor over the same period by using Pearson correlation.; Results: Ipsilateral brain structures that showed prespecified negative correlation values of FA over time of -0.5 or less included the pre- and postcentral subcortical white matter in the hand knob area; the region of the corticospinal tract in the centrum semiovale, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the cerebral peduncle; the thalamus; the region of the red nucleus; the location of the central tegmental tract; and the region of the inferior olive. The contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral portions of the superior vermis also showed persistent decrease in FA over time. There was strong correlation between decrease in FA and clinical improvement in hand tremor 3 months after lesion inducement (P < .001).; Conclusion: DT MR imaging after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy depicts changes in specific brain structures. The magnitude of the DT imaging changes after thalamic lesion inducement correlates with the degree of clinical improvement in essential tremor.

N2  -  Imaging of the vasculature and its functioning over the entire lesion may significantly aid in cancer diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and therapeutic evaluation. In the current study we present a dynamic three-dimensional deuterium magnetic resonance imaging method that determines the intravascular volume fraction and water perfusion rate at a resolution of 2 mm(2)/pixel. The method was tested and utilized to characterize the vasculature of orthotopic MCF7 human breast cancer tumors in CD1-NU athymic mice. A new algorithm based on Pat-lak's kinetic model was developed to analyze the dynamic images acquired during and after termination of infusion with deuterated water. The resulting parametric maps spanned a wide range from 0.4 to 35.2% for the intravascular volume fraction and from 4 x 10(-6) to 3.9 x 10(-3) min(-1) for the perfusion rate and exhibited high intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity at both parameters. The intravascular volume fraction did not correlate with the corresponding perfusion rate, demonstrating the irregular outgrowth of tumor neovascularization. Averaging the data or analyzing at spatially degraded resolution completely masked the presence of both "hot spots" and hypoxic loci, highlighting the critical importance of high spatial resolution. The method is applicable to other types of tumors and animal models and may be extended to humans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  -  Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that enables in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter connections. White matter parcellation classifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful tracts. It enables quantification and visualization of whole-brain tractography. Currently, most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), whereas fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We propose a novel two-stage deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is adapted to our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers for SWM. We train our model on a large-scale tractography dataset including streamline samples from labeled long-and medium-range (over 40 mm) SWM clusters and anatomically implausible streamline samples, and we perform testing on six independently acquired datasets of different ages and health conditions (including neonates and patients with space-occupying brain tumors). Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation results on all datasets, showing good generalization across the lifespan in health and disease. In addition, the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging can disclose distinct hyperintense lesions in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, these findings and chronologic changes of CJD at diffusion-weighted imaging have not been fully investigated. Our purpose was to assess the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted imaging in depicting CJD-related lesions and in tracking the evolution of these lesions. We also compared the sensitivity of diffusion-weighted imaging in depicting CJD-related lesions to that of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging.
METHODS: We reviewed findings in 13 patients with a diagnosis of CJD who underwent MR imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging. Nine patients were initially examined within 4 months of onset of symptoms (early stage), and eight were examined 4 months or later (late stage). We evaluated four items: 1) distribution of lesions at diffusion-weighted imaging, 2) conspicuity of lesions at diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging, 3) chronologic changes in lesions at diffusion-weighted imaging, and 4) chronologic changes in lesions revealed by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.; RESULTS: Patients had striatal lesions or cerebral cortical lesions or both. The thalamus was involved in only one patient, and the globus pallidus was spared in all patients. The sensitivity of diffusion-weighted imaging in depicting lesions was superior or at least equal to that of FLAIR imaging. Hyperintense lesions at diffusion-weighted imaging changed in extent and intensity over time. Unlike infarction, lesional ADC decreased for 2 weeks or longer.; CONCLUSION: The progressively hyperintense changes in the striata and cerebral cortices at diffusion-weighted imaging are considered characteristic of CJD. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful for the early diagnosis of CJD.

N2  -  High spatial resolution of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging allows characterization of heterogenous tumor microenvironment. Our purpose was to determine which is the best advanced MR imaging protocol, focused on additional MR perfusion method, for predicting recurrent metastatic brain tumor following gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS).
Seventy-two consecutive patients with post-GKRS metastatic brain tumor were enrolled. Two readers independently calculated the percentile histogram cutoffs for normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging and initial area under the time signal-intensity curve (IAUC) from DCE imaging, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and interreader agreement were assessed.; For differentiating tumor recurrence from therapy effect, adding DCE imaging to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) significantly improved AUC from 0.79 to 0.95 for reader 1 and from 0.80 to 0.96 for reader 2, respectively. There was no significant difference of AUC between the combination of DWI with DSC imaging and the combination of DWI with DCE imaging for both readers. With the combination of DWI and DCE imaging, the sensitivity and specificity were 86.7 and 88.1 % for reader 1 and 90.0 and 85.7 % for reader 2, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between readers was highest for calculation of the 90th percentile histogram cutoffs for IAUC (ICC, 0.87).; Adding perfusion MR imaging to DWI significantly improves the prediction of recurrent metastatic tumor; however, the diagnostic performance is not affected by selection of either DSC or DCE MR perfusion method.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is an advanced imaging technique that allows non-invasive evaluation of water diffusibility in brain tissue. The following report focuses on the clinical significance of DWI in stroke and TIA patients
Summary of review: (1) TIA patients demonstrate DWI lesions at a rate of 1 in 6 to 2 in 3. Symptom duration, speech or motor symptoms and aetiology seem to correlate with the rate of DWI positivity (2) In stroke patients, the DWI detection rate of ischaemic lesions is > 95%. Small lesion size and location in the brainstem increase the risk of false-negative DW-images. A negative DW-image in a patient with stroke-like symptoms should stimulate the search for an alternative diagnosis. However, one half of such patients can be expected to have ischaemic stroke as the best final diagnosis. (3) Infarct age determination based on DWI characteristics is not possible in the first few hours. However, the combined interpretation of DWI-images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps enables the distinction of infarcts <= 5 day old from infarcts > 10 days old. On average in DW-images alone, the hyperintense signal disappears after two months. Normalisation can occur as early as one month and as late as four and a half months. (4) DWI lesion size is a prognostic marker of stroke outcome. However, in a mixed stroke population, outcome prediction by DWI. cannot replace clinical outcome scores. (5) The mismatch concept hypothesises that DWI lesions reflect irreversibly infarcted tissue that is surrounded by an area of reduced perfusion. The larger the perfusion-diffusion mismatch the more tissue is potentially salvageable, e.g., by early reperfusion. Although this concept is appealing, more recent data have shown that DWI lesions are not necessarily irreversibly damaged tissue and that perfusion abnormalities tend to overestimate the ischaemic penumbra. More recently, the mismatch between clinical stroke severity as measured with the NIH-stroke Scale Score (NIHSSS) and the volume of DWI lesions has been introduced. (6) In posterior circulation stroke, DWI lesion detection rate is significantly lower than in anterior circulation stroke. (7) DWI features provide important information about stroke aetiology. Multiple DWI lesions in more than one circulation suggest cardioembolism. However, this assignment should be restricted to DWI lesions showing the same appearance on ADC-maps. In patients with lacunar syndromes, every fourth to sixth patient can be expected to have > 1 DWI lesion, indicating an embolic mechanism. Thus, DWI findings may be clinically useful to tailor the aetiological work-up, which may result in early implementation of specific treatment for secondary stroke prevention. (8) DWI may detect clinically silent ischaemic lesions after carotid interventions. A systematic review reported the rate of new DWI lesions as being significantly higher in carotid stenting patients (37%) compared to carotid endarterectomy patients (10%). As caveats, all studies included were non randomized trials. In addition, the clinical significance of these lesions is unclear. Studies, comparing the risk of silent ischaemia in carotid stenting versus endarterectomy patients and evaluating the value of DWI as surrogate marker in a randomised, prospective setting are currently under way.; Conclusion: DWI provides clinically useful information and has the means to improve the quality of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome prediction in stroke and TIA patients.

N2  -  Methotrexate (MTX) is considered the main agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Neurotoxicity is often mild, but severe encephalopathy can develop, especially with intrathecal or intravenous administration. In rare cases, this syndrome has been observed in patients on long-term low-dose oral administration. A 68-year-old male was diagnosed with RA and on treatment with oral MTX 25 mg weekly for 4 years. The patient started with progressive dysarthria, ataxia and cognitive dysfunction. Complementary tests were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintense lesions in both cerebellar hemispheres on T2-weighted and FLAIR images with a diffusion restriction on diffusionweighted imaging (DWI) and on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). On postgadolinium T1-weighted images, there were mild enhancements. Spectroscopy showed a demyelinating pattern. A pharmacogenetics determination was made, showing a heterozygous genotype in the MTHFR and ABCB1 genes. Medication with antirheumatic drug was stopped immediately on admission, and the patient gradually improved. MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy can occur even with low-dose administration. The exact pathogenic mechanism is still unknown, but it is hypothesised that it could be the result of a cumulative toxic effect on the blood-brain barrier. The nature of the relationship between the polymorphism and CNS toxicity is still unclear, and thus, further studies are warranted. Often located in the occipital lobes, the involvement of the cerebellum is quite rare. Early recognition of the condition and withdrawal of the drug lead to a better prognosis.

N2  -  Background: Infratentorial empyema is an uncommon complication of bacterial meningitis. Very little is known about its recognition and appropriate management. Method: We present a patient with infratentorial subdural empyema and compare findings with 41 cases with infratentorial empyema reported in the literature. Results: Many patients with infratentorial empyema presented as subacute meningitis with neck stiffness and decreased consciousness. Diagnosis was often delayed. The minority had cerebellar findings and cranial nerve deficits. Clues to the diagnosis were presence of otitis, sinusitis, or mastoiditis and recent surgery for these disorders. The majority of patients underwent craniotomy; conservative treatment with antibiotics was associated with relapse of symptoms. The mortality rate was high especially in those with subdural empyema. CT failed to clearly visualize infratentorial subdural empyema in several reported Cases. Conclusions: Infratentorial empyema is a life-threatening rare complication of bacterial meningitis. MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging, is the preferred imaging technique in patients with suspected or proven bacterial meningitis and associated ear-nose-throat infection with deterioration in consciousness and neurologic signs that suggest a posterior fossa lesion. Neurosurgery should be regarded as first choice therapy.

N2  -  Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2 alpha (CTLA-2 alpha) is a novel cysteine proteinase inhibitor protein originally discovered and expressed in mouse activated T-cells and mast cells. Expressed recombinant CTLA-2a is shown to exhibit selective inhibition of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases. We have recently reported the expression pattern of CTLA-2a mRNA in mouse brain by in situ hybridization, demonstrating that it is mainly enriched within neuronal populations. In this study we present the distribution profile of the protein by immunohistochemical analysis. Results showed that CTLA-2a protein is preferentially localized in dendritic and axonal compartments. In telencephalon, strong labeling was detected in dendrites in the cerebral cortices, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare and within axonal fibers of stratum lucidum where mossy fibers emanating from all parts of the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus terminate at pyramidal neurons and interneurons. In diencephalon, moderate staining was found in all thalamic nuclei but was strong in medial habenular nucleus and the hypothalamic nuclei including suprachiasmatic nucleus, optic chiasm, arcuate nucleus and median eminence. In mesencephalon, strong immunoreactivity was detected in superior colliculus, inferior colliculus and paramedian raphe nucleus. In the rhombencephalon, the pontine nucleus and transverse fibers of the pons revealed strong staining but were moderate in vestibular nuclei. Strong immunoreactivity was also observed in the internal white matter, granule cell layer and Purkinje cell layer within cerebellum. On Western blot analysis, a band of 14 kDa for CTLA-2 alpha from protein extracts of the cerebrum, cerebellum, pons and medulla was detected. The distribution pattern and functional considerations of CTLA-2 alpha in the brain are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: It has been suggested that a zone of perihematomal ischemia analogous to an ischemic penumbra exists in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Diffusion-perfusion MRI provides a novel means of assessing injury in perihematomal regions in patients with ICH. Objective: To characterize diffusion-perfusion MRI changes in the perihematomal region in patients with hyperacute intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: Twelve patients presenting with hyperacute, primary ICH undergoing CT scanning and diffusion-perfusion MRI within 6 hours of symptom onset were reviewed. An automated thresholding technique was used to identify decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the perihematomal regions. Perfusion maps were examined for regions of relative hypo- or hyperperfusion. Results: Median baseline NIH Stroke Scale score was 17 (range, 6 to 28). Median hematoma volume was 13.3 mL (range, 3.0 to 74.8 mL). MRI detected the hematoma in all patients on echo-planar susceptibility-weighted imaging and in all seven patients imaged with gradient echo sequences. In six patients who underwent perfusion imaging, no focal defects were visualized on perfusion maps in tissues adjacent to the hematoma; however, five of six patients demonstrated diffuse ipsilateral hemispheric hypoperfusion. On diffusion imaging, perihematomal regions of decreased ADC values were identified in three of 12 patients. All three subsequently showed clinical and radiologic deterioration. Conclusions: A rim of perihematomal decreased ADC values was visualized in the hyperacute period in a subset of patients with ICH. The presence of a rim of decreased ADC outside the hematoma correlated with poor clinical outcome. Although perfusion maps did not demonstrate a focal zone of perihematomal decreased blood flow in any patient, most patients had ipsilateral hemispheric hypoperfusion.

N2  -  Background: The prognostic value of the biochemical changes seen with proton MR spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) in ischemic stroke was examined. Acute diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used to identify regions of ischemia for H-1 MRS voxel localization. Methods: Nineteen patients had 36 H-1 MRS studies, 13 patients acutely (mean, 11.1 hours), 10 subacutely (mean, 3.9 days), and 13 at outcome (mean, 82 days). Single-voxel, long-echo, timepoint-resolved spectroscopy was used to obtain lactate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine levels from the infarct core. Outcome measures were final infarct volume and clinical assessment scales (Canadian Neurological Scale, Barthel Index, and Rankin Scale). Results: Acute lactate/choline ratio correlated more strongly with clinical outcome scores (r = 0.76 to 0.83; p < 0.01) and final infarct size (r = 0.96; p < 0.01) than acute DWI lesion volume or acute NAA/choline ratio. Combination of acute lactate/choline ratio with acute DWI lesion volume improved prediction of all outcome scores (R-2 = 0.80 to 0.90). The predictive effect of acute lactate/choline ratio was independent of acute DWI lesion volume (p < 0.001). In subacute and chronic infarction, both lactate/choline and NAA/choline ratios continued to correlate with outcome (p < 0.05). At the chronic stage, persistent lactate/choline ratio elevation strongly correlated with outcome measures (r = 0.71 to 0.87). Conclusion: Lactate/choline ratio measured in the acute infarct core by H-1 MRS improves the prediction of stroke outcome and provides prognostic information complementary to DWI. Lactate/choline ratio could be used as an additional marker to select patients for acute and chronic therapies.

N2  -  Purpose: To present comprehensive examinations of the assumptions made in functional diffusion map (fDM) analyses and provide a biological basis for fDM classification.
Materials and Methods: Sixty-nine patients with gliomas were enrolled in this study. To determine the sensitivity of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) to cellularity, cell density from stereotactic biopsy specimens was correlated with preoperative ADC maps. For definition of ADC thresholds used for fDMs, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for changes in voxel-wise ADC measurements in normal appearing tissue was analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity to progressing disease was examined using both radiographic and neurological criteria.; Results: Results support the hypothesis that ADC is inversely proportional to cell density with a sensitivity of 1.01 x 10(-7) mm(2)snucleimm(2). The 95% CI for white matter = 0.25 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, gray matter = 0.31 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, a mixture of white and gray matter = 0.40 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, and a mixture of white matter, gray matter. and cerebrospinal fluid = 0.75 x 10(-3) mm(2)s. Application of these measurements as ADC thresholds produce varying levels of sensitivity and specificity to disease progression, which were all significantly better than chance.; Conclusion: This study suggests fDMs are valid biomarkers for brain tumor cellularity.

N2  -  Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS) is associated with cognitive disturbances thought to reflect interference between the epileptic focus and brain development. Using diffusion tensor imaging, Ciumas et al. demonstrate abnormal maturation of white matter at the epileptic focus, which correlates with duration of epilepsy and cognitive performance.Benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS) is a unique form of non-lesional age-dependent epilepsy with rare seizures, focal electroencepalographic abnormalities affecting the same well delineated cortical region in most patients, and frequent mild to moderate cognitive dysfunctions. In this condition, it is hypothesized that interictal electroencepalographic discharges might interfere with local brain maturation, resulting in altered cognition. Diffusion tensor imaging allows testing of this hypothesis by investigating the white matter microstructure, and has previously proved sensitive to epilepsy-related alterations of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity. However, no diffusion tensor imaging study has yet been performed with a focus on BCECTS. We investigated 25 children suffering from BCECTS and 25 age-matched control subjects using diffusion tensor imaging, 3D-T-1 magnetic resonance imaging, and a battery of neuropsychological tests including Conner's scale and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (fourth revision). Electroencephalography was also performed in all patients within 2 months of the magnetic resonance imaging assessment. Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy, mean-, radial-, and axial diffusivity were extracted from diffusion tensor imaging data. Patients were compared with control subjects using voxel-based statistics and family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons. Each patient was also compared to control subjects. Fractional anisotropy and diffusivity images were correlated to neuropsychological and clinical variables. Group analysis showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivity in patients compared with control subjects, predominantly over the left pre- and postcentral gyri and ipsilateral to the electroencephalographic focus. At the individual level, regions of significant differences were observed in 10 patients (40%) for anisotropy (eight reduced fractional anisotropy, one increased fractional anisotropy, one both), and 17 (56%) for diffusivity (13 increased, one reduced, three both). There were significant negative correlations between fractional anisotropy maps and duration of epilepsy in the precentral gyri, bilaterally, and in the left postcentral gyrus. Accordingly, 9 of 12 patients (75%) with duration of epilepsy > 12 months showed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy versus none of the 13 patients with duration of epilepsy 12 months. Diffusivity maps positively correlated with duration of epilepsy in the cuneus. Children with BCECTS demonstrate alterations in the microstructure of the white matter, undetectable with conventional magnetic resonance imaging, predominating over the regions displaying chronic interictal epileptiform discharges. The association observed between diffusion tensor imaging changes, duration of epilepsy and cognitive performance appears compatible with the hypothesis that interictal epileptic activity alters brain maturation, which could in turn lead to cognitive dysfunction.
However, such cross-sectional association does not demonstrate causality, and other hitherto unidentified factors could represent the common cause to part or all of the observed findings.

N2  -  Although conventional contrast-enhanced MR imaging remains the standard-of-care imaging method in the posttreatment evaluation of gliomas, recent developments in therapeutic options such as chemoradiation and antiangiogenic agents have caused the neuro-oncology community to rethink traditional imaging criteria. This article highlights the latest recommendations. These recommendations should be viewed as works in progress. As more is learned about the pathophysiology of glioma treatment response, quantitative imaging biomarkers will be validated within this context. There will likely be further refinements to glioma response criteria, although the lack of technical standardization in image acquisition, postprocessing, and interpretation also need to be addressed.

N2  -  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men with a subset inevitably presenting with metastatic disease to the bone. A well-recognized limitation in evaluating new treatments for metastatic PCa is the inability to use imaging to objectively assess response therapy. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of clinically translating the functional diffusion map (fDM) imaging biomarker for quantifying the spatiotemporal effects of bone tumor response in a patient treated for metastatic PCa with bone metastases. A patient beginning therapy was scanned using MRI before treatment and again at 2 and 8 weeks post-treatment initiation to quantify changes in tumor diffusion values. Three metastatic lesions were identified for fDM analysis, all of which all demonstrated an early increase in diffusion values at 2 weeks, which increased further at 8 weeks post-treatment initiation. This finding correlated with a decrease in the patient's prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels suggestive of patient response. CT, bone scans, and anatomic MRI images obtained posttreatment were found to be uninformative for the assessment of treatment effectiveness. This study presents the feasibility of fDM measurements in osseous lesions over time and shows that changes in fDM values were consistent with therapeutic response. Thus, the fDM imaging biomarker may provide a quantifiable therapeutic endpoint to assess response in patients with metastatic bone cancer.

N2  -  According to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS) of 2016, oligodendrogliomas are now defined primarily by a specific molecular signature (presence of IDH mutation and 1p19q codeletion). The purpose of our study was to assess the value of dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging (DSC-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to characterize oligodendrogliomas and to distinguish them from astrocytomas.
Seventy-one adult patients with untreated WHO grade II and grade III diffuse infiltrating gliomas and known 1p19q codeletion status were retrospectively identified and analyzed using relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps based on whole-tumor volume histograms. The Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used to assess the ability of rCBV and ADC to differentiate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas both independently, but also related to the WHO grade. Prediction performance was evaluated in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).; Oligodendrogliomas showed significantly higher microvascularity (higher rCBV(Mean) 0.80, p = 0.013) and higher vascular heterogeneity (lower rCBV(Peak) 0.044, p = 0.015) than astrocytomas. Diffuse gliomas with higher cellular density (lower ADC(Mean) 1094 x 10(-6) mm(2)s, p = 0.009) were more likely to be oligodendrogliomas than astrocytomas. Histogram analysis of rCBV and ADC was able to differentiate between diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II) and anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III).; Histogram-derived rCBV and ADC parameter may be used as biomarkers for identification of oligodendrogliomas and may help characterize diffuse gliomas based upon their genetic characteristics.

N2  -  Background Current demographic trends point towards an aging society entailing increasing occurrence and burden of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, understanding physiological aging and its turning point into neurodegeneration is essential for the development of possible biomarkers and future therapeutics of brain disease. Methods The SENIOR study represents a longitudinal, observational study including cognitively healthy elderlies aged between 50 and 70 years old at the time of inclusion, being followed annually over 10 years. Our multimodal protocol includes structural, diffusion, functional, and sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T and 7 T, positron emission tomography (PET), blood samples, genetics, audiometry, and neuropsychological and neurological examinations as well as assessment of neuronal risk factors. Results One hundred forty-two participants (50% females) were enrolled in the SENIOR cohort with a mean age of 60 (SD 6.3) years at baseline. Baseline results with multiple regression analyses reveal that cerebral white matter lesions can be predicted by cardiovascular and cognitive risk factors and age. Cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with juxtacortical and periventricular lesions. Intra-subject across-test variability as a measure of neuropsychological test performance and possible cognitive marker predicts white matter volume and is significantly associated with risk profile. Division of the cohort into subjects with a higher and lower risk profile shows significant differences in intra-subject across-test variability and volumes as well as cortical thickness of brain regions of the temporal lobe. There is no difference between the lower- and higher-risk groups in amyloid load using PET data from a subset of 81 subjects. Conclusions We here describe the study protocol and baseline findings of the SENIOR observational study which aim is the establishment of integrated, multiparametric maps of normal aging and the identification of early biomarkers for neurodegeneration. We show that intra-subject across-test variability as a marker of neuropsychological test performance as well as age, gender, and combined risk factors influence neuronal decline as represented by decrease in brain volume, cortical thickness, and increase in white matter lesions. Baseline findings will be used as underlying basis for the further implications of aging and neuronal degeneration as well as examination of brain aging under different aspects of brain pathology versus physiological aging.

N2  -  Background and purpose: MRI linear accelerators (MR-Linacs) may allow treatment adaptation to be guided by quantitative MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and precision of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements from DWI on a 1.5 T MR-Linac in patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumours through comparison with a diagnostic scanner.
Materials and methods: CNS patients were treated using a 1.5 T Elekta Unity MR-Linac. DWI was acquired during MR-Linac treatment and on a Philips Ingenia 1.5 T. The agreement between the two scanners on median ADC over the gross tumourclinical target volumes (GTVCTV) and in brain regions (whitegrey matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) was computed. Repeated scans were used to estimate ADC repeatability. Daily changes in ADC over the GTV of high-grade gliomas were characterized from MR-Linac scans.; Results: DWI from 59 patients was analyzed. MR-Linac ADC measurements showed a small bias relative to Ingenia measurements in white matter, grey matter, GTV, and CTV (bias: -0.05 +- 0.03, -0.08 +- 0.05, -0. 1 +- 0.1, -0.08 +- 0.07 mu m(2)ms). ADC differed substantially in CSF (bias: -0.5 +- 0.3 mu m(2)ms). The repeatability of MR-Linac ADC over whitegrey matter was similar to previous reports (coefficients of variation for median ADC: 1.4%1.8%). MR-Linac ADC changes in the GTV were detectable.; Conclusions: It is possible to obtain ADC measurements in the brain on a 1.5 T MR-Linac that are comparable to those of diagnostic-quality scanners. This technical validation study adds to the foundation for future studies that will correlate brain tumour ADC with clinical outcomes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) has been shown to augment diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for the definition of irreversible ischemic injury. However, the complexity of cerebral structure/composition makes the kurtosis map heterogeneous, limiting the specificity of kurtosis hyperintensity to acute ischemia. We propose an Inherent COrrelation-based Normalization (ICON) analysis to suppress the intrinsic kurtosis heterogeneity for improved characterization of heterogeneous ischemic tissue injury. Fast DKI and relaxation measurements were performed on normal (n = 10) and stroke rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (n = 20). We-evaluated the correlations between mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from the fast DKI sequence and relaxation rates R-1 and R-2, and found a highly significant correlation between MK and R-1 (p < 0.001). We showed that ICON analysis suppressed the intrinsic kurtosis heterogeneity in normal cerebral tissue, enabling automated tissue segmentation in an animal stroke model. We found significantly different kurtosis and diffusivity lesion volumes: 147 +/- 59 and 180 +/- 66 mm(3), respectively (p = 0.003, paired t-test). The ratio of kurtosis to diffusivity lesion volume was 84% +/- 19% (p < 0.001, one-sample t-test). We found that relaxation-normalized MK (RNMK), but not MD, values were significantly different between kurtosis and diffusivity lesions (p < 0.001, analysis of variance). Our study showed that fast DKI with ICON analysis provides a promising means of demarcation of heterogeneous DWI stroke lesions.

N2  -  The purposes of this MR-based study were to calculate q-space imaging (QSI)-derived mean displacement (MDP) in meningiomas, to evaluate the correlation of MDP values with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and to investigate the relationships among these diffusion parameters, tumour cell count (TCC) and MIB-1 labelling index (LI).
MRI, including QSI and conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), was performed in 44 meningioma patients (52 lesions). ADC and MDP maps were acquired from post-processing of the data. Quantitative analyses of these maps were performed by applying regions of interest. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for ADC and MDP in all lesions and for ADC and TCC, MDP and TCC, ADC and MIB-1 LI, and MDP and MIB-1 LI in 17 patients who underwent subsequent surgery.; ADC and MDP values were found to have a strong correlation: r = 0.78 (P = < 0.0001). Both ADC and MDP values had a significant negative association with TCC: r = -0.53 (p = 0.02) and -0.48 (P = 0.04), respectively. MIB-1 LI was not, however, found to have a significant association with these diffusion parameters.; In meningiomas, both ADC and MDP may be representative of cell density.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Recent work from our group suggests that human neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (NSC EV) treatment improves both tissue and sensorimotor function in a preclinical thromboembolic mouse model of stroke. In this study, NSC EVs were evaluated in a pig ischemic stroke model, where clinically relevant end points were used to assess recovery in a more translational large animal model.
Methods-Ischemic stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and either NSC EV or PBS treatment was administered intravenously at 2, 14, and 24 hours post-MCAO. NSC EV effects on tissue level recovery were evaluated via magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 84 days post-MCAO. Effects on functional recovery were also assessed through longitudinal behavior and gait analysis testing.; Results-NSC EV treatment was neuroprotective and led to significant improvements at the tissue and functional levels in stroked pigs. NSC EV treatment eliminated intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic lesions in NSC EV pigs (0 of 7) versus control pigs (7 of 8). NSC EV-treated pigs exhibited a significant decrease in cerebral lesion volume and decreased brain swelling relative to control pigs 1-day post-MCAO. NSC EVs significantly reduced edema in treated pigs relative to control pigs, as assessed by improved diffusivity through apparent diffusion coefficient maps. NSC EVs preserved white matter integrity with increased corpus callosum fractional anisotropy values 84 days post-MCAO. Behavior and mobility improvements paralleled structural changes as NSC EV-treated pigs exhibited improved outcomes, including increased exploratory behavior and faster restoration of spatiotemporal gait parameters.; Conclusions-This study demonstrated for the first time that in a large animal model novel NSC EVs significantly improved neural tissue preservation and functional levels post-MCAO, suggesting NSC EVs may be a paradigm changing stroke therapeutic.; Visual Overview-An online visual overview is available for this article.

N2  -  BACKGROUNDMRI signal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in the hippocampus in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA) are resolved within several days after the onset of TGA.
PURPOSETo use multiparametric MRI to unravel the sequelae of TGA.; STUDY TYPEA prospective longitudinal study.; POPULATIONEight TGA patients.; FIELD STRENGTHSEQUENCEA 3.0T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner with T-1-weighted MPRAGE, diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging, and multiecho gradient-recalled echo sequences.; ASSESSMENTBrain MRI scanned within 72 hours, 2 weeks, and 3 months after onset of TGA, respectively. T-1 image hippocampus was first segmented into 12 subregions using FreeSurfer and registered to DWI to locate DWI lesion. Then a T-1 image with segmented hippocampus was registered to its corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, fractional anisotropy (FA) map, and quantitative susceptibility map, respectively. Finally, the volume, water diffusion and anisotropy, and magnetic susceptibility of DWI lesion were analyzed.; STATISTICAL TESTSA paired samples t-test was performed to detect measurement differences between three tests. Pearson correlation was used to assess the correlations between all measurements.; RESULTSHyperintensity was detected in the head, body, and caudate of CA1 and hippocampal tail. No significant changes existed in CA1unit volume across the three timepoint measurements (all, P > 0.480). In Test 1, ratio ADC (DWI lesion  adjacent healthy, rADC) and ratio FA (rFA) decreased below, while ratio susceptibility increased above 1.0. In Test 2, all the episodes normalized around 1.0. In Test 3, rADC remained normalization, but rFA decreased and ratio susceptibility increased again. In Test 1 and Test 3 (vs. Test 2), decreased FA values were accompanied with lower axial diffusivity andor higher radial diffusivity (all, P < 0.001). Moreover, rFA significantly correlated with ratio susceptibility in Test 3 (r=-0.665, P=0.039).; DATA CONCLUSIONMicrostructural sequelae in hippocampus were demonstrated, which indicates that ischemic lesions may be associated with TGA.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of anisotropy in breast tumors are different from normal breast tissue and can improve the discrimination between benign and malignant lesions.
Materials and Methods: The study included 81. women with 105 breast lesions (76 malignant, 29 benign). DTI was performed during breast MRI examinations, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured for breast lesions and normal tissue in each subject. FA and ADC were compared between cancers, benign lesions, and normal tissue by univariate and multivariate analyses.; Results: The FA of carcinomas (mean +- SD: 0.24 +- 0.07) was significantly lower than normal breast tissue in the same subjects (0.29 +- 0.07: P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression showed that FA and ADC were each independent discriminators of malignancy (P < 0.0001), and that FA improved discrimination between cancer and normal tissue over ADC alone. However, there was no difference in FA between malignant and benign lesions (P = 0.98).; Conclusion: Diffusion anisotropy is significantly lower in breast cancers than normal tissue, which may reflect alterations in tissue organization. Our preliminary results suggest that FA adds incremental value over ADC alone for discriminating malignant from normal tissue but does not help with distinguishing benign from malignant lesions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) permit greater visualization and more accurate presurgical planning. Meta-analysis of these techniques for maximizing resection, postoperative functionality, and survival may further validate purported strengths of these techniques compared with standard neuronavigation.
METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines for meta-analysis with the following keywords: "Diffusion tensor imaging" OR "intraoperative MRI" OR "functional MRI" AND "glioma surgery resection outcome." Articles found to meet inclusion criteria were segregated and analyzed and resulting data were compared with standard neuronavigation (control cohort).; RESULTS: A total of 435 articles were identified, with 29 distinct studies meeting inclusion criteria, including DTI (n = 3), fMRI (n = 5), and iMRI (n = 21). Nine studies directly compared results with standard navigation. Mean gross total resection (GTR) rates were not different among cases using DTI, fMRI, iMRI, or traditional neuronavigation (P = 0136). On controlling for covariates, more patients received GTR in the advanced imaging cohort, although statistically insignificant (46.5% 95% confidence interval, 38.0%-55.0% vs. 30.4% 95% confidence interval, 11.6%-49.1%; P = 0127; partial eta(2) = 0.217). Patients undergoing advanced imaging showed attenuated incidence of postsurgical permanent neurologic deficits, although also statistically insignificant (11.3% vs. 13.8%; P = 0.838).; CONCLUSIONS: Current data are overall insufficient to support the notion that advanced imaging techniques are superior, either as a combined cohort or individually, in achieving GTR, improved symptom resolution, or survival compared with traditional neuronavigation.

N2  -  BackgroundPre-eclampsia (PE) is the main cause of death in maternal and prenatal morbidity. No effective clinical tools could be used for the prediction of PE. A radiomics nomogram based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps was established to predict PE from gestational hypertension (GH). Materials and methodsA total of 138 patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were continuously enrolled in the study prospectively, namely, 58 patients with PE and 80 patients with GH. The patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 97) and a test cohort (n = 41). Radiomics features were extracted from DWI and ADC maps. The radiomics signature was constructed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm in the training cohort. A radiomics nomogram was developed by combining the radiomics signature with the selected clinical risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of the radiomics signature, clinical risk factors, and radiomics nomogram were calculated. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomogram. ResultsThe LASSO analysis finally included 11 radiomics features, which were defined as the radiomics signature. The individualized prediction nomogram was constructed by integrating the radiomics signature, maternal age, and body mass index (BMI). The nomogram exhibited a good performance both in the training cohort [AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95)] and test cohort [AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.97)] for predicting PE from GH. The DCA indicated that clinicians and patients could benefit from the use of radiomics nomogram. ConclusionThe radiomics nomogram could individually predict PE from GH. The nomogram could be conveniently used to facilitate the treatment decision for clinicians and patients.

N2  -  AIM: To investigate the immunogenetic properties of glial tumors according to the World Health Organization 2016 glial tumor classification and develop an accurate diagnosis and treatment strategy by comparing preoperative advanced magnetic resonance (aMRI) technique findings of these results.
MATERIAL and METHODS: This study was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery at the Medical Faculty Hospital of Selcuk University between January 1, 2010 and January 4, 2017 and included 50 patients. MR spectroscopy (MRS), MR perfusion (PWI), and MR diffusion (DWI) were performed in 50 patients preoperatively. Patient data were obtained from the hospital's information system. Pathological diagnosis of all patients was taken from the department of pathology at the same medical faculty.; RESULTS: Among the patients included in the study, 11 were grade II (22%), 7 were grade III (14%), and 32 were grade IV (64%). All patients were IDH1 stained: 22 were IDH mutant (44%) and 28 were IDH wild-type (56%). A statistically significant difference in the survival time was observed between IDH mutant and wild-type. IDH-mutant tumors were commonly located in the frontal lobe and IDH wild-type tumors in the parietal and temporal lobes. A significant difference in PWI relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and DWI apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) was noted among grade II, III, and IV tumor groups. The PWI rCBV cut-off value for grade IV tumors was 2.05 (90% sensitivity, 78% specificity). No difference in the ChoCr ratio among grade II, III, and IV tumor groups was noted. A significant difference was noted between the IDH mutant and wild type in terms of PWI rCBV. The PWI rCBV cut-off value of IDH mutant-wild type was 2.15. No difference in the ChoCr, ChoNAA, and DWI apparent diffusion coefficients (p>0.05) was noted between the IDH mutant and wild type.; CONCLUSION: PWI rCBV is the most important prognostic value of aMRI used in tumor grading. PWI rCBV values could be significant in distinguishing IDH wild and mutant.

N2  -  Background: Bevacizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM). Imaging responses are typically assessed by gadolinium-enhanced MRI. We sought to determine the significance of qualitative diffusion signature (manifest as variable degree of dark signal) on ADC maps in recurrent gliomas after treatment with bevacizumab.
Methods: We performed an institutional review board (IRB) approved retrospective study on patients who underwent MRI of the brain after 8 weeks of receiving bevacizumab for recurrent glioma. Patients were divided into three groups based on qualitative diffusion signature: (I) lesion not bright on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) suggestive of no restricted diffusion (FDR0); (II) lesion bright on DWI with corresponding homogenous dark signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps suggestive of focal restricted diffusion likely due to bevacizumab induced necrosis (FDRn); and (III) lesion bright on DWI with corresponding homogenous faint dark signal on ADC maps suggestive of focal restricted diffusion likely due to viable tumor or heterogeneous spectrum of dark and faint dark signals on ADC maps suggestive of focal restricted diffusion likely due to viable tumor surrounding the bevacizumab induced necrosis (FDRt).; Results: Based on the qualitative signal on diffusion weighted sequences after bevacizumab therapy, total number of patients in group (I) were 14 (36%), in group (II) were 17 (44%); and in group (III) were 8 (20%). The median overall survival (OS) from the time of recurrence in patients belonging to group (II) was 364 days vs. 183 days for those with group (I) vs. 298 days for group (III). On simultaneous comparison of survival differences in all three groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis, group (II) was significant in predicting survival with P values for the log-rank tests < 0.033.; Conclusions: In patients with recurrent glioma treated with bevacizumab, the presence of homogenous dark signal (FDRn) on ADC maps at 8 weeks follow-up MRI correlated with a longer survival. Thus, use of this qualitative diffusion signature in adjunct to contrast enhanced MRI may have the widest potential impact on routine clinical care for patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. However, prospective studies analysing its predictive value are warranted.

N2  -  Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (ppMS; n=4) patients and controls (n=4) were examined by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in order to map choline (Cho), creatine and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion constant (ADC). After chemical shift imaging (point-resolved spectroscopy, repetition time/echo time 1,500 ms/135 ms) of a supraventricular volume of interest of 8x8x2 cm(3) (64 voxels) MRS peak areas were matched to the results of DTI for the corresponding volume elements. Mean FA and NAA values were reduced in the ppMS patients (P < 0.01, both) and the ADC increased (P < 0.02). The spatial distribution of NAA showed strong correlation to ADC in both ppMS patients and controls (r =-0.74 and r= -0.70; P < 0.00001, both), and weaker correlations to FA (r=0.49 and r=0.41; P < 0.00001, all). FA and ADC also correlated significantly with Cho in patients and controls (P < 0.00001, all). The relationship of Cho and NAA to the ADC and the FA and thus to the content of neuronal structures suggests that these metabolite signals essentially originate from axons (NAA) and the myelin sheath (Cho). This is of interest in view of previous reports in which Cho increases were associated with demyelination and the subsequent breakdown of neurons.

N2  -  Objective: Neuromyelitis optica and its spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can present similarly to relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Using a quantitative lesion mapping approach, this research aimed to identify differences in MRI brain lesion distribution between aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD and RRMS, and to test their diagnostic potential.
Methods: Clinical brain MRI sequences for 44 patients with aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD and 50 patients with RRMS were examined for the distribution and morphology of brain lesions. T2 lesion maps were created for each subject allowing the quantitative comparison of the 2 conditions with lesion probability and voxel-wise analysis.; Results: Sixty-three percent of patients with NMOSD had brain lesions and of these 27% were diagnostic of multiple sclerosis. Patients with RRMS were significantly more likely to have lesions adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle than patients with NMOSD. Direct comparison of the probability distributions and the morphologic attributes of the lesions in each group identified criteria of "at least 1 lesion adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle and in the inferior temporal lobe; or the presence of a subcortical U-fiber lesion; or a Dawson's finger-type lesion," which could distinguish patients with multiple sclerosis from those with NMOSD with 92% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 98% positive predictive value, and 86% negative predictive value.; Conclusion: Careful inspection of the distribution and morphology of MRI brain lesions can distinguish RRMS and NMOSD.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Retraction-related injury is a recognized complication in neurosurgery. Use of tubular retractors that distribute the pressure on brain tissue was introduced to minimize brain injury. We developed a modified technique using a simple plastic syringe with a Foley catheter to achieve atraumatic cannulation in accessing deep lesions.
METHODS: A retrospective pilot study was conducted to assess safety of the syringe transtubular technique for accessing deep lesions as a cost-effective substitute for commercial brain port methods and to identify retraction-related injury using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging postoperatively. Nine patients were operated on using the syringe technique. Lesions selected were intraparenchymal, deeply located in the supratentorial compartment. Lesions were located in the insula (n = 2), thalamus or basal ganglia (n = 5), subcortical frontoparietal (n = 1) lobe, and right temporal lobe (n = 1). Patients with hematomas, intraventricular lesions, superficially located lesions; pediatric patients less than 12 years old; and patients undergoing redo surgeries were excluded.; RESULTS: Surgical goals were achieved in 8 patients. Three patients had transient deficits; one patient had significant morbidity, which was diagnosed postoperatively as toxoplasmosis. Diffusion restriction was noted in all patients at the surgical cavity but not in the cannulation path.; CONCLUSIONS: Transtubular approaches have a good safety profile and can help achieve surgical goals. Larger studies are needed to compare this approach with other methods, including its effect on hospital stay and survival. The syringe technique is an alternative safe method that can be used in certain neurosurgical centers where commercial tube systems are unavailable.

N2  -  Objectives To evaluate whether amide proton transfer (APT) MRI can be used to characterize gliomas in pediatric patients and whether it provides added value beyond relaxation times. Methods In this prospective study, APT imaging and relaxation time mapping were performed in 203 pediatric patients suspected of gliomas from February 2018 to December 2019. The region of interest (ROI) in the tumor was automatically generated with artifact detection and ROI-shrinking algorithms. Several APT-related metrics (CESTR, CESTRnr, MTRRex, AREX, and APT(#)) and quantitative T1 and T2 were compared between low-grade and high-grade gliomas using the student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. The performance of these parameters was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression model was used to combine the imaging parameters. Results Forty-eight patients (mean age: 6 +/- 4 years; 23 males and 25 females) were included in the final analysis. All the APT-related metrics except APT(#) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher values in the high-grade group than the low-grade group. Under different ROI-shrinking cutoffs, the quantitative T1 (p = 0.045-0.200) and T2 (p = 0.037-0.171) values of high-grade gliomas were typically lower than those of low-grade ones. The stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed that CESTRnr and APT(#) were combined significant predictors of glioma grades (p < 0.05), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.86 substantially larger than those of T1 (AUC = 0.69) and T2 (AUC = 0.68). Conclusions APT imaging can be used to differentiate high-grade and low-grade gliomas in pediatric patients and provide added value beyond quantitative relaxation times.

N2  -  Low-grade gliomas encompass a subgroup of cancerous glial cell growths within the central nervous system and are distinguished by their slow growth and relatively low malignant potential. Despite their less aggressive nature, these tumors can still cause significant neurological symptoms through the compression of surrounding neural and vascular structures and, in some instances, undergo malignant transformation. For these reasons, timely and appropriate evaluation and management of low-grade gliomas is critical. Medical imaging stands as a cornerstone for evaluating patients with lowgrade gliomas because of its noninvasive nature and ability to provide a vast amount of information about the underlying lesion. With the growing number of neuroimaging techniques and their capabilities, there is a lack of clear guidance on which techniques to utilize for the assessment of low-grade gliomas and what their respective core use cases should be. In this literature review, the authors discuss in significant depth the available evidence pertaining to the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques in the evaluation and management of low-grade gliomas. Specifically, they review the specific- ity, sensitivity, accuracy, and use cases of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), perfusion MR imaging (perfusion MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single -photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as well as other emerging imaging techniques. They conclude that most of the advanced neuroimaging techniques are reliable in differentiating lowfrom high-grade gliomas, whereas MRS and DTI may further support molecular subclassification of the tumor. PET has been best employed for the purpose of tumor biopsy, whereas fMRI and DTI can be particularly valuable in preoperative surgical planning, as they delineate the functionally eloquent brain regions that need to be preserved during tumor resection. MRS, PET, SPECT, and perfusion MRI are best suited to monitor tumor progression, as their respective metrics closely correlate with the underlying metabolic activity of the tumor. Together, these techniques offer a vast amount of information and serve as tools for neurologists and neurosurgeons managing patients with low-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Awake craniotomy is the only established way to assess patients' language functions intraoperatively and to contribute to their preservation, if necessary. Recent guidelines have enabled the approach to be used widely, effectively, and safely. Non-invasive brain functional imaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, have been used preoperatively to identify brain functional regions corresponding to language, and their accuracy has increased year by year. In addition, the use of neuronavigation that incorporates this preoperative information has made it possible to identify the positional relationships between the lesion and functional regions involved in language, conduct functional brain mapping in the awake state with electrical stimulation, and intraoperatively assess nerve function in real time when resecting the lesion. This article outlines the history of awake craniotomy, the current state of pre- and intraoperative evaluation of language function, and the clinical usefulness of such functional evaluation. When evaluating patients' language functions during awake craniotomy, given the various intraoperative stresses involved, it is necessary to carefully select the tasks to be undertaken, quickly perform all examinations, and promptly evaluate the results. As language functions involve both input and output, they are strongly affected by patients' preoperative cognitive function, degree of intraoperative wakefulness and fatigue, the ability to produce verbal articulations and utterances, as well as perform synergic movement. Therefore, it is essential to appropriately assess the reproducibility of language function evaluation using awake craniotomy techniques.

N2  -  Neuroimaging studies have allowed for non-invasive mapping of brain networks in brain tumors. Although tumor core and edema are easily identifiable using standard MRI acquisitions, imaging studies often neglect signals, structures, and functions within their presence. Therefore, both functional and diffusion signals, as well as their relationship with global patterns of connectivity reorganization, are poorly understood. Here, we explore the functional activity and the structure of white matter fibers considering the contribution of the whole tumor in a surgical context. First, we find intertwined alterations in the frequency domain of local and spatially distributed resting-state functional signals, potentially arising within the tumor. Second, we propose a fiber tracking pipeline capable of using anatomical information while still reconstructing bundles in tumoral and peritumoral tissue. Finally, using machine learning and healthy anatomical information, we predict structural rearrangement after surgery given the preoperative brain network. The generative model also disentangles complex patterns of connectivity reorganization for different types of tumors. Overall, we show the importance of carefully designing studies including MR signals within damaged brain tissues, as they exhibit and relate to non-trivial patterns of both structural and functional (dis-)connections or activity.
A multimodal MRI study analyzes how signals within brain tumors shape the organization of brain networks and predict surgical outcomes with simple machine learning methods.

N2  -  Background: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a transient clinical and neuroradiologic syndrome caused by cerebral vasogenic edema. Various reversible neurologic symptoms were shown in patients with PRES. Freezing of gait (FOG) is mainly observed in neurodegenerative diseases.
Case presentation: We report a 43-year-old man, with undergoing hemodialysis therapy for chronic renal failure, had mild elevation of blood pressure. His consciousness level suddenly deteriorated, and brain MRI demonstrated hyperintense lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, diffusion-weighted images, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. After improvement of disturbance of consciousness, he showed FOG accompanied by bradykinesia and postural instability. His FOG spontaneously improved concurrently with alleviation of basal ganglionic lesions on follow-up MRI.; Conclusions: It is suggested that vasogenic edema on bilateral basal ganglia associated with PRES can cause acute transient FOG.

T2  -  CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER

N2  -  The current standards in radiotherapy of high-grade gliomas (HGG) are based on anatomic imaging techniques, usually computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The guidelines vary depending on whether the HGG is a histological grade 3 anaplastic glioma (AG) or a grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For AG, T2-weighted MRI sequences plus the region of contrast enhancement in T1 are considered for the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV), and an isotropic expansion of 15 to 20 mm is recommended for the clinical target volume (CTV). For GBM, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group favors a two-step technique, with an initial phase (CTV1) including any T2 hyperintensity area (edema) plus a 20 mm margin treated with up to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a reduction in CTV2 to the contrast enhancement region in T1 with an additional 25 mm margin. The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer recommends a single-phase technique with a unique GTV, which comprises the T1 contrast enhancement region plus a margin of 20 to 30 mm. A total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions is usually delivered for GBM, and a dose of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions is typically given for AG. As more than 85% of HGGs recur in field, dose-escalation studies have shown that 70 to 75 Gy can be delivered in 6 weeks with relevant toxicities developing in < 10% of the patients. However, the only randomized dose-escalation trial, in which the boost dose was guided by conventional MRI, did not show any survival advantage of this treatment over the reference arm. HGGs are amongst the most infiltrative and heterogeneous tumors, and it was hypothesized that the most highly aggressive areas were missed; thus, better visualization of these high-risk regions for radiation boost could decrease the recurrence rate. Innovations in imaging and linear accelerators (LINAC) could help deliver the right doses of radiation to the right subvolumes according to the dose-painting concept. Advanced imaging techniques provide functional information on cellular density (diffusion MRI), angiogenesis (perfusion MRI), metabolic activity and cellular proliferation [positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)]. All of these non-invasive techniques demonstrated good association between the images and histology, with up to 40% of HGGs functionally presenting a high activity within the non-contrast-enhanced areas in T1. New LINAC technologies, such as intensity-modulated and stereotactic radiotherapy, help to deliver a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) > 60 Gy. Trials delivering a SIB into a biological GTV showed the feasibility of this treatment, but the final results, in terms of clinical benefits for HGG patients, are still pending. Many issues have been identified: the variety of MRI and PET machines (and amino-acid tracers), the heterogeneity of the protocols used for image acquisition and post-treatment, the geometric distortion and the unreliable algorithms for co-registration of brain anatomy with functional maps, and the semi-quiescent but highly invasive HGG cells. These issues could be solved by the homogenization of the protocols and software applications, the simultaneous acquisition of anatomic and functional images (PET-MRI machines), the combination of complementary imaging tools (perfusion and diffusion MRI), and the concomitant addition of some ad hoc targeted drugs against angiogenesis and invasiveness to chemoradiotherapy.
The integration of these hybrid data will construct new synthetic metrics for fully individualized treatments.

N2  -  Background Chemo- and radiotherapy (RT) is standard treatment for patients with high-grade glioma, but may cause side-effects on the patient's cognitive function. Aim Use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the longitudinal changes in normal-appearing brain tissue in glioblastoma patients undergoing modern arc-based RT with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or helical tomotherapy. Materials and methods The study included 27 patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma and planned for VMAT or tomotherapy. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging at the start of RT and at week 3, 6, 15, and 26. Fourteen subjects were additionally imaged at week 52. The DTI data were co-registered to the dose distribution maps. Longitudinal changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were assessed in the corpus callosum, the centrum semiovale, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Results Significant longitudinal changes in FA, MD, and RD were mainly found in the corpus callosum. In the other examined brain structures, only sparse and transient changes were seen. No consistent correlations were found between biodose, age, or gender and changes in DTI parameters. Conclusion Longitudinal changes in MD, FA, and RD were observed but only in a limited number of brain structures and the changes were smaller than expected from literature. The results suggest that modern, arc-based RT may have less negative effect on normal-appearing parts of the brain tissue up to 12 months after radiotherapy.

N2  -  Intraoperative MRI (iMRI) made its debut to great fanfare in the mid-1990s. However, the enthusiasm for this technology with seemingly obvious benefits for neurosurgeons has waned. We review the benefits and utility of iMRI across the field of neurosurgery and present an overview of the evidence for iMRI for multiple neurosurgical disciplines: tumor, skull base, vascular, pediatric, functional, and spine. Publications on iMRI have steadily increased since 1996, plateauing with approximately 52 publications per year since 2011. Tumor surgery, especially glioma surgery, has the most evidence for the use of iMRI contributing more than 50% of all iMRI publications, with increased rates of gross total resection in both adults and children, providing a potential survival benefit. Across multiple neurosurgical disciplines, the ability to use a multitude of unique sequences (diffusion tract imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, blood oxygenation level-dependent) allows for specialization of imaging for various types of surgery. Generally, iMRI allows for consideration of anatomic changes and real-time feedback on surgical outcomes such as extent of resection and instrument (screw, lead, electrode) placement. However, implementation of iMRI is limited by cost and feasibility, including the need for installation, shielding, and compatible tools. Evidence for iMRI use varies greatly by specialty, with the most evidence for tumor, vascular, and pediatric neurosurgery. The benefits of real-time anatomic imaging, a lack of radiation, and evaluation of surgical outcomes are limited by the cost and difficulty of iMRI integration. Nonetheless, the ability to ensure patients are provided by a maximal yet safe treatment that specifically accounts for their own anatomy and highlights why iMRI is a valuable and underutilized tool across multiple neurosurgical subspecialties.

N2  -  Small vessel disease is associated with age, mean blood pressure (MAP) and blood pressure pulsatility (PP). We used data from the UK Biobank cohort study to determine the relative importance of MAP versus PP driving white matter injury within individual white matter tracts, particularly in the anterior and posterior vascular territory. The associations between blood pressure and diffusion indices in 27 major tracts were analysed using unadjusted and fully-adjusted general linear models and mixed-effect linear models. Blood pressure and neuroimaging data were available for 37,041 participants (mean age 64+/-7.5 years, 53% female). In unadjusted analyses, MAP and PP were similarly associated with diffusion indices in the anterior circulation. In the posterior circulation, the associations were weaker, particularly for MAP. In fully-adjusted analyses, MAP remained associated with all diffusion indices in the anterior circulation, independently of age. In the posterior circulation, the effect of MAP became protective. PP remained associated with greater mean diffusivity and extracellular free water diffusion in the anterior circulation and all diffusion indices in the posterior circulation. There was a significant interaction between PP and age. This implies discordant mechanisms for chronic white matter injury in different brain regions and potentially in the associated stroke risks.

N2  -  A prospective quantitative MR study of brain tumours was performed to show the potential of combining different MR techniques to distinguish various disease processes in routine clinical practice.
Twenty-three patients with various intracranial tumours before treatment (diagnosis confirmed by a biopsy) and 59 healthy subjects were examined on a 3-T system by conventional MR imaging, 1H spectroscopic imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and T2 relaxometry. Metabolic concentrations and their ratios, T2 relaxation times and mean diffusivities were calculated and correlated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and compared to control data.; Different tumour types and different localisations revealed specific patterns of correlations between metabolic concentrations and mean diffusivity or T2 relaxation times. The patterns distinguish given tissue states in the examined area: healthy tissue, tissue infiltrated by tumour, active tumour, oedema infiltrated by tumour, oedema, etc. This method is able to describe the complexity of a highly heterogeneous tissue in the tumour and its vicinity, and determines crucial parameters for tissue differentiation.; A combination of different MR parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis in individual patients enables better identification of the tumour type, direction of proliferation and assessment of the tumour extension.; aEuro cent Magnetic resonance offers many different methods of examining the brain.; aEuro cent A combination of quantitative MR parameters helps distinguish different brain lesions; aEuro cent Different tumour types revealed specific correlation patterns amongst different MR parameters; aEuro cent The correlation patterns reflect highly heterogeneous complex tissue within tumours.

N2  -  Aims In this retrospective study we performed a quantitative textural analysis of apparant diffusion coefficient (ADC) images derived from diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) of single brain metastases (BM) patients from different primary tumors and tested whether these imaging parameters may improve established clinical risk models. Methods We identified 87 patients with single BM who had a DW-MRI at initial diagnosis. Applying image segmentation, volumes of contrast-enhanced lesions in T1 sequences, hyperintense T2 lesions (peritumoral border zone (T2PZ)) and tumor-free gray and white matter compartment (GMWMC) were generated and registered to corresponding ADC maps. ADC textural parameters were generated and a linear backward regression model was applied selecting imaging features in association with survival. A cox proportional hazard model with backward regression was fitted for the clinical prognostic models (diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment score (DS-GPA) and the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA)) including these imaging features. Results Thirty ADC textural parameters were generated and linear backward regression identified eight independent imaging parameters which in combination predicted survival. Five ADC texture features derived from T2PZ, the volume of the T2PZ, the normalized mean ADC of the GMWMC as well as the mean ADC slope of T2PZ. A cox backward regression including the DS-GPA, RPA and these eight parameters identified two MRI features which improved the two risk scores (HR = 1.14 [1.05;1.24] for normalized mean ADC GMWMC and HR = 0.87 [0.77;0.97]) for ADC 3D kurtosis of the T2PZ.) Conclusions Textural analysis of ADC maps in patients with single brain metastases improved established clinical risk models. These findings may aid to better understand the pathogenesis of BM and may allow selection of patients for new treatment options.

N2  -  Objective: To examine the association between enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and the prevalence and extent of small acute diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions (SA-DWIL) in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of 201 patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH who had brain MRI with DWI within 1 month of ICH onset. We compared the clinical and imaging characteristics, including EPVS, of patients with and without SA-DWIL. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the variables associated with SA-DWIL.; Results: Small acute DWI lesions were detected in 27.9% (n = 56) of patients. Intraventricular and subarachnoid extension of ICH (p <= 0.001), high centrum semiovale (CSO)-EPVS (p < 0.001), high basal ganglia-EPVS (p = 0.007), overall extent of white matter hyperintensity (p = 0.018), initial ICH volume (p = 0.001), and mean change in mean arterial blood pressure (delta MAP = MAP at admission - the lowest MAP before MRI scan) (p = 0.027) were associated with SA-DWIL on univariate analyses. On multivariate logistic regression analyses, larger ICH volume (odds ratio OR 1.03; 95% confidence interval CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.006) and high CSO-EPVS (OR 12.56; 95% CI 4.40-35.85; p < 0.001) were independently associated with the presence of SA-DWIL.; Conclusions: In our cohort, high EPVS, in particular CSO-EPVS, and larger hematoma volume emerged as independent predictors for SA-DWIL after ICH. Our findings might provide a new explanation for the pathophysiologic mechanisms predisposing to SA-DWIL after ICH.

N2  -  Purpose: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has been used for the early diagnosis of acute ischemic lesions in humans and in animal models of focal status epilepticus. We hypothesized that DWI may be a sensitive, noninvasive tool for the localization of the epileptogenic area during the periictal period.
Methods: A periictal DWI study was performed on a 35-year-old patient during focal status epilepticus with repetitive focal motor seizures originating from a lesion in the right frontal lobe. DWI results were analyzed visually and by calculating apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.; Results: Om DWI, a single area of signal increase (decrease in ADC) was found in the region of focal electrocorticographic seizures that was mapped intraoperatively.; Conclusions: Ictalpostictal DWI may be a useful technique for seizure localization in patients with lesional epilepsy.

N2  -  Since its identification in 1989, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a worldwide health problem with roughly 185 million chronic infections, representing individuals at high risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. In addition to being a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality due to liver disease, HCV has emerged as an important trigger of lymphoproliferative disorders, owing to its lymphotropism, and of a wide spectrum of extrahepatic manifestations (HCV-EHMs) affecting different organ systems. The most frequently observed HCV-EHMs include mixed cryoglobulinemia and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nephropathies, thyreopathies, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and several neurological conditions. In addition, neuropsychiatric disorders and neurocognitive dysfunction are reported in nearly 50% of patients with chronic HCV infection, which are independent of the severity of liver disease or HCV replication rates. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression and reduced quality of life are commonly associated with neurocognitive alterations in patients with non-cirrhotic chronic HCV infection, regardless of the stage of liver fibrosis and the infecting genotype. These manifestations, which are the topic of this review, typically occur in the absence of structural brain damage or signal abnormalities on conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although metabolic and microstructural changes can be detected by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI, and neurophysiological tests of cognitive processing. Several lines of evidence, including comparative and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments in patients achieving spontaneous or treatment-induced viral clearance, support a major pathogenic role for HCV in neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders.

N2  -  The goal of this study was to identify and describe the different types and patterns of tissue injury which are encountered by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in diffuse axonal injury (DAI) of the brain. The DWI data sets of 98 patients who suffered from a closed-head injury were retrospectively evaluated. Medical records were reviewed to rule out pre-existing neurological diseases. Lesions were studied for their DWI signal characteristics and lesion size or extension. Traumatic lesions were classified into three categories depending on their signal characteristica on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps: type 1, DWI- and ADC-hyperintense most likely representing lesions with vasogenic edema; type 2, DWI-hyperintense, ADC-hypointense indicating cytotoxic edema; type 3, central hemorrhagic lesion surrounded by an area of increased diffusion. According to the size and extent of lesions, injury was classified into three groups: group A, focal injury; group B, regional/confluent injury; and group C, extensive/diffuse injury. Our study showed that diffusion-weighted imaging differentiates between lesions with decreased and increased diffusion in patients with DAI. Different degrees of tissue injury extent were noticed. Future prospective studies should study if this additional information can be used as a predictor of injury reversibility, final outcome and prognosis.

N2  -  The anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, is standard treatment for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In this setting, traditional anatomic MRI methods such as post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging are proving unreliable for monitoring response. Here we evaluate the prognostic significance of pre- and posttreatment relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) derived from dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI to predict response to bevacizumab.
Thirty-six participants with recurrent high-grade gliomas who underwent rCBV imaging 60 days before and 20-60 days after starting bevacizumab treatment were enrolled. Tumor regions of interest (ROIs) were determined from deltaT1 maps computed from the difference between standardized post and precontrast T1-weighted images. Both pre- and posttreatment rCBV maps were corrected for leakage and standardized (stdRCBV) to a consistent intensity scale. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine if either the pre- or post-bevacizumab stdRCBV within the tumor ROI was predictive of overall survival (OS) or progression free survival (PFS).; The OS was significantly longer if either the pre- (380d vs 175d; P=.0024) or posttreatment stdRCBV (340d vs 186d; P = .0065) was < 4400. The posttreatment stdRCBV was also predictive of PFS (167d vs 78d; P = .0006). When the stdRCBV values were both above versus both below threshold, the OS was significantly worse (100.5d vs 395d; P < .0001). With a 32.5% decrease in stdRCBV, the risk of death was reduced by about 68% but increased by 140% with a 29% increase in stdRCBV.; Standardized rCBV is predictive of OS and PFS in patients with recurrent high-grade brain tumor treated with bevacizumab.

N2  -  The association of white matter (WM) lesions and grey matter (GM) atrophy is a feature in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The spatiotemporal distribution pattern of WM lesions, their relations to regional GM changes and the underlying dynamics are unclear. Here we combined parametric and non-parametric voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to clarify these issues. MRI data from RRMS patients with progressive (PLV, n = 45) and non-progressive WM lesion volumes (NPLV, n - 44) followed up for 12 months were analysed. Cross-sectionally, the spatial WM lesion distribution was compared using lesion probability maps (LPMs). Longitudinally, WM lesions and GM volumes were studied using FSL-VBM and SPM5-VBM, respectively. WM lesions clustered around the lateral ventricles and in the centrum semiovale with a more widespread pattern in the PLV than in the NPLV group. The maximum local probabilities were similar in both groups and higher for T2 lesions (PLV: 27%, NPLV: 25%) than for T1 lesions (PLV: 15%, NPLV 14%). Significant WM lesion changes accompanied by cortical GM volume reductions occured in the corpus callosum and optic radiations (P - 0.01 corrected), and more liberally tested (uncorrected P < 0.01) in the inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi, and corona radiata in the PLV group. Not any WM or GM changes were found in the NPLV group. In the PLV group, WM lesion distribution and development in fibres, was associated with regional GM volume loss. The different spatiotemporal distribution patterns of patients with progressive compared to patients with non-progressive WM lesions suggest differences in the dynamics of pathogenesis.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Surgical resection of cerebral cavernous malformations close to eloquent regions frequently uses fMRI and DTI for surgical planning to best preserve neurologic function. This study investigates the reliability of fMRI and DTI near cerebral cavernous malformations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cerebral cavernous malformations undergoing presurgical fMRI and DTI mapping were identified. Each cerebral cavernous malformation was hand-contoured; 2 sequential 4-mm expansion shells (S1 and S2) were cre-ated, generating 2 ROIs and 2 contralateral controls. Fractional anisotropy and regional homogeneity measurements were then extracted from each ROI and compared with the contralateral controls. Reliability, accuracy, and precision were compared as appropriate.RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were identified and included. Errors of fractional anisotropy were significantly lower than those of re-gional homogeneity in S1 and S2 (P <.001), suggesting that fractional anisotropy is more reliable than regional homogeneity near cerebral cavernous malformations. Proximity to cerebral cavernous malformations worsened the reliability of regional homogeneity (S1 versus S2, P <.001), but not fractional anisotropy (P = .24). While fractional anisotropy was not significantly biased in any ROI (P >.05), regional homogeneity was biased toward lower signals in S1 and S2 (P <.05), an effect that was attenuated with distance from cerebral cavernous malformations (P <.05). Fractional anisotropy measurements were also more precise than regional homo-geneity in S1 and S2 (P <.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hemosiderin-rich lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations may lead to artifac-tual depression of fMRI signals and that clinicians and surgeons should interpret fMRI studies near cerebral cavernous malforma-tions with caution. While fMRI is considerably affected by cerebral cavernous malformation-related artifacts, DTI appears to be relatively unaffected and remains a reliable imaging technique near cerebral cavernous malformations.

N2  -  Recent advances in neuroscience requires high-resolution MRI to decipher the structural and functional details of the brain. Developing a high-performance gradient system is an ongoing effort in the field to facilitate high spatial and temporal encoding. Here, we proposed a head-only gradient system NeuroFrontier, dedicated for neuroimaging with an ultra-high gradient strength of 650 mT/m and 600 T/m/s. The proposed system features in 1) ultra-high power of 7MW achieved by running two gradient power amplifiers using a novel paralleling method; 2) a force/torque balanced gradient coil design with a two-step mechanical structure that allows highefficiency and flexible optimization of the peripheral nerve stimulation; 3) a high-density integrated RF system that is miniaturized and customized for the head-only system; 4) an AI-empowered compressed sensing technique that enables ultra-fast acquisition of high-resolution images and AI-based acceleration in q-t space for diffusion MRI (dMRI); and 5) a prospective head motion correction technique that effectively corrects motion artifacts in real-time with 3D optical tracking. We demonstrated the potential advantages of the proposed system in imaging resolution, speed, and signal-to-noise ratio for 3D structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and dMRI in neuroscience applications of submillimeter layer-specific fMRI and dMRI. We also illustrated the unique strength of this system for dMRI-based microstructural mapping, e.g., enhanced lesion contrast at short diffusiontimes or high b-values, and improved estimation accuracy for cellular microstructures using diffusion-timedependent dMRI or for neurite microstructures using q-space approaches.

N2  -  Background: Measuring non-parametric intravoxel mean diffusivity distributions (MDDs) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive method for detecting intracellular diffusivity changes during physiological alterations. Histological and molecular glioma classifications are essential for prognosis and treatment, with distinct water diffusion dynamics among subtypes. Purpose: We developed a data-driven approach using a fully connected network (FCN) to enhance the speed and stability of calculating MDDs across varying SNRs, enable tumor microstructural mapping, and test its reliability in identifying MIB-1 labeling index (LI) levels and molecular status of gliomas.
Methods: An FCN was trained to learn the mapping between the simulated diffusion decay curves and the ground truth MDDs. We performed 5 000 000 simulation curves with various diffusivity components and random SNR is an element of 30, 300. Eighty percent of simulation curves were used for the FCN training, 10% for validation, and the others were external tests for the FCN performance evaluation. In vivo data were collected to evaluate its clinical reliability. One hundred one patients (44 years +- 14, 67 men) with gliomas and six healthy controls underwent a 3.0 T MRI examination with a spin echo-echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence. The trained FCN was employed to calculate MDDs of each brain voxel by voxel. We used the Fuzzy C-means algorithm to cluster the MDDs of tumor voxels, facilitating the characterization of distinct glioma tissues. Quantitative assessments were conducted through sectional integrals of the MDDs, demarcated by six bands to derive signal fractions (f(n), n = 1 - 6) and diffusivities of the maximum peaks (D-peak). Cosine similarity scores (CSS) were used for MDD similarity. ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test were used for difference analysis. Logistic regression and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) were used for classification evaluation.; Results: The simulation results showed that the FCN-based MDD approach (FCN-MDD) achieved higher CSS than non-negative least squares-based MDD (NNLS-MDD). For in vivo data, the spectra of ET and NET obtained by FCN-MDD are more distinguishable than NNLS-MDD. Fraction maps delineate the characteristics of different tumor tissues (enhancing and non-enhancing tumor, edema, and necrosis). f(3), f(4), D-peak showed a positive and negative correlation with MIB-1 respectively (r = 0.568, r = -0.521, r = -0.654, all p < 0.001). The AUC of D-peak for predicting MIB-1 LI levels was 0.900 (95% CI, 0.826-0.974), versus 0.781 (0.677-0.886) of ADC. The highest AUC of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, assessed by a logistic regression model (f(1) + f(3)) was 0.873 (95% CI, 0.802-0.944).; Conclusion: The proposed FCN-MDD method was more robust to variations in SNR and less reliant on empirically set regularization values than the NNLSMDD method. FCN-MDD also enabled qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the composition of gliomas.

N2  -  Cerebral manifestations in Japanese B encephalitis are well known. However, there are very few studies focusing on extra-cerebral manifestations, among which focal anterior horn cell involvement is exceedingly rare. We herein report a case of Japanese B encephalitis with focal anterior horn cell involvement and unfurl how stepwise clinical approach and targeted investigations helped to solve the diagnostic conundrum. A 27-year-old female was admitted with fever, headache, altered sensorium, and convulsions. She tested positive for Japanese B encephalitis-IgM. Following conservative management, she regained consciousness after 5 days when neurological examination revealed marked cognitive impairment, medial convergence of eyeballs, upward gaze restriction, upper limbs dystonia with brisk tendon jerks, and flaccid paraparesis. A repeat neurological examination, on day 15 of admission, showed marked wasting and intermittent fasciculation in both lower limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical (right > left) bilateral thalamic and midbrain lesions, hyperintense on T2 and T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted imaging with mild diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map, suggestive of encephalitis . Nerve conduction study revealed decreased compound muscle action potentials exclusively in lower limbs with intact sensory nerve action potentials. Electromyogram showed chronic denervation potentials and presence of spontaneous activity in lower limbs, but not in upper limbs, indicative of focal anterior horn cell involvement. Prognosis of Japanese B encephalitis does not only depend on cerebral sequelae. Anterior horn cell involvement can dictate poor outcome and can easily be missed if not carefully dealt with.

N2  -  Bevacizumab is thought to normalize tumor vasculature and restore the blood-brain barrier, decreasing enhancement and peritumoral edema. Conventional measurements of tumor response rely upon dimensions of enhancing tumor. After bevacizumab treatment, glioblastomas are more prone to progress as nonenhancing tumor. The RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) criteria for glioma response use fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)/T2 hyperintensity as a surrogate for nonenhancing tumor; however, nonenhancing tumor can be difficult to differentiate from other causes of FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity (eg, radiation-induced gliosis). Due to these difficulties, recent efforts have been directed toward identifying new biomarkers that either predict treatment response or accurately measure response of both enhancing and nonenhancing tumor shortly after treatment initiation. This will allow for earlier treatment decisions, saving patients from the adverse effects of ineffective therapies while allowing them to try alternative therapies sooner. An active area of research is the use of physiologic imaging, which can potentially detect treatment effects before changes in tumor size are evident.

N2  -  In brain tumor surgeries, maximum removal of cancerous tissue without compromising normal brain functions can improve the patient's survival rate and therapeutic benefits. To achieve this, diffusion MRI and intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) can be highly instrumental. While diffusion MRI allows the visualization of white matter tracts and helps define the resection plan to best preserve the eloquent areas, iUS can effectively track the brain shift after craniotomy that often renders the pre-surgical plan invalid, ensuring the accuracy and safety of the intervention. Unfortunately, brain shift correction using iUS and automatic registration has never been shown for brain tractography so far despite its rising significance in brain tumor resection.
We employed a correlation-ratio-based nonlinear registration algorithm to account for brain shift through MRI-iUS registration and used the recovered deformations to warp both the brain anatomy and tractography seen in pre-surgical plans. The overall technique was demonstrated retrospectively on four patients who underwent iUS-guided low-grade brain gliomas resection.; Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, the preoperative MRI and iUS scans were well realigned after nonlinear registration, and the deformed brain tumor volumes and white matter tracts showed large displacements away from the pre-surgical plans.; We are the first to demonstrate the technique to track nonlinear deformation of brain tractography using real clinical MRI and iUS data, and the results confirm the need for updating white matter tracts due to tissue shift during surgery.

N2  -  Background and Objective. Targeted speech therapy can lead to substantial naming improvement in some subjects with anomia following dominant-hemisphere stroke. We investigated whether treatment-induced improvement in naming is associated with poststroke preservation of structural neural network architecture. Methods. Twenty-four patients with poststroke chronic aphasia underwent 30 hours of speech therapy over a 2-week period and were assessed at baseline and after therapy. Whole brain maps of neural architecture were constructed from pretreatment diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging to derive measures of global brain network architecture (network small-worldness) and regional network influence (nodal betweenness centrality). Their relationship with naming recovery was evaluated with multiple linear regressions. Results. Treatment-induced improvement in correct naming was associated with poststroke preservation of global network small worldness and of betweenness centrality in temporal lobe cortical regions. Together with baseline aphasia severity, these measures explained 78% of the variability in treatment response. Conclusions. Preservation of global and left temporal structural connectivity broadly explains the variability in treatment-related naming improvement in aphasia. These findings corroborate and expand on previous classical lesion-symptom mapping studies by elucidating some of the mechanisms by which brain damage may relate to treated aphasia recovery. Favorable naming outcomes may result from the intact connections between spared cortical areas that are functionally responsive to treatment.

N2  -  Patients may present to the hospital at various times after an ischemic stroke. Many present weeks after a neurologic deficit has occurred, as is often the case with elderly patients and those in a nursing home. The ability to determine the age of an ischemic stroke provides useful clinical information for the patient, his or her family, and the medical team. Many times, perfusion imaging is not performed, and pulse sequence-specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings may help determine the age of the infarct. The findings seen at apparent diffusion coefficient mapping and diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and unenhanced and contrast material-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted gradient-echo and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging may help determine the relative age of a cerebral infarct. Strokes may be classified and dated as early hyperacute, late hyperacute, acute, subacute, or chronic. Recent data indicate that in many patients with restricted diffusion and no change on FLAIR images, it is more likely than was initially thought that the stroke is less than 6 hours old. The time window to administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is currently 4.5 hours from the time when the patient was last seen to be normal, and for anterior circulation strokes, the time window for administering intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator is 6 hours from when the patient was last seen to be normal. For this reason, accurate dating is important in patients with ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (NMO-IgG) is used as a diagnostic marker for neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Although the mechanism of spinal cord lesions in NMO has been investigated, that of extensive hemispheric lesions with brain edema remains unclear. Here we report a 36-year-old woman with NMO positive for NMO-IgG, who developed an acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like episode after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Brain MRI T2-weighted images demonstrated asymmetric tumefactive hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter. Importantly, no lesions on T1-weighted images were enhanced after intravenous gadolinium administration on serial brain MRIs, suggesting preserved integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Likewise, the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps demonstrated persistent hyperintensity changes, which represented vasogenic edema associated with glial damage and consequent neuronal loss. The findings suggest possible involvement of deficient water elimination associated with seropositivity to NMO-IgG in the induction of vasogenic edema even in the presence of intact and functional BBB.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic brain ischemic injury detected with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is reported in more than one-half of patients after cardiac surgery. There are conflicting findings on whether DWI-detected covert stroke is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction after surgery, and it is unclear whether such ischemic injury affects quality of life or behavioral outcomes. The purpose of this study was to perform exploratory analysis on whether covert stroke after cardiac surgery is associated with delayed neurocognitive recovery 1 month after surgery, impaired quality of life, anxiety, or depression. METHODS: Analysis of data collected in a prospectively randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery testing whether basing mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets during cardiopulmonary bypass to be above the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation versus usual practices reduces the frequency of adverse neurological outcomes. A neuropsychological testing battery was administered before surgery and then 1 month later. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between postoperative days 3 and 5. The primary outcome was DWI-detected ischemic lesion; the primary end point was change from baseline in domain-specific neurocognitive Z scores 1 month after surgery. Secondary outcomes included a composite indicator of delayed neurocognitive recovery, quality of life measures, state and trait anxiety, and Beck Depression Inventory scores. RESULTS: Of the 164 patients with postoperative MRI data, clinical stroke occurred in 10 patients. Of the remaining 154 patients, 85 (55.2%) had a covert stroke. There were no statistically significant differences for patients with or without covert stroke in the change from baseline in Z scores in any of the cognitive domains tested adjusted for sex, baseline cognitive score, and randomization treatment arm. The frequency of delayed neurocognitive recovery (no covert stroke, 15.1%; covert stroke, 17.6%; P = .392), self-reported quality of life measurements, anxiety rating, or depression scores were not different between those with or without DWI ischemic injury. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-half of patients undergoing cardiac surgery demonstrated covert stroke. In this exploratory analysis, covert stroke was not found to be significantly associated with neurocognitive dysfunction 1 month after surgery; evidence of impaired quality of life, anxiety, or depression, albeit a type II error, cannot be excluded.

N2  -  Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is a common finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the burden of TAI is associated with outcome in this patient group. Lesion mapping offers a way to combine imaging findings from numerous individual patients into common lesion maps where the findings from a whole patient cohort can be assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of TAI lesions on different MRI sequences and its associations to outcome with use of lesion mapping. Included prospectively were 269 patients (8-70 years) with moderate or severe TBI and MRI within six weeks after injury. The TAI lesions were evaluated and manually segmented on fluid-attenuated inversed recovery (FLAIR), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and either T2* gradient echo (T2*GRE) or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). The segmentations were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute space and combined to lesion frequency distribution maps. Outcome was assessed with Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score at 12 months. The frequency and distribution of TAI was assessed qualitatively by visual reading. Univariable associations to outcome were assessed qualitatively by visual reading and also quantitatively with use of voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). The highest frequency of TAI was found in the posterior half of corpus callosum. The frequency of TAI was higher in the frontal and temporal lobes than in the parietal and occipital lobes, and in the upper parts of the brainstem than in the lower. At the group level, all voxels in mesencephalon had TAI on FLAIR. The patients with poorest outcome (GOSE scores <= 4) had higher frequencies of TAI. On VLSM, poor outcome was associated with TAI lesions bilaterally in the splenium, the right side of tectum, tegmental mesencephalon, and pons. In conclusion, we found higher frequency of TAI in posterior corpus callosum, and TAI in splenium, mesencephalon, and pons were associated with poor outcome. If lesion frequency distribution maps containing outcome information based on imaging findings from numerous patients in the future can be compared with the imaging findings from individual patients, it would offer a new tool in the clinical workup and outcome prediction of the patient with TBI.

N2  -  BackgroundFollowing brain cancer treatment, the capacity of anatomical MRI to differentiate neoplastic tissue from treatment-related changes (e.g., pseudoprogression) is limited. This study compared apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) obtained by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) with static and dynamic parameters of O-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumour progression.Patients and methodsForty-eight pretreated high-grade glioma patients with anatomical MRI findings suspicious for progression (median time elapsed since last treatment was 16weeks) were investigated using DWI and dynamic FET PET. Maximum and mean tumour-to-brain ratios (TBRmax, TBRmean) as well as dynamic parameters (time-to-peak and slope values) of FET uptake were calculated. For mean ADC calculation, regions-of-interest analyses were performed on ADC maps calculated from DWI coregistered with the contrast-enhanced MR image. Diagnoses were confirmed neuropathologically (21%) or clinicoradiologically. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver-operating-characteristic analyses or Fisher's exact test for a combinational approach.ResultsTen of 48 patients had treatment-related changes (21%). The diagnostic performance of FET PET was significantly higher (threshold for both TBRmax and TBRmean, 1.95; accuracy, 83%; AUC, 0.890.05; P<0.001) than that of ADC values (threshold ADC, 1.09x10(-3)mm(2)/s; accuracy, 69%; AUC, 0.73 +/- 0.09; P=0.13). The addition of static FET PET parameters to ADC values increased the latter's accuracy to 89%. The highest accuracy was achieved by combining static and dynamic FET PET parameters (93%). Moreover, in contrast to ADC values, TBRs <1.95 at suspected progression predicted a significantly longer survival (P=0.01).Conclusions Data suggest that static and dynamic FET PET provide valuable information concerning the differentiation of early treatment-related changes from tumour progression and outperform ADC measurement for this highly relevant clinical question.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to assess the evolution of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) over the first month of life in asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia and to compare it with that of healthy newborns. Asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia were enrolled prospectively; and the presence and extent of brain injury were scored on each MRI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in the basal ganglia, in the white matter and in the cortical grey matter. Sixty-one asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia had a total of 126 ADC and FA maps. Asphyxiated newborns developing brain injury eventually had significantly decreased ADC values on days 2-3 of life and decreased FA values around day 10 and 1 month of life compared with those not developing brain injury. Despite hypothermia treatment, asphyxiated newborns may develop brain injury that still can be detected with advanced neuroimaging techniques such as DWI and DTI as early as days 2-3 of life. A study of ADC and FA values over time may aid in the understanding of how brain injury develops in these newborns despite hypothermia treatment.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: To investigate whether baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be employed to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes in acute ischemic stroke.
Materials and Methods: An automated image analysis system based on baseline ADC maps was tested against 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke of anterior circulation to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes. The predicted infarct core and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with follow-up imaging data in recanalization and no recanalization groups, respectively. Direct comparisons with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging measures were also made. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman rank correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were performed.; Results: In the recanalization group, the predicted infarct core volume was significantly correlated with the final infarct volume (r = 0.868, P < .001). In the no recanalization group, the predicted final infarct volume (sum of the predicted infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes), as well as the predicted salvageable ischemic tissue volume, was also significantly correlated with the true final infarct volume (r = 0.955, P < .001) and infarct growth (r = 0.918, P < .001), respectively. The volumes of perfusion-diffusion mismatch were significantly larger than those of infarct growth and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue. Good agreement between predicted and true final infarct lesions was visualized by Bland-Altman plots in two groups. Direct visual comparative analysis revealed good qualitative agreement between the true final infarct and predicted lesions in 21 patients.; Conclusion: The proposed ADC based approach may be a feasible and practical tool to predict the volumes of infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue without intravenous contrast media-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging at baseline.

N2  -  Purpose: To detect possible subclinical pathological brain changes a study on adult phenylketonuria (PKU) patients by using quantitative MRI methods was performed, since neuropsychological and cognitive deficits in treated patients with PKU have not yet been shown to correlate clearly with the brain lesions identified by conventional MRI.
Materials and Methods: Eight subjects, four PKU patients with well-documented dietary treatment and four age- and sex-matched adult controls, under-went MRI, including a triple echo sequence and a diffusion tensor imaging sequence. Brain maps of T2 relaxation time (T2), relative proton density (PD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were derived for each subject. T2. PD, FA, and ADC were measured in 22 predefined regions of gray matter (GM) and white matter on the corresponding maps, and compared with those of four age-matched healthy adult controls.; Results: In addition to a prolonged T2 value measured in affected WM, as expected, we observed a significant shortening of the T2 relaxation time and reduction of ADC in normal-appearing brain tissue and an increased proton density in both GM and WM of the patients. No differences were observed in FA values between controls and patients.; Conclusion: Repeatedly reduced T2 relaxation time, ADC, and increased proton density without changes in FA indicate a higher cell-packing density in normal-appearing brain without changes in the directedness of fibers. These structural changes may be related to neuropsychological and cognitive deficits in treated PKU patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Prediction of poststroke outcome using the degree of subacute deficit or magnetic resonance imaging is well studied in humans. While mice are the most commonly used animals in preclinical stroke research, systematic analysis of outcome predictors is lacking.
METHODS: We intended to incorporate heterogeneity into our retrospective study to broaden the applicability of our findings and prediction tools. We therefore analyzed the effect of 30, 45, and 60 minutes of arterial occlusion on the variance of stroke volumes. Next, we built a heterogeneous cohort of 215 mice using data from 15 studies that included 45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and various genotypes. Motor function was measured using a modified protocol for the staircase test of skilled reaching. Phases of subacute and residual deficit were defined. Magnetic resonance images of stroke lesions were coregistered on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to characterize stroke topology. Different random forest prediction models that either used motor-functional deficit or imaging parameters were generated for the subacute and residual deficits.; RESULTS: Variance of stroke volumes was increased by 45 minutes of arterial occlusion compared with 60 minutes. The inclusion of various genotypes enhanced heterogeneity further. We detected both a subacute and residual motor-functional deficit after stroke in mice and different recovery trajectories could be observed. In mice with small cortical lesions, lesion volume was the best predictor of the subacute deficit. The residual deficit could be predicted most accurately by the degree of the subacute deficit. When using imaging parameters for the prediction of the residual deficit, including information about the lesion topology increased prediction accuracy. A subset of anatomic regions within the ischemic lesion had particular impact on the prediction of long-term outcomes. Prediction accuracy depended on the degree of functional impairment.; CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we developed and validated a robust tool for the prediction of functional outcomes after experimental stroke in mice using a large and genetically heterogeneous cohort. These results are discussed in light of study design and imaging limitations. In the future, using outcome prediction can improve the design of preclinical studies and guide intervention decisions.

N2  -  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamic change in the hyperacute stage of cerebral fat embolism induced by triolein emulsion, by using MR perfusion imaging in cat brains.
METHODS: By using the femoral arterial approach, the internal carotid arteries of 14 cats were infused with an emulsion of triolein 0.05 mL. T2-weighted (T2WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, perfusion-weighted (PWI), and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (Gd-T1WI) images were obtained serially at 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 6 hours after infusion. The MR images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative evaluation was performed by assessing the signal intensity of the serial MR images. Quantitative assessment was performed by comparing the signal-intensity ratio (SIR) of the lesions to the contralateral normal side calculated on T2WIs, Gd-T1WIs, DWIs, and ADC maps at each acquisition time and by comparing the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit times (MTT) of the lesions to the contralateral normal side calculated on PWI.; RESULTS: In the qualitative evaluation of the MR images, the lesions showed hyperintensity on T2WIs, enhancement on the Gd-T1WIs, and isointensity on DWIs and the ADC maps. In the quantitative studies, SIRs on the Gd-T1WIs, DWIs, and ADC maps peaked at 2 hours after infusion. The SIRs on the T2WIs peaked at 4 hours after infusion and decreased thereafter. On PWIs, the rCBV, rCBF, and MTT of the lesion showed no significant difference from the contralateral normal side (P = .09, .30, and .13, respectively) and showed no significant change of time course (P = .17, .31, and .66, respectively).; CONCLUSION: The embolized lesions induced by triolein emulsion showed no significant difference in cerebral hemodynamic parameters from those on the contralateral normal side. The result may suggest that consideration of the hemodynamic factor of embolized lesions is not necessary in further studies of the blood-brain barrier with triolein emulsion.

N2  -  We have extended a mathematical model of gliomas based on proliferation and diffusion rates to incorporate the effects of augmented cell motility in white matter as compared to grey matter. Using a detailed mapping of the white and grey matter in the brain developed for a MRI simulator, we have been able to simulate model tumours on an anatomically accurate brain domain. Our simulations show good agreement with clinically observed tumour geometries and suggest paths of submicroscopic tumour invasion not detectable on CT or MRI images. We expect this model to give insight into microscopic and submicroscopic invasion of the human brain by glioma cells. This method gives insight in microscopic and submicroscopic invasion of the human brain by glioma cells. Additionally, the model can be useful in defining expected pathways of invasion by glioma cells and thereby identify regions of the brain on which to focus treatments.

N2  -  A focus of infarction is surrounded by hypoperfused areas. The present study was undertaken to examine the long-term changes in the size of infarcts, the relationship between the size of an infarct and the extent of the surrounding hypoperfused areas, and the background of such changes. The subjects of this study were 11 patients with ischemic lesions of the brain who had undergone brain SPECT (Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer) within 1 week after initial MRI, and who underwent MRI again more than half a year later. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was conducted to detect significantly hypoperfused areas on the SPECT images. Relative size of significantly hypoperfused areas on SPM and infarcts on T-2-weighted MR images were measured. The patients were divided into two groups based on the percentage of the infarct's size relative to the size of the surrounding hypoperfused areas (75-125 and 0-39%). Infarcts in the '75-125%' group showed little change in size, while in the '0-39%' group infarcts increased slowly until it reached the same rate as the former group. All patients with infarct in the '0-39%' group were noted to have severe stenosis of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. Patients having severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery often had a slowly enlarging infarct. SPM seems to be useful in predicting the ultimate size of the infarct. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

N2  -  Making robust inferences about the functional neuroanatomy of the brain is critically dependent on experimental techniques that examine the consequences of focal loss of brain function. Unfortunately, the use of the most comprehensive such technique-lesion-function-mapping is complicated by the need for time-consuming and subjective manual delineation of the lesions, greatly limiting the practicability of the approach. Here we exploit a recently-described general measure of statistical anomaly, zeta, to devise a fully-automated, high-dimensional algorithm for identifying the parameters of lesions within a brain image given a reference set of normal brain images. We proceed to evaluate such an algorithm in the context of diffusion-weighted imaging of the commonest type of lesion used in neuroanatomical research: ischaemic damage. Summary performance metrics exceed those previously published for diffusion-weighted imaging and approach the current gold standard-manual segmentation-sufficiently closely for fully-automated lesion-mapping studies to become a possibility. We apply the new method to 435 unselected images of patients with ischaemic stroke to derive a probabilistic map of the pattern of damage in lesions involving the occipital lobe, demonstrating the variation of anatomical resolvability of occipital areas so as to guide future lesion-function studies of the region.

N2  -  The distribution of serotonergic nerves in major basal and isolated small pial arteries (diameter greater-than-or-equal-to 50 mum) was investigated immunohistochemically using an antibody directed against tryptophan-5-hydroxylase (TPOH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin), and compared to that of the noradrenergic system labeled for the selective noradrenaline (NA) synthesizing enzyme, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). In addition, the possible peripheral and/or central origins of the cerebrovascular serotonergic (TPOH-positive) nerve fibers were examined. Strongly labeled TPOH-immunoreactive (TPOH-I) fiber bundles were observed in major basal arteries and gave rise to small varicose fibers organized in a meshwork pattern. The highest density of TPOH-I fibers was found in the middle cerebral artery followed by the anterior cerebral and the anterior communicating arteries, with a moderate to low density in the internal carotid and the vertebro-basilar trunk. Of the isolated pial arteries, only the larger ones (diameter > 75 mum) were significantly endowed with TPOH-I varicose fibers. However, free floating TPOH-I nerves were observed coursing through the pia-arachnoid membranes and reaching small pial vessels. In contrast, DBH-I nerve fibers were fine and were visualized primarily as numerous varicosities distributed in a circumferential manner around the vessel wall. A very high density of DBH-I varicosities was seen in the rostral part of the circle of Willis, with the internal carotid being the most richly supplied followed by the anterior cerebral and the anterior communicating arteries; comparatively, the middle cerebral artery was moderately innervated. Tle differences in distribution pattern and density between TPOH-I and DBH-I cerebrovascular fibers clearly suggest that these two innervation systems are not exactly superimposable. Superior cervical ganglionectomy caused an almost complete disappearance of TPOH-I nerves in all vascular segments, with some residual fibers in selected vessels. Lesion of the central serotonergic component with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine had virtually no effect on the TPOH-1 fibers in the major basal and isolated pial arteries. These results strongly suggest that the serotonergic innervation of major cerebral as well as pial arteries has a prominent peripheral origin closely related to the sympathetic system. Processing of superior cervical ganglion slices for TPOH immunocytochemistry, however, failed to unequivocally detect TPOH-I neurons.

N2  -  The treatment of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) in pediatric age is still controversial. However, most authors report longer life expectancy in case of completely removed cerebral gliomas. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is increasingly utilized in the surgical management of intra-axial tumor in adults following the demonstration of its effectiveness. In this article, we analyze the management of LGG using iMRI focusing on its impact on resection rate and its limits in the pediatric population.
We performed review of the literature regarding the treatment of LGG using iMRI focusing on its impact on resection rate and its limits in the pediatric population. Some exemplary cases are also described.; Intraoperative MRI allowed extension of tumor resection after the depiction of residual tumor at the intraoperative imaging control from 21 to 52 % of the cases in the published series. Moreover, the early reoperation rate was significantly lower when compared with the population treated without this tool (0 % vs 7-14 %). Some technical difficulties have been described in literature regarding the use of iMRI in the pediatric population especially for positioning due to the structure of the headrest coil designed for adult patients.; The analysis of the literature and our own experience with iMRI in children indicates significant advantages in the resection of LGG offered by the technique. All these advantages are obtained without elongation of the surgical times or increased risk for complications, namely infection. The main limit for a wider diffusion of iMRI for the pediatric neurosurgical center is the cost required, for acquisition of the system, especially for high-field magnet, and the environmental and organizational changes necessary for its use.

N2  -  IntroductionThis study explores the feasibility of implementing a tractography-based navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) language mapping protocol targeting cortical terminations of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). We compared the results and distribution of errors from the new protocol to an established perisylvian nTMS protocol that stimulated without any specific targeting over the entire perisylvian cortex. MethodsSixty right-handed patients with language-eloquent brain tumors were examined in this study with one half of the cohort receiving the tractographybased protocol and the other half receiving the perisylvian protocol. Probabilistic tractography using MRtrix3 was performed for patients in the tractography-based group to identify the AF's cortical endpoints. nTMS mappings were performed and resulting language errors were classified into five psycholinguistic groups. ResultsTractography and nTMS were successfully performed in all patients. The tractogram-based group showed a significantly higher median overall ER than the perisylvian group (3.8% vs. 2.9% p <.05). The median ER without hesitation errors in the tractogram-based group was also significantly higher than the perisylvian group (2.0% vs. 1.4%, p <.05). The ERs by error type showed no significant differences between protocols except in the no response ER, with a higher median ER in the tractogram-based group (0.4% vs. 0%, p <.05). Analysis of ERs based on the Corina cortical parcellation system showed especially high nTMS ERs over the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) in the perisylvian protocol and high ERs over the middle and ventral postcentral gyrus (vPoG), the opercular inferior frontal gyrus (opIFG) and the ventral precentral gyrus (vPrG) in the tractography-based protocol. DiscussionBy considering the white matter anatomy and performing nTMS on the cortical endpoints of the AF, the efficacy of nTMS in disrupting patients' object naming abilities was increased. The newly introduced method showed proof of concept and resulted in AF-specific ERs and noninvasive cortical language maps, which could be applied to additional fiber bundles related to the language network in future nTMS studies.

N2  -  Objective. To effectively combine functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor tractography (both guided by neuronavigation) along with cortical stimulation (CS) for surgery of eloquent cortex (EC) lesions. Materials and methods. Fifteen patients with lesions adjacent to the eloquent motor and sensory cortex were included. Preoperative fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging were performed and then integrated into the neuronavigation system. Intraoperative CS of sensory/motor cortex was performed to localize the EC under awake condition and this was correlated with areas active on fMRI utilizing neuronavigation. For excision of the deeper structures, CS, and tractography guided by neuronavigation were utilized. Results. A total of 127 cortical sites were evaluated with CS in 15 patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of fMRI were 79%, 85%, and 82%, respectively, keeping the areas positive on CS as a referential parameter. Tractography helped in resecting the deeper areas of the tumor, but was not very accurate due to brain shift. However, it was useful in roughly assessing the deeper areas close to the long tracts. The risk of developing persistent neurological deficits was 6%. Pathologies included gliomas in ten patients, cavernous malformation in two patients, meningioma in one patient, and focal cortical dysplasia and Dysembryonic neuroepithelial tumor in one patient each. Near total excision was achieved in 7/10 (>95% excision) gliomas and a total excision in all others lesions. Conclusions. Lesions directly over the EC present a special surgical challenge. The challenge lies in excising these lesions without producing any deficits. These goals may be achieved better by combined use of multimodal neuronavigation (fMRI and tractography) and intraoperative mapping with CS under awake conditions.

N2  -  Background: The MRI-based mismatch concept has been used to estimate the risk of infarction in ischemic stroke. Based on multiple studies on magnetic resonance perfusion imaging, it seems unlikely that any perfusion parameter threshold will provide a reliable prediction of radiological or clinical outcome for all patients. The goal of our study was to find a minimally biased yet maximally useful perfusion post-processing protocol which would offer the treating physician a useful estimate of tissue fate. Methods: One hundred and forty-five acute ischemic stroke patients, admitted within 24 h after stroke to the Charite - University Medicine Hospital in Berlin between March 2008 and November 2009, were included in this study. Using three different software packages (Perfscape/Neuroscape, PMA and Stroketool), maps of mean transit time, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and T(max) were created. Three different thresholds were applied on each parameter map and subsequent volumes of hypoperfused tissue were calculated. Results: Overall, the maps and thresholds giving the least amount of overestimation of the final infarct volume were T(max) 8 s in Perfscape/Neuroscape, CBF 20 ml/100 g/min in PMA and CBF 15% (of the highest value on the scale for a given patient) in Stroketool. In patients with persistent vessel occlusion, a CBF map with a restrictive threshold showed volumes of tissue at definite risk of infarction in up to 100% of patients. The additional use of a CBF map with a high threshold enabled identification of patients without penumbras. Conclusions: No combination of software, map and threshold was able to give a reliable estimate of tissue fate for either all patients or any subgroup of patients. However, in patients with vessel occlusion, combination of a CBF map with a low and a high threshold can enable calculation of the minimum volume of brain tissue that will inevitably be lost if the occlusion persists.

N2  -  Purpose While MRI has become the imaging modality of choice in the diagnosis of sellar tumors, no systematic attempt has yet been made to align radiological reporting of findings with the information needed by the various medical disciplines dealing with these patients. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevailing preferences in this regard through a nationwide expert survey.Methods First, an interdisciplinary literature-based catalog of potential reporting elements for sellar tumor MRI examinations was created. Subsequently, a web-based survey regarding the clinical relevance of these items was conducted among board certified members of the German Society of Neurosurgery, German Society of Radiation Oncology, and the Pituitary Working Group of the German Society of Endocrinology.Results A total of 95 experts (40 neurosurgeons, 28 radiation oncologists, and 27 endocrinologists) completed the survey. The description of the exact tumor location, size, and involvement of the anatomic structures adjacent to the sella turcica (optic chiasm, cavernous sinus, and skull base), occlusive hydrocephalus, relationship to the pituitary gland and infundibulum, and certain structural characteristics of the mass (cyst formation, hemorrhage, and necrosis) was rated most important (> 75% agreement). In contrast, the characterization of anatomic features of the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus as well as the findings of advanced MRI techniques (e.g., perfusion and diffusion imaging) was considered relevant by less than 50% of respondents.Conclusion To optimally address the information needs of the interdisciplinary treatment team, MRI reports of sellar masses should primarily focus on the accurate description of tumor location, size, internal structure, and involvement of adjacent anatomic compartments.

N2  -  ObjectiveTo investigate the histopathological correlates of quantitative relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to determine their efficacy in epileptogenic lesion detection for preoperative evaluation of focal epilepsy.
MethodsWe correlated quantitative relaxometry and DTI with histological features of neuronal density and morphology in 55 regions of the temporal lobe neocortex, selected from 13 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery. We made use of a validated nonrigid image registration protocol to obtain accurate correspondences between in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and histology images.; ResultsWe found T1 to be a predictor of neuronal density in the neocortical gray matter (GM) using linear mixed effects models with random effects for subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was a predictor of neuronal density of large-caliber neurons only (pyramidal cells, layers 3 and 5). Comparing multivariate to univariate mixed effects models with nested variables demonstrated that employing T1 and FA together provided a significantly better fit than T1 or FA alone in predicting density of large-caliber neurons. Correlations with clinical variables revealed significant positive correlations between neuronal density and age (r(s)=0.726, p(fwe)=0.021). This study is the first to relate in vivo T1 and FA values to the proportion of neurons in GM.; InterpretationOur results suggest that quantitative T1 mapping and DTI may have a role in preoperative evaluation of focal epilepsy and can be extended to identify GM pathology in a variety of neurological disorders.

N2  -  We investigated the in vivo effect of hyperthermia on the expression of heat shock proteins and MRI changes in three tumor cell lines. Three tumor cell lines (SCCVII, NIH3T3, M21) were transfected with a plasmid containing the heat shock protein 70 gene (hsp70) promoter fragment and the luciferase reporter gene, and injected into mice. Tumors of 1100 mm3 in size were exposed to five different temperatures (38, 40, 42, 44 and 46 degrees C) in a water bath. Bioluminescence and MRI were performed at set time intervals. The MRI scan protocol was as follows: T1-weighted spin echo?+/-?contrast medium, T2-weighted fast spin echo, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted stimulated echo acquisition mode sequence, T2 time obtained on a 1.5T General Electric MRI scanner. Immunoblotting was also performed. hsp70 transcription was strongly induced at 42 and 44 degrees C, reaching values as high as 8531.5?+/-?432.1-fold above baseline in NIH3T3 tumors. At these temperatures, significant increases in the uptake of contrast medium, slope of initial enhancement, Akep values and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were observed in the 8-h scan of the NIH3T3 cell line. In SCCVII tumors, ADC increased by about 23% (p?=?0.010) in the scans performed at 8, 24, 48 and 96 h. At 46 degrees C, luciferase activity was reduced significantly in the three cell lines. In all tumor types, a significant increase in ADC was observed, which was highest in SCCVII tumors (33.8%; p?<?0.01). In accordance with the bioluminescence results, significant Hsp70 protein production was shown by immunoblot analysis. The best correlation coefficient between luciferase activity and immunoblotting results was found for M21 tumors (r?=?0.93, p?<?0.0001). Different tissue types display distinct patterns of hsp70 transcription. MRI can be used, in combination with optical imaging, to provide information on hsp70 transcription and protein production. The major finding of the present study was that heat-related biochemical changes in tumor tissue can be determined by MRI. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can detect microstructural brain tissue changes and may be helpful in determining age-related cerebral damage. We investigated the association between the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in gray and white matter (WM) and cognitive functioning in 355 participants of the Austrian stroke prevention family study (ASPS-Fam) aged 38-86 years. MTR maps were generated for the neocortex, deep gray matter structures, WM hyperintensities, and normal appearing WM (NAWM). Adjusted mixed models determined whole brain and lobar cortical MTR to be directly and significantly related to performance on tests of memory, executive function, and motor skills. There existed an almost linear dose-effect relationship. MTR of deep gray matter structures and NAWM correlated to executive functioning. All associations were independent of demographics, vascular risk factors, focal brain lesions, and cortex volume. Further research is needed to understand the basis of this association at the tissue level, and to determine the role of MTR in predicting cognitive decline and dementia.

N2  -  Background: Studies of lesion location have been unsuccessful in identifying mappings between single brain regions and post-stroke depression (PSD). Based on studies implicating the reward system in major depressive disorder without stroke, we investigated structural correlates within this system and their associations with PSD.
Methods: The study enrolled 16 healthy controls, 12 stroke patients with PSD and 34 stroke patients free of PSD. Participants underwent 3T structural and diffusion MRI. Graph theoretical measures were used to examine global topology and whole-brain connectome analyses were employed to assess differences in the interregional connectivity matrix between groups. Structural correlates specific to the reward system were examined from grey matter volumes and by reconstructing its main white matter pathways, namely the medial forebrain bundle and cingulum connections, using deterministic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was derived as a measure of microstructural organization, and extracellular free-water (FW) as a possible proxy of neuroinflammation.; Results: Subnetworks of decreased FA-weighted and increased FW-weighted connectivity were observed in patients with PSD relative to healthy controls. These networks subsumed the majority of regions constituting the reward system. Within the reward system, FA and FW of major connection pathways and grey matter volume were collectively predictive of PSD, explaining 37.8% of the variance in depression severity.; Conclusions: PSD is associated with grey matter volume loss, reduced FA and increased extracellular FW in the reward system, similar to features observed in major depression without stroke. Structural characterization of the reward system is a promising biomarker of vulnerability to depression after stroke.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate pathway-specific connectivity disrupted in psychosis. Methods: We carried out a case study of a middle-aged patient who presented with new-onset psychosis associated with a space-occupying lesion localized in the right superior colliculus/periaqueductal gray. The study sought to investigate potential connectivity deficits related to the lesion by the use of diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. To this aim, we generated a functional connectivity map of the patient's brain, centered on the lesion area, and compared this map with the corresponding map of 10 sex- and age-matched control individuals identified from the Max Planck Institute-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body database. Results: Our analysis revealed a discrete area in the right rostral tectum, in the immediate vicinity of the lesion, whose activity is inversely correlated with the activity of left amygdala, whereas left amygdala is functionally associated with select areas of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Based on a comparative analysis of the patient with 10 control individuals, the lesion has impacted on the connectivity of rostral tectum (superior colliculus/periaqueductal gray) with left amygdala as well as on the connectivity of left amygdala with subcortical and cortical areas. Conclusions: The superior colliculus/periaqueductal gray might play important roles in the initiation and perpetuation of psychosis, at least partially through dysregulation of left amygdala activity.

N2  -  Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is highly prevalent but lacks both research tools with adequate sensitivity to detect cellular alterations that accompany mild injury and preclinical models that are able to robustly mimic hallmark features of human TBI. To address these related challenges, high-resolution diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) analysis was performed in a model of mild TBI in the ferret - a species that, unlike rodents, share with humans a gyrencephalic cortex and high white matter (WM) volume. A set of DTI image analysis tools were optimized and implemented to explore key features of DTI alterations in ex vivo adult male ferret brains (n = 26), evaluated 1 day to 16 weeks after mild controlled cortical impact (CCI). Using template-based ROI analysis, lesion overlay mapping and DTI-driven tensor-based morphometry (D-TBM) significant differences in DTI and morphometric values were found and their dependence on time after injury evaluated. These observations were also qualitatively compared with immunohistochemistry staining of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the same tissue. Focal DTI abnormalities including reduced cortical diffusivity were apparent in 12/13 injured brains with greatest lesion extent found acutely following CCI by ROI overlay maps and reduced WM FA in the chronic period was observed near to the CCI site (ANOVA for FA in focal WM: time after CCI p = 0.046, brain hemisphere p = 0.0012) often in regions without other prominent MRI abnormalities. Global abnormalities were also detected, especially for WM regions, which demonstrated reduced diffusivity (ANOVA for Trace: time after CCI p = 0.007) and atrophy that appeared to become more extensive and bilateral with longer time after injury (ANOVA for D-TBM Log of the Jacobian values: time after CCI p = 0.007). The findings of this study extend earlier work in rodent models especially by evaluation of focal WM abnormalities that are not influenced by partial volume effects in the ferret. There is also substantial overlap between DTI and morphometric findings in this model and those from human studies of mTBI implying that the combination of DTI tools with a human-similar model system can provide an advantageous and informative approach for mTBI research.

N2  -  Background: The surgical strategy for brain glioma has changed, shifting from tumor debulking to a more careful tumor dissection with the aim of a gross-total resection, extended beyond the contrast-enhancement MRI, including the hyperintensity on FLAIR MR images and defined as supratotal resection. It is possible to pursue this goal thanks to the refinement of several technological tools for pre and intraoperative planning including intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), cortico-subcortical mapping, functional MRI (fMRI), navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), intraoperative CT or MRI (iCT, iMR), and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound. This systematic review provides an overview of the state of the art techniques in the application of nTMS and nTMS-based DTI-FT during brain tumor surgery.
Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The authors searched the PubMed and Scopus databases until July 2020 for published articles with the following Mesh terms: (Brain surgery OR surgery OR craniotomy) AND (brain mapping OR functional planning) AND (TMS OR transcranial magnetic stimulation OR rTMS OR repetitive transcranial stimulation). We only included studies regarding motor mapping in craniotomy for brain tumors, which reported data about CTS sparing.; Results: A total of 335 published studies were identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. After a detailed examination of these studies, 325 were excluded from our review because of a lack of data object in this search. TMS reported an accuracy range of 0.4-14.8 mm between the APB hotspot (n14 8) in nTMS and DES from the DES spot; nTMS influenced the surgical indications in 34.3-68.5%.; Conclusion: We found that nTMS can be defined as a safe and non-invasive technique and in association with DES, fMRI, and IONM, improves brain mapping and the extent of resection favoring a better postoperative outcome.

N2  -  Current endeavors in neuro-oncology include morphological validation of imaging methods by histology, including molecular and immunohistochemical techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an up-to-date methodology of intracranial diagnostics that has gained importance in studies of neoplasia. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of discriminant analysis applied to histograms of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-derived images for the prediction of glioma grade validated by histomorphology.
Tumors of 40 consecutive patients included 13 grade II astrocytomas, seven oligoastrocytomas, six grade II oligodendrogliomas, three grade III oligoastrocytomas, and 11 glioblastoma multiformes. Preoperative DTI data comprised: unweighted (B (0)) images, fractional anisotropy, longitudinal and radial diffusivity maps, directionally averaged diffusion-weighted imaging, and trace images. Sampling consisted of generating histograms for gross tumor volumes; 25 histogram bins per scalar map were calculated. The histogram bins that allowed the most precise determination of low-grade (LG) or high-grade (HG) classification were selected by multivariate discriminant analysis. Accuracy of the model was defined by the success rate of the leave-one-out cross-validation.; Statistical descriptors of voxel value distribution did not differ between LG and HG tumors and did not allow classification. The histogram model had 88.5% specificity and 85.7% sensitivity in the separation of LG and HG gliomas; specificity was improved when cases with oligodendroglial components were omitted.; Constructing histograms of preoperative radiological images over the tumor volume allows representation of the grade and enables discrimination of LG and HG gliomas which has been confirmed by histopathology.

N2  -  Object. Ischemia-induced tissue depolarizations probably play an important role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia caused by parent vessel occlusion. Their role in ischemia caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains to be investigated. The authors determined whether ischemic depolarizations (IDs) or cortical spreading depressions (CSDs) occur after SAH. and how these relate to the extent of tissue injury measured on magnetic resonance (MR) images. In addition, they assessed whether administration of MgSO4 reduces depolarization time and lesion volume.
Methods. By means of the endovascular suture model, experimental SAH was induced in 52 rats, of which 37 were appropriate for analysis, including four animals that underwent sham operations. Before induction of SAH, serum Mg++ levels were measured and 90 mgkg intravascular MgSO4 or saline was given. Extracellular direct current potentials were continuously recorded from six AgAgCl electrodes, before and up to 90 minutes following SAH, after which serum Mg++ levels were again measured. Next, animals were transferred to the MR imaging magnet for diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging. Depolarization times per electrode were averaged to determine a mean depolarization time per animal.; No depolarizations occurred in sham-operated animals. Ischemic depolarizations occurred at all electrodes in all animals after SAH. Only two animals displayed a single spreading depression-like depolarization. The mean duration of the ID time was 41 +- 25 minutes in the saline-treated controls and 31 +- 30 minutes in the Mg++-treated animals (difference 10 minutes; p = 0.31). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of tissue H2O, obtained using DW images approximately 2.5 hours after SAH induction. demonstrated hypointensities in both hemispheres, but predominantly in the ipsilateral cortex. No ADC abnormalities were found in sham-operated animals. The mean lesion volume, as defined on the basis of a significant ADC reduction, was 0.32 +- 0.42 ml in saline-treated controls and 0.11 +- 0.06 ml in Mg++-treated animals (difference 0.21 ml; p = 0.045). Serum Mg++ levels were significantly elevated in the Mg++-treated group.; Conclusions. On the basis of their data. the authors suggest that CSDs play a minor role, if any, in the acute pathophysiology of SAH. Administration of Mg++ reduces the cerebral lesion volume that is present during the acute period after SAH. The neuroprotective value of Mg++ after SAH may, in part, be explained by a reduction in the duration of the ID of brain cells.

N2  -  We measured ischemic brain changes with diffusion and perfusion MRI in 42 ischemic stroke patients before and 2 hours (range approximately 1.5 to 4.5 hours) after standard intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy. The median time from stroke onset to tPA was 131 minutes. Clinical and MRI variables (change in perfusion and/or diffusion weighted lesion volume) were compared between those with excellent outcome defined as 3-month modified Rankin score (mRS) of 0 to 1 and those with incomplete recovery (mRS > 1). In multivariate logististic regression analysis, the most powerful independent predictor for excellent outcome was improved brain perfusion: hypoperfusion volume on mean transit time (MTT) map decrease >30% from baseline to 2-hour post tPA scan (p = 0.009; odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 20.7 [2.1-203.9]). Except for age <70 years, no other baseline clinical or imaging variable was an independent predictor of outcome. We propose MTT lesion volume decrease more than 30% 2 hours after tPA as an early marker of long-term clinical benefit of thrombolytic therapy.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a safe and noninvasive technique that provides insight into the microarchitecture of brain tissue. Relaxation-diffusion MRI (rdMRI) is an extension of traditional dMRI that captures diffusion imaging data at multiple TEs to detect tissue heterogeneity between relaxation and diffusivity. rdMRI has great potential in neurosurgical research including brain tumor grading and treatment response evaluation. However, the lack of available data has limited the exploration of rdMRI in clinical settings. To address this, we are sharing a high-quality rdMRI dataset from 18 neurosurgical patients with different types of lesions, as well as two healthy individuals as controls. The rdMRI data was acquired using 7 TEs, where at each TE multi-shell dMRI with high spatial and angular resolutions is obtained at each TE. Each rdMRI scan underwent thorough artifact and distortion corrections using a specially designed processing pipeline. The dataset's quality was assessed using standard practices, including quality control and assurance. This resource is a valuable addition to neurosurgical studies, and all data are openly accessible.

N2  -  Developmental neuroplasticity allows young brains to adapt via experiences early in life and also to compensate after injury. Why certain individuals are more adaptable remains underexplored. Perinatal stroke is an ideal human model of neuroplasticity with focal lesions acquired near birth in a healthy brain. Machine learning can identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional datasets. We used machine learning to identify structural and functional connectivity biomarkers most predictive of motor function. Forty-nine children with perinatal stroke and 27 controls were studied. Functional connectivity was quantified by fluctuations in blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal between regions. White matter tractography of corticospinal tracts quantified structural connectivity. Motor function was assessed using validated bimanual and unimanual tests. RELIEFF feature selection and random forest regression models identified predictors of each motor outcome using neuroimaging and demographic features. Unilateral motor outcomes were predicted with highest accuracy (8/54 features r = 0.58, 11/54 features, r = 0.34) but bimanual function required more features (51/54 features, r = 0.38). Connectivity of both hemispheres had important roles as did cortical and subcortical regions. Lesion size, age at scan, and type of stroke were predictive but not highly ranked. Machine learning regression models may represent a powerful tool in identifying neumimaging biomarkers associated with clinical motor function in perinatal stroke and may inform personalized targets for neuromodulation.

N2  -  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by benign hamartomas in multiple organs including the brain and its clinical phenotypes may be associated with abnormal neural connections. We aimed to provide the first detailed findings on disrupted structural brain networks in TSC patients. Structural whole-brain connectivity maps were constructed using structural and diffusion MRI in 20 TSC (age range: 3-24 years) and 20 typically developing (TD; 3-23 years) subjects. We assessed global (short and long-association and interhemispheric fibers) and regional white matter connectivity, and performed graph theoretical analysis using gyral pattern- and atlas-based node parcellations. Significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) was shown in TSC patients than in TD controls throughout the whole brain and positively correlated with tuber load severity. A significant increase in MD was mainly influenced by an increase in radial diffusivity. Furthermore, interhemispheric connectivity was particularly reduced in TSC, which leads to increased network segregation within hemispheres. TSC patients with developmental delay (DD) showed significantly higher MD than those without DD primarily in intrahemispheric connections. Our analysis allows non biased determination of differential white matter involvement, which may provide better measures of "lesion load" and lead to a better understanding of disease mechanisms.

N2  -  Routine shunting to minimize ischemia during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is controversial. The aim of this study was to stratify the ischemic parameters associated with CEA and evaluate the effect of routine shunting in attempting to mitigate those ischemia.
Data from 248 CEAs with routine shunting were retrospectively evaluated. Our assessment included somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) amplitude reduction more than 50 % and longer than 5 min (SSEP < 50%, > 5 min), new postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging lesions (new DWI lesions), and severe stenosis as indicated by reduced ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) signal on preoperative magnetic resonance angiography (MRA asymmetry), as surrogates of hypoperfusion, microembli, and hemodynamic impairment, respectively.; SSEP < 50%, > 5 min occurred in 15 % of CEAs during cross-clamping, and shunting reversed the SSEP changes. New DWI lesions were observed in 4.1 %. Pre-clamping the common and external carotid artery during dissection (pre-clamp method) decreased the rate of new DWI lesions compared to without pre-clamping (3.5 % vs. 7.5 %, P = 0.22). Occlusion time was significantly longer in the pre-clamp method than without pre-clamping (P < 0.0001). However, the incidence of SSEP < 50%, > 5 min was not increased with the pre-clamp method (p = 1.0) when using information regarding SSEP and collaterals to modify the speed of shunt manipulation. MRA asymmetry was identified in 39 CEAs (15.8 %) with correction of asymmetry postoperatively. MRA asymmetry correlated with symptomatic hyperperfusion (P = 0.0034). Only three CEAs had symptomatic hyperperfusion (1.2 %) with minimal symptoms. Ten CEAs sustained transient ischemia, symptomatic hyperperfusion, or 30-day-stroke (composite postoperative ischemic symptoms). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that SSEP < 50%, > 5 min (p = 0.009), new DWI lesions (p = 0.004) and MRA asymmetry (p = 0.042) were independent predictors ofaEuroEurocomposite postoperative ischemic symptoms.; SSEP < 50%, > 5 min, new DWI lesions, and MRA asymmetry were able to stratify the ischemic impacts in CEA. Meticulous routine shunting could mitigate those appropriately.

T2  -  PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS

N2  -  Parkinsonian syndromes associated with basal ganglia pathology have very rarely been reported in patients with end-stage renal failure. The nature and pathophysiology of the basal ganglia lesion responsible for parkinsonism were unknown. A 48-year-old man who had advanced renal failure developed disturbance of balance and gait and decreased spontaneity. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging disclosed bilateral basal ganglia lesions. By the finding of diffusion-weighted image, the apparent diffusion coefficient map, MR angiography, and SPECT, we suggest that the basal ganglia lesions may be the result of vasogenic edema attributable to focal hyperemia secondary to abnormal dilatation of small vessels.

N2  -  The preservation of language function during brain surgery still poses a challenge. No intraoperative methods have been established to monitor the language network reliably. We aimed to establish intraoperative language network monitoring by means of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). Subjects were six patients with tumors located close to the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in the language-dominant left hemisphere. Under general anesthesia, the anterior perisylvian language area (AL) was first defined by the CCEP connectivity patterns between the ventrolateral frontal and temporoparietal area, and also by presurgical neuroimaging findings. We then monitored the integrity of the language network by stimulating AL and by recording CCEPs from the posterior perisylvian language area (PL) consecutively during both general anesthesia and awake condition. High-frequency electrical stimulation (ES) performed during awake craniotomy confirmed language function at AL in all six patients. Despite an amplitude decline (<= 32%) in two patients, CCEP monitoring successfully prevented persistent language impairment. After tumor removal, single-pulse ES was applied to the white matter tract beneath the floor of the removal cavity in five patients, in order to trace its connections into the language cortices. In three patients in whom high-frequency ES of the white matter produced naming impairment, this "eloquent" subcortical site directly connected AL and PL, judging from the latencies and distributions of cortico- and subcortico-cortical evoked potentials. In conclusion, this study provided the direct evidence that AL, PL, and AF constitute the dorsal language network. Intraoperative CCEP monitoring is clinically useful for evaluating the integrity of the language network. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4345-4361, 2014. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to empirically test the effect of chemotherapy-induced tissue changes in a glioma model as measured by several diffusion indices calculated from nonmonoexponential formalisms over a wide range of b-values. We also compared these results to the conventional two-point apparent diffusion coefficient calculation using nominal b-values. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed over an extended range of b-values (120-4000 sec/mm(2)) on intracerebral rat 9L gliomas before and after a single dose of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. Diffusion indices from three formalisms of diffusion-weighted signal decay [(a) two-point analytical calculation using either low or high b-values, (b) a stretched exponential formalism, and (c) a biexponential fit] were tested for responsiveness to therapy-induced differences between control and treated groups. Diffusion indices sensitive to fast diffusion' produced the largest response to treatment, which resulted in significant differences between groups. These trends were not observed for 'slow diffusion' indices. Although the highest rate of response was observed from the biexponential formalism, this was not found to be significantly different from the conventional monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient method. In conclusion, parameters from the more complicated nonmonoexponential formalisms did not provide additional sensitivity to treatment response in this glioma model beyond that observed from the two-point conventional monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient method.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Preserving functionality is important during neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. Specialized centers also map further brain functions apart from motor and language functions, such as arithmetic processing (AP). The mapping of AP by navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) in healthy volunteers has been reported.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to correlate the results of mapping AP with functional patient outcomes.; METHODS: We included 26 patients with parietal brain tumors. Because of preoperative impairment of AP, mapping was not possible in 8 patients (31%). We stimulated 52 cortical sites by nrTMS while patients performed a calculation task. Preoperatively and postoperatively, patients underwent a standardized number-processing and calculation test (NPCT). Tumor resection was blinded to nrTMS results, and the change in NPCT performance was correlated to resected AP-positive spots as identified by nrTMS.; RESULTS: The resection of AP-positive sites correlated with a worsening of the postoperative NPCT result in 12 cases. In 3 cases, no AP-positive sites were resected and the postoperative NPCT result was similar to or better than preoperatively. Also, in 3 cases, the postoperative NPCT result was better than preoperatively, although AP-positive sites were resected.; CONCLUSIONS: Despite presenting only a few cases, nrTMS might be a useful tool for preoperative mapping of AP. However, the reliability of the present results has to be evaluated in a larger series and by intraoperative mapping data.

N2  -  Object. The aim of this study was better preoperative planning and direct application to intraoperative procedures through accurate coregistration of diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography results and anatomical three-dimensional magnetic resonance images and subsequent importation of the combined images to a neuronavigation system (functional neuronavigation).
Methods. Six patients with brain lesions adjacent to the corticospinal tract (CST) were studied. During surgery, direct fiber stimulation was used to evoke motor responses to confirm the accuracy of CST depicted on functional neuronavigation. In three patients, Stimulation of the supposed CST elicited the expected motor evoked potentials. In the other three, stimulation at the resection borders more than 1 cm away from the supposed CST showed no motor response. All patients underwent appropriate tumor resection with preservation of the CST.; Conclusions. Integration of the DT imaging-based tractography information into a traditional neuronavigation system demonstrated spatial relationships between lesions and the CST, allowing for the avoidance of tract injury during lesion resection. Direct fiber stimulation was used for real-time reliable white matter mapping, which served to adjust for any discrepancy between the neuronavigation system data and potentially shifted positions of the brain structures. The combination of these techniques enabled the authors to identify accurate positions of the CST during surgery and to accomplish optimal tumor resections.

N2  -  Diffuse malignant gliomas, the most common type of brain tumor, carry a dire prognosis and are poorly responsive to initial treatment. The response to treatment is typically evaluated by measurements obtained from radiographic images several months after the start of treatment; therefore, an early biomarker of tumor response would be useful for making early treatment decisions and for prognostic information. Thirty-four patients with malignant glioma were examined by diffusion MRI before treatment and 3 weeks later, These images were coregistered, and differences in tumor-water diffusion values were calculated as functional diffusion maps (MM), which were correlated with the radiographic response, time-to-progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Changes in fDM at 3 weeks were closely associated with the radiographic response at 10 weeks. The percentage of the tumor undergoing a significant change in the diffusion of water (V-T) was different between patients with progressive disease (PD) vs. stable disease (SD) (P < 0.001). Patients classified as PD by fDM analysis at 3 weeks were found to have a shorter TTP compared with SD (median TTP, 4.3 vs. 7.3 months; P < 0.04). By using fDM, early patient stratification also was correlated with shorter OS in the PD group compared with SD patients (median survival, 8.0 vs. 18.2 months; P < 0.01). On the basis of fDM, tumor assessment provided an early biomarker for response, TTP, and OS in patients with malignant glioma. Further evaluation of this technique is warranted to determine whether it may be useful in the individualization of treatment or evaluation of the response in clinical protocols.

N2  -  PurposeIn this cross-sectional, proof-of-concept study, we propose that using the more pathologically-specific neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) method, in conjunction with high-resolution probabilistic tractography, white matter tract templates can improve the assessment of regional axonal injury and its association with disability of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). MethodsParametric maps of the neurite density index, orientation dispersion index, and the apparent isotropic volume fraction (IVF) were estimated in 18 pwMS and nine matched healthy controls (HCs). Tract-specific values were measured in transcallosal (TC) fibers from the paracentral lobules and TC and corticospinal fibers from the ventral and dorsal premotor areas, presupplementary and supplementary motor areas, and primary motor cortex. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test assessed group differences in the NODDI-derived metrics; the Spearman's rank correlation analyses measured associations between the NODDI metrics and other clinical or radiological variables. ResultsIVF values of the TC fiber bundles from the paracentral, presupplementary, and supplementary motor areas were both higher in pwMS than in HCs (p <= 0.045) and in pwMS with motor disability compared to those without motor disability (p <= 0.049). IVF in several TC tracts was associated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale score (p <= 0.047), while regional and overall lesion burden correlated with the Timed 25-Foot Walking Test (p <= 0.049). ConclusionIVF alterations are present in pwMS even when the other NODDI metrics are still mostly preserved. Changes in IVF are biologically non-specific and may not necessarily drive irreversible functional loss. However, by possibly preceding downstream pathologies that are strongly associated with disability accretion, IVF changes are indicators of, otherwise, occult prelesional tissue injury.

N2  -  Objectives The objective of this study was to analyse MRI with morphological (T1, T2) and diffusion sequences (DWI, b1000) in patients presenting non-aggressive patterns of sinus opacity and operated on by functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Design A retrospective study. Setting Diffusion imaging in paranasal sinus pathology remains little known. To date, no imaging system is capable of determining the purulent content of a non-enhanced sinus filling. Participants We included consecutive patients having undergone FESS in whom MRI of the paranasal sinuses was performed. Subjects were allocated to Case (pus) or Control (no pus) groups depending on sinus content found intraoperatively. FESS was performed for bacterial acute rhinosinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis, non-purulent sinusitis, naso-sinusal polyposis, antrochoanal polyp, isolated polyp, angiomatous polyp and eosinophilic fungal sinusitis. Tumours, mucoceles and fungus balls were excluded. Main outcome measures We analysed T1, T2, b1000 and MRI sequences and ADC map. Results On univariate analysis, intermediate signal in T2 and high signal in b1000 were associated with Cases (P < 0.001) as were low ADC values (P < 0.001). The difference in mean ADC values between Cases and Controls was statistically significant (respectively, 0.518 vs 2.041 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, MRI with ADC brain was significantly associated with the case group. MRI with b1000_SI 1.450 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec was significantly associated with the control group. Conclusions Diffusion MRI offers extremely promising results regarding content characterisation of infectious sinus diseases.

N2  -  Initial experiences are reviewed in an integrated operation theater equipped with an intraoperative high-field (1.5 T) magnetic resonance (MR) imager and neuro-navigation (BrainSUITE (R)), to evaluate the indications and limitations. One hundred consecutive cases were treated, consisting of 38 gliomas, 49 other tumors, 11 cerebrovascular diseases, and 2 functional diseases. The feasibility and usefulness of the integrated theater were evaluated for individual diseases, focusing on whether intraoperative images (including diffusion tensor imaging) affected the surgical strategy. The extent of resection and outcomes in each histological category of brain tumors were examined. Intraoperative high-field MR imaging frequently affected or modified the surgical strategy in the glioma group (27/38 cases, 71.1%), but less in the other tumor group (13/49 cases, 26.5%). The surgical strategy was not modified in cerebrovascular or functional diseases, but the success of procedures and the absence of complications could be confirmed. In glioma surgery, subtotal or greater resection was achieved in 22 of the 31 patients (71%) excluding biopsies, and intraoperative images revealed tumor remnants resulting in the extension of resection in 21 of the 22 patients (95.4%), the highest rate of extension among all types of pathologies. The integrated neuro-navigation improved workflow. The best indication for intraoperative high-field MR imaging and integrated neuro-navigation is brain tumors, especially gliomas, and is supplementary in assuring quality in surgery for cerebrovascular or functional diseases. Immediate quality assurance is provided in several types of neurosurgical procedures.

N2  -  The relationship between biomechanical forces and neuropathology is key to understanding traumatic brain injury. White matter tracts are damaged by high shear forces during impact, resulting in axonal injury, a key determinant of long-term clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between biomechanical forces and patterns of white matter injuries, associated with persistent diffusion MRI abnormalities, is poorly understood. This limits the ability to predict the severity of head injuries and the design of appropriate protection. Our previously developed human finite element model of head injury predicted the location of post-traumatic neurodegeneration. A similar rat model now allows us to experimentally test whether strain patterns calculated by the model predicts in vivo MRI and histology changes. Using a controlled cortical impact, mild and moderate injuries (1 and 2 mm) were performed. Focal and axonal injuries were quantified with volumetric and diffusion 9.4 T MRI at 2 weeks post injury. Detailed analysis of the corpus callosum was conducted using multi-shell diffusion MRI and histopathology. Microglia and astrocyte density, including process parameters, along with white matter structural integrity and neurofilament expression were determined by quantitative immunohistochemistry. Linear mixed effects regression analyses for strain and strain rate with the employed outcome measures were used to ascertain how well immediate biomechanics could explain MRI and histology changes. The spatial pattern of mechanical strain and strain rate in the injured cortex shows good agreement with the probability maps of focal lesions derived from volumetric MRI. Diffusion metrics showed abnormalities in the corpus callosum, indicating white matter changes in the segments subjected to high strain, as predicted by the model. The same segments also exhibited a severity-dependent increase in glia cell density, white matter thinning and reduced neurofilament expression. Linear mixed effects regression analyses showed that mechanical strain and strain rate were significant predictors of in vivo MRI and histology changes. Specifically, strain and strain rate respectively explained 33% and 28% of the reduction in fractional anisotropy, 51% and 29% of the change in neurofilament expression and 51% and 30% of microglia density changes. The work provides evidence that strain and strain rate in the first milliseconds after injury are important factors in determining patterns of glial and axonal injury and serve as experimental validators of our computational model of traumatic brain injury. Our results provide support for the use of this model in understanding the relationship of biomechanics and neuropathology and can guide the development of head protection systems, such as airbags and helmets.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine common structural and functional networks associated with asymmetric step length after unilateral ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Thirty-nine chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups, based on the presence or absence of asymmetric step length. In each group, each lesion was mapped onto a brain magnetic resonance image. The structural and functional networks of brain regions connected to each lesion were identified using a public diffusion tensor and resting state function magnetic resonance image dataset. To identify brain regions associated with asymmetric step length, we conducted voxel-wise independent sample t-tests for structural and function lesion network maps.; RESULTS: At least 85% of lesions showed functional network overlap in the bilateral frontal lobe. Functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the contralesional hemisphere was significantly decreased in group 1 compared to that in group 2.; CONCLUSIONS: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have an important role in compensating for an asymmetric step length after a unilateral stroke.

N2  -  Background and purpose. - Among principal MRI sequences used for a better pre-therapeutic characterization of glioblastoma (GBM), DWI-derived ADC is expected to be a good parameter for the evaluation of cellularity, due to restricted water diffusivity. We aimed here to compare ADC maps to (FLT)-F-18-PET, a proliferation tracer, in GBM cases.
Materials and methods. - Patients underwent (FLT)-F-18-PET, followed by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) just prior to surgery. We analysed in this study twenty GBM confirmed patients. The 5th percentile (5p) of the ADC values were thresholded to define the ADC(min) ROI, while the 95th percentile (95p) of the SUV FLT values were used to define the FLTmax ROI. The statistical and spatial correlations between these two groups of ROIs were analyzed.; Results. - We did not observe any significant correlations between ADC(min) and FLTmax cut-off values (R-2 = 0.0285), neither between ADC(min) and FLTmax ROIs (mean Dice = 0.09 +- 0.12). Mean ADC values in the FLTmax defined ROI were significantly higher than the values in the ADC(min) ROI (P < 0.001). Mean FLT values in the FLTmax ROI were significantly higher than the values in the ADC(min) ROI (P < 0.001).; Conclusions. - When comparing ADC maps to (FLT)-F-18 uptake, we did not observe significant anatomical overlap nor correlation, between the regions of low ADC and high FLT disabling to clearly link ADC values to cellular proliferation. The exact significance of ADC maps in GBM has yet to be elaborated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  It remains unclear whether tractography of pyramidal tracts is correlated with the intraoperative direct electrical subcortical stimulation (DESS), and brain shift further complicates the issue. The objective of this research is to quantitatively verify the correlation between optimized tractography (OT) of pyramidal tracts after brain shift compensation and DESS during brain tumor surgery. OT was performed for 20 patients with lesions in proximity to the pyramidal tracts based on preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. During surgery, tumor resection was guided by DESS. A total of 168 positive stimulation points and their corresponding stimulation intensity thresholds were recorded. Using the brain shift compensation algorithm based on hierarchical B-spline grids combined with a Gaussian resolution pyramid, we warped the preoperative pyramidal tract models and used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to investigate the reliability of our brain shift compensation method based on anatomic landmarks. Additionally, the minimum distance between the DESS points and warped OT (wOT) model was measured and correlated with DESS intensity threshold. Brain shift compensation was achieved in all cases, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.96 in the registration accuracy analysis. The minimum distance between the DESS points and the wOT model was found to have a significantly high correlation with the DESS stimulation intensity threshold (r=0.87, P<0.001), with a linear regression coefficient of 0.96. Our OT method can provide comprehensive and accurate visualization of the pyramidal tracts for neurosurgical navigation and was quantitatively verified by intraoperative DESS after brain shift compensation.

N2  -  In Germany more than one million inhabitants suffer from glaucoma, more than 100,000 are threatened with blindness because glaucoma is often diagnosed too late or not at all. Diagnosis and monitoring is usually carried out "only" by examination of the retina and not the whole visual pathway. However, the eye is just "the tip of the iceberg" of the actual visual pathway, which extends through the brain to the visual cortex. The interdisciplinary holistic assessment of the whole visual pathway in glaucoma is of crucial importance because glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Subtypes, such as normal tension glaucoma (NTG), seem to originate from primary damage to the intracranial visual pathway with secondary retrograde retinal degeneration. Recent studies including glaucoma patients and healthy controls could show that diffusion tensor imaging with calculation of diffusion coefficients, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean and radial diffusivity (MD and RD) as markers of axonal integrity, provide the potential to assess the intracranial visual pathway with a high correlation to established ophthalmological examinations. In particular, calculation of FA maps of the visual pathway and accompanying voxel-based approaches, can be integrated into clinical routine. Thus, detection of glaucoma-related intracranial alterations, even in early stages of the disease, as well as differentiation of different glaucoma subtypes, is made possible. Furthermore, the diagnosis of normal tension glaucoma seems to be possible much earlier with these new imaging techniques compared to established ophthalmological work-up. Moreover, holistic imaging provides new insights into the pathophysiology of this form of glaucoma. This review article gives an overview of these novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques for assessment of the visual pathway in glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy and reveals the potential of an interdisciplinary approach.

N2  -  Functional neurological changes after surgery combined with data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies can provide direct evidence of anatomical localization of brain function. The goal of the present study was to characterize mechanisms of spatial neglect using these techniques by analyzing two patients with development or worsening of left neglect after surgery a tour hospital in 2008. In both cases, the surgical approach was via the right inferior parietal lobes, and damage to the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) was demonstrated after surgery by DTI tractography. By contrast, neither the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) nor the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was damaged. These results suggest that damage to the right SLF in the inferior parietal lobe plays a critical role in the development of spatial neglect. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objectives The aim of this work was investigating the methods based on coupling cerebral perfusion (ASL) and amino acid metabolism ([F-18]DOPA-PET) measurements to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI in glioma follow-up. Methods Images were acquired using a 3-T PET/MR system, on a prospective cohort of patients addressed for possible glioma progression. Data were preprocessed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), including registration on T1-weighted images, spatial and intensity normalization, and tumor segmentation. As index tests, tumor isocontour maps of [F-18]DOPA-PET and ASL T-maps were created and metabolic/perfusion abnormalities were evaluated with the asymmetry index z-score. SPM map analysis of significant size clusters and semi-quantitative PET and ASL map evaluation were performed and compared to the gold standard diagnosis. Lastly, ASL and PET topography of significant clusters was compared to that of the initial tumor. Results Fifty-eight patients with unilateral treated glioma were included (34 progressions and 24 pseudo-progressions). The tumor isocontour maps and T-maps showed the highest specificity (100%) and sensitivity (94.1%) for ASL and [F-18]DOPA analysis, respectively. The sensitivity of qualitative SPM maps and semi-quantitative rCBF and rSUV analyses were the highest for glioblastoma. Conclusion Tumor isocontour T-maps and combined analysis of CBF and [F-18]DOPA-PET uptake allow achieving high diagnostic performance in differentiating between progression and pseudo-progression in treated gliomas. The sensitivity is particularly high for glioblastomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification is a common molecular event in glioblastomas. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential usefulness of morphologic and diffusion MR imaging signs in the prediction of epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification status in patients with glioblastoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed pretreatment MR imaging scans from 147 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and correlated MR imaging features with tumor epidermal growth factor receptor amplification status. The following morphologic tumor MR imaging features were qualitatively assessed: 1) border sharpness, 2) cysticnecrotic change, 3) hemorrhage, 4) T2-isointense signal, 5) restricted water diffusion, 6) nodular enhancement, 7) subependymal enhancement, and 8) multifocal discontinuous enhancement. A total of 142 patients had DWI available for quantitative analysis. ADC maps were calculated, and the ADC(mean), ADC(min), ADC(max), ADC(ROI), and ADC(ratio) were measured.; RESULTS: Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification was present in 60 patients (40.8%) and absent in 87 patients (59.2%). Restricted water diffusion correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor amplification (P = .04), whereas the other 7 morphologic MR imaging signs did not (P > .12). Quantitative DWI analysis found that all ADC measurements correlated with epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, with the highest correlations found with ADC(ROI) (P = .0003) and ADC(mean) (P = .0007).; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a role for diffusion MR imaging in the determination of epidermal growth factor receptor amplification status in glioblastoma. Additional work is necessary to confirm these results and isolate new imaging biomarkers capable of noninvasively characterizing the molecular status of these tumors.

N2  -  BackgroundPerioperative assessment of language function in brain tumor patients commonly relies on administration of object naming during stimulation mapping. Ample research, however, points to the benefit of adding verb tasks to the testing paradigm in order to delineate and preserve postoperative language function more comprehensively. This research uses a case series approach to explore the feasibility and added value of a dual-task protocol that includes both a noun task (object naming) and a verb task (action naming) in perioperative delineation of language functions. Materials and MethodsSeven neurosurgical cases underwent perioperative language assessment with both object and action naming. This entailed preoperative baseline testing, preoperative stimulation mapping with navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) with subsequent white matter visualization, intraoperative mapping with Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) in 4 cases, and postoperative imaging and examination of language change. ResultsWe observed a divergent pattern of language organization and decline between cases who showed lesions close to the delineated language network and hence underwent DES mapping, and those that did not. The latter displayed no new impairment postoperatively consistent with an unharmed network for the neural circuits of both object and action naming. For the cases who underwent DES, on the other hand, a higher sensitivity was found for action naming over object naming. Firstly, action naming preferentially predicted the overall language state compared to aphasia batteries. Secondly, it more accurately predicted intraoperative positive language areas as revealed by DES. Thirdly, double dissociations between postoperatively unimpaired object naming and impaired action naming and vice versa indicate segregated skills and neural representation for noun versus verb processing, especially in the ventral stream. Overlaying postoperative imaging with object and action naming networks revealed that dual-task nTMS mapping can explain the drop in performance in those cases where the network appeared in proximity to the resection cavity. ConclusionUsing a dual-task protocol for visualization of cortical and subcortical language areas through nTMS mapping proved to be able to capture network-to-deficit relations in our case series. Ultimately, adding action naming to clinical nTMS and DES mapping may help prevent postoperative deficits of this seemingly segregated skill.

N2  -  Meningiomas are very common neurosurgical problem. Their histological appearance, different size and localization, adherence to vital neural and vascular structures or extensive peritumoral brain edema (PTBE), especially in deep seated tumors, may lead to severe, life-threatening complications. We report a case of tuberculum sellae meningioma (TSM). A 48-year old female presented with 7-month history of blurred vision and progressive visual impairment. Intracranial tumor was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After ophtalmological and endocrinological evaluation, the patient underwent surgical removal of the tumor. She immediately recovered from her visual disturbances and no tumor recurrences were seen during follow-up. Pathological diagnosis showed a meningioma of the secretory subtype (MS). We discuss the role of immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis and the role of different factors in the PTBE formation. Selection of surgical route to the TSM is discussed, as well. Review of the literature is presented.

N2  -  Background: Lesion studies have shown distinct roles for the hippocampus, with the dorsal subregion being involved in processing of spatial information and memory, and the ventral aspect coding for emotion and motivational behaviour. However, its structural connectivity with the subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the executive area of the brain that also has various distinct functions, has not been fully explored, especially in the Malaysian population.
Methods: We performed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with probabilistic tractography on four Malay males to parcellate the hippocampus according to its relative connection probability to the six subdivisions of the PFC.; Results: Our findings revealed that each hippocampus showed putative connectivity to all the subdivisions of PFC, with the highest connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Parcellation of the hippocampus according to its connection probability to the six PFC subdivisions showed variability in the pattern of the connection distribution and no clear distinction between the hippocampal subregions.; Conclusion: Hippocampus displayed highest connectivity to the OFC as compared to other PFC subdivisions. We did not find a unifying pattern of distribution based on the connectivity-based parcellation of the hippocampus.

N2  -  Our aim was to assess the diagnostic performance of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging for differentiating high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from low-grade gliomas (LGGs).
Forty-five patients with diffuse glioma (age 50.9 +- 20.4 y; 26 males, 19 females) were assessed with IVIM imaging using 13 b-values (0-1000 smm(2)) at 3T. The perfusion fraction (f), true diffusion coefficient (D), and pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated by fitting the bi-exponential model. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was obtained with 2 b-values (0 and 1000 smm(2)). Relative cerebral blood volume was measured by the dynamic susceptibility contrast method. Two observers independently measured D, ADC, D*, and f, and these measurements were compared between the LGG group (n = 16) and the HGG group (n = 29).; Both D (1.26 +- 0.37 mm(2)s in LGG, 0.94 +- 0.19 mm(2)s in HGG; P < .001) and ADC (1.28 +- 0.35 mm(2)s in LGG, 1.03 +- 0.19 mm(2)s in HGG; P < .01) were lower in the HGG group. D was lower than ADC in the LGG (P < .05) and HGG groups (P < .0001). D* was not different between the groups. The f-values were significantly larger in HGG (17.5 +- 6.3%) than in LGG (5.8 +- 3.8%; P < .0001) and correlated with relative cerebral blood volume (r = 0.85; P < .0001). Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed areas under curve of 0.95 with f, 0.78 with D, 0.73 with ADC, and 0.60 with D*.; IVIM imaging is useful in differentiating HGGs from LGGs.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The potential morbidity of cerebral ischemia after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been recognized, but its reported incidence varies widely. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the development of cerebral ischemic complications in patients treated by CEA at a high-volume cerebrovascular center.
METHODS: Fifty patients with moderate or severe carotid stenosis awaiting CEA were studied with perioperative diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain and standardized neurological evaluations. Microsurgical CEA was performed by 1 of 2 vascular neurosurgeons. Radiological studies were evaluated by faculty neuroradiologists who were blinded to the details of the clinical situation.; RESULTS: Preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging studies were performed within 24 hours of surgery. A second study was obtained within 24 (92% of patients), 48 (4% of patients), or 72 (4% of patients) hours after surgery. Intraluminal shunting was used in 1 patient (2%), and patch angioplasty was used in 2 patients (4%). No patient had diffusion-weighted imaging evidence of procedure-related cerebral ischemia. Nonischemic complications consisted of postoperative confusion in an 87-year-old man with a urinary tract infection and a marginal mandibular nerve paresis in another patient. Radiological studies were normal in both patients.; CONCLUSION: CEA is a relatively safe procedure that may be performed with an acceptable risk of cerebral ischemia in select patients. The low rate of ischemic complications associated with CEA sets a standard to which other carotid revascularization techniques should be held. The current results are presented with a discussion of the senior author's preferred surgical technique and a brief review of the literature.

N2  -  Purpose To evaluate two distortion correction techniques for diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging (DW-ssEPI) on a 0.35 T magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) system.
Methods The effects of sequence optimization through enabling parallel imaging (PI) and selecting appropriate bandwidth on spatial distortion were first evaluated on the 0.35 T MRgRT system using a spatial integrity phantom. Field map (FM) and reversed gradient (RG) corrections were then performed on the optimized protocol to further reduce distortion. An open-source toolbox was used to quantify the spatial displacement before and after distortion correction. To evaluate ADC accuracy and repeatability of the optimized protocol, as well as impacts of distortion correction on ADC values, the optimized protocol was scanned twice on a diffusion phantom. The calculated ADC values were compared with reference ADCs using paired t-test. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two repetitions, as well as between before and after FMRG correction was calculated to evaluate ADC repeatability and effects of distortion correction. Six patients were recruited to assess the in-vivo performance. The optimal distortion correction technique was identified by visual assessment. To quantify distortion reduction, tumor and critical structures were contoured on the turbo spin echo (TSE) image (reference image), the DW-ssEPI image, and the distortion corrected images independently by two radiation oncologists. Mean distance to agreement (MDA) and DICE coefficient between contours on the reference images and the diffusion images were calculated. Tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from the original DW-ssEPI images and the distortion corrected images were compared using Bland-Altman analysis.; Results Sequence optimization played a vital role in improving the spatial integrity, and spatial distortion was proportional to the total readout time. Before the correction, distortion of the optimized protocol (PI and high bandwidth) was 1.50 +- 0.89 mm in a 100 mm radius and 2.21 +- 1.39 mm in a 175 mm radius for the central plane. FM corrections reduced the distortions to 0.42 +- 0.27 mm and 0.67 +- 0.49 mm respectively, and RG reduced distortion to 0.40 +- 0.22 mm and 0.64 +- 0.47 mm, respectively. The optimized protocol provided accurate and repeatable ADC quantification on the diffusion phantom. The calculated ADC values were consistent before and after FMRG correction. For the patient study, the FM correction was unable to reduce chemical shift artifacts whereas the RG method successfully mitigated the chemical shift. MDA reduced from 2.52 +- 1.29 mm to 1.11 +- 0.72 mm after the RG correction. The DICE coefficient increased from 0.80 +- 0.13 to 0.91 +- 0.06. A Bland-Altman plot showed that there was a good agreement between ADC measurements before and after application of the RG correction.; Conclusion Two distortion correction techniques were evaluated on a commercial low-field MRgRT system. Overall, the RG correction was able to drastically improve spatial distortion and preserve ADC accuracy.

N2  -  Introduction: Diffusion-weighted imaging in stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM-DWI) is an interesting alternative with less susceptibility artifacts compared to the most commonly used diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI-DWI). Sensitivity and specificity of a novel STEAM-DWI, described by Merrem et al. 2017 [1], were assessed in patients with ischemic stroke.
Methods: EPI- and STEAM-DWIs were performed in patients with suspected subacute stroke between 01 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 using 3-T MRI. Three neuroradiologists independently and separately rated STEAM-DWI images with respect to (i) signs of an acutesubacute stroke, (ii) the number, size and localization of infarctions and, (iii) the presence of artifacts.; Results: In 55 (23 right, 23 left, 9 both hemispheres) of 85 patients a subacute stroke was confirmed using EPIDWI. The cerebral vascular territories were affected as follows: anterior cerebral artery 8 %, middle cerebral artery 48 %, posterior cerebral artery 27 %, brainstem 7 %, cerebellum 10 %. In 53 of 55 (96 %) cases the stroke was detected by usage of STEAM-DWI, in 35 of 37 patients microembolic events were noticed (95 %).; Results showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % (7070) for major infarcts (>9 mm(2) in-plane) and a sensitivity of up to 94 % (121129) for detecting subacute microembolic lesions. No susceptibility artifacts were noticed in STEAM-DWI.; Conclusion: Compared to standard EPI-DWI, STEAM-DWI offers a more robust alternative for diagnosing subacute strokes in areas affected by susceptibility artifacts.

N2  -  Purpose: Tumor grading is very important both in treatment decision and evaluation of prognosis. While tissue samples are obtained as part of most therapeutic approaches, factors that may result in inaccurate grading due to sampling error (namely, heterogeneity in tissue sampling, as well as tumor-grade heterogeneity within the same tumor specimen), have led to a desire to use imaging better to ascertain tumor grade. The purpose in our study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy of diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) or both in grading primary cerebral gliomas.
Materials and methods: We performed conventional MR imaging (MR), DWI, and MRSI in 74 patients with newly diagnosed brain gliomas: 59 patients had histologically verified high-grade gliomas: 37 glioblastomas multiform (GBM) and 22 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and 15 patients had low-grade gliomas. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tumor and peritumoral edema, and ADC ratios (ADC in tumor or peritumoral edema to ADC of contralateral white matter, as well as ADC in tumor to ADC in peritumoral edema) were determined from three regions of interest. The average of the mean, maximum, and minimum for ADC variables was calculated for each patient. The metabolite ratios of ChoCr and ChoNAA at intermediate TE were assessed from spectral maps in the solid portion of tumor, peritumoral edema and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Tumor grade determined with the two methods was then compared with that from histopathologic grading. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to determine optimum thresholds for tumor grading. Measures of diagnostic examination performance, such as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC, and accuracy for identifying high-grade gliomas were also calculated.; Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated a threshold minimum ADC tumor value of 1.07 to provide sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 79.7%, 60.0%, 88.7%, and 42.9% respectively, in determining high-grade gliomas. Threshold values of 1.35 and 1.78 for peritumoral ChoCr and ChoNAA metabolite ratios resulted in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 83.3%, 85.1%, 41.7%, 97.6%, and 100%, 57.4%, 23.1% and 100% respectively for determining high-grade gliomas. Significant differences were noted in the ADC tumor values and ratios, peritumoral ChoCr and ChoNAA metabolite ratios, and tumoral ChoNAA ratio between low-and high-grade gliomas. The combination of mean ADC tumor value, maximum ADC tumor ratio, peritumoral ChoCr and ChoNAA metabolite ratios resulted in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 91.5%, 100%, 100% and 60% respectively.; Conclusion: Combining DWI and MRSI increases the accuracy of preoperative imaging in the determination of glioma grade. MRSI had superior diagnostic performance in predicting glioma grade compared with DWI alone. The predictive values are helpful in the clinical decision-making process to evaluate the histologic grade of tumors, and provide a means of guiding treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-restricted lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are detected in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this study, we aimed to determine the fate of DWI lesions in ICH patients and whether the presence of DWI lesions is associated with functional outcome in patients with ICH.
Methods: This prospective study enrolled 153 patients with acute ICH. Baseline MRI scans were performed within 2 weeks after ICH to detect DWI lesions and imaging markers for small vessel disease (SVD). Follow-up MRI scans were performed at 3 months after ICH to assess the fate of the DWI lesions. We analyzed the associations between the characteristics of DWI lesions with clinical features and functional outcome.; Results: Seventeen of the 153 patients (11.1%) had a total of 25 DWI lesions. Factors associated with DWI lesions were high initial systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at the emergency room, additional lowering of MAP within 24 hours, and the presence of white matter hyperintensity and cerebral microbleeds. Thirteen of the 25 DWI lesions (52%) were not visible on follow-up T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and were associated with high apparent diffusion coefficient value and a sharper decease in MAP. The regression of DWI lesions was associated with good functional outcome.; Conclusions: More than half of the DWI lesions in the ICH patients did not transition to visible, long-term infarction. Only if the DWI lesion finally transitioned to final infarction was a poor functional outcome predicted. A DWI lesion may be regarded as an ischemic change of SVD and does not always indicate certain cerebral infarction or permanent tissue injury.

N2  -  Diffusion imaging has shown promise as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in glioma. We assessed the ability of graded functional diffusion maps (fDMs) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) characteristics to predict overall survival (OS) in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients treated with bevacizumab. Seventy-seven patients with recurrent GBMs were retrospectively examined. MRI scans were obtained before and approximately 6 weeks after treatment with bevacizumab. Graded fDMs were created by registering data-sets to each patient's pretreatment scan and then performing voxel-wise subtraction between post- and pretreatment ADC maps. Voxels were categorized according to the degree of change in ADC within pretreatment fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast-enhancing regions of interest (ROIs). We found that the volume of tissue showing decreased ADC within both FLAIR and contrast-enhancing regions stratified OS (log-rank, P < .05). fDMs applied to contrast-enhancing ROIs more accurately predicted OS compared with fDMs applied to FLAIR ROIs. Graded fDMs (showing voxels with decreased ADC between 0.25 and 0.4 mu m(2)/ms) were more predictive of OS than traditional (single threshold) fDMs, and the predictive ability of graded fDMs could be enhanced even further by adding the ADC characteristics from the fDM-classified voxels to the analysis (log-rank, P < .001). These results demonstrate that spatially resolved diffusion-based tumor metrics are a powerful imaging biomarker of survival in patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab.

N2  -  Objective: We aimed to identify brain changes associated with preserved cognitive function in patients with chronic brainstem stroke.
Methods: Twelve patients with chronic brainstem stroke and 24 age-matched healthy controls were included in this retrospective study. All participants underwent T1-weighted, diffusion tensor, and resting-state functional MRI. Gray matter density, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity maps from diffusion tensor imaging and seven cognition-related independent component maps from resting-state functional MRI were used to identify differences in brain volume, structural connectivity, and functional connectivity. Independent t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of changes in gray matter density, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and inter-network functional connectivity maps.; Results: Bilateral cerebellum volumes and structural connectivity of the diffuse bilateral cerebral hemispheres were significantly lower in the patient than in the control group. However, patients exhibited increased gray matter volume and increased structural connectivity of the temporal lobe in the contra-lesional hemisphere and basal forebrain, compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the intra-network functional connectivity in the frontal and temporal lobes was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P-FWE < 0.05).; Conclusion: In the patient group, the brain regions mainly associated with the cholinergic system exhibited increased volume, structural connectivity, and functional connectivity. In contrast, the regions connected with the brainstem via cortico-ponto-cerebellar fibers exhibited decreased volume or structural connectivity. Cognitive function may be preserved in patients with brainstem stroke due to significant increases in frontal and temporal inter-network connectivity. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health. Inc.

N2  -  New fast-imaging MRI systems designed specifically for cardiac magnetic resonance enable new applications of noninvasive vascular imaging. The use of functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to map brain function and structure offers a new dimension to an understanding of the human condition. Clinical applications of functional MRI will influence many specialties including surgery, education, and rehabilitation. Functional imaging has the potential to visualize the regional concentration of specific proteins. This imaging at the level of molecules may be possible by use of a contrast material whose signal is changed by local enzymatic activity.
The three-dimensional digital data collected in modern imaging techniques allow for virtual endoscopy in the respiratory, alimentary, and cardiovascular systems. Virtual endoscopy may replace many of the more invasive diagnostic methods in the near future. The measurement of clinical decision-making through observer performance studies better informs both the physician and the patient on how to improve upon the quality of clinical practice. These prospects for progress reinforce diagnostic imaging as a cornerstone in medical informatics. The history of creating images used in medicine reveals the invention of diagnostic tools which may provide new information but premature use can result in improper application of a poorly understood technology. Research into the use of new technology may be as important as the technology itself in improving the human condition.

N2  -  Ventriculomegaly (expansion of the brain's fluid-filled ventricles), a condition commonly found in the aging brain, results in areas of gliosis where the ependymal cells are replaced with dense astrocytic patches. Loss of ependymal cells would compromise trans-ependymal bulk flow mechanisms required for clearance of proteins and metabolites from the brain parenchyma. However, little is known about the interplay between age-related ventricle expansion, the decline in ependymal integrity, altered periventricular fluid homeostasis, abnormal protein accumulation and cognitive impairment. In collaboration with the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we analyzed longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subject-matched fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI and periventricular biospecimens to map spatiotemporally the progression of ventricle expansion and associated periventricular edema and loss of transependymal exchange functions in healthy aging individuals and those with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. We found that the trajectory of ventricle expansion and periventricular edema progression correlated with degree of cognitive impairment in both speed and severity, and confirmed that areas of expansion showed ventricle surface gliosis accompanied by edema and periventricular accumulation of protein aggregates, suggesting impaired clearance mechanisms in these regions. These findings reveal pathophysiological outcomes associated with normal brain aging and cognitive impairment, and indicate that a multifactorial analysis is best suited to predict and monitor cognitive decline.

N2  -  Recent clinical trials of new revascularization therapies in acute ischemic stroke have highlighted the importance of physiological imaging to identify optimal treatments for patients. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is a hallmark of at-risk tissue in stroke, and can be quantified from the susceptibility effect of deoxyhemoglobin molecules in venous blood on MRI phase scans. We measured OEF within cerebral veins using advanced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI reconstructions in 20 acute stroke patients. Absolute OEF was elevated in the affected (29.3 +/- 3.4%) versus the contralateral hemisphere (25.5 +/- 3.1%) of patients with large diffusion-perfusion lesion mismatch (P = 0.032). In these patients, OEF negatively correlated with relative CBF measured by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (P = 0.004), suggesting compensation for reduced flow. Patients with perfusion-diffusion match or no hypo-perfusion showed less OEF difference between hemispheres. Nine patients received longitudinal assessment and showed OEF ratio (affected to contralateral) of 1.2 +/- 0.1 at baseline that normalized (decreased) to 1.0 +/- 0.1 at follow-up three days later (P = 0.03). Our feasibility study demonstrates that QSM MRI can non-invasively quantify OEF in stroke patients, relates to perfusion status, and is sensitive to OEF changes over time.

N2  -  We present five new cases of van der Knaap's leukoencephalopathy, which is a rare abnormality characterized by infantile-onset white matter disease with swelling and mild clinical course. Based on the very rare histopathological data, this disease is considered a vacuolating myelinopathy with peripherally located intralamellar vacuoli. Although approximately 70 cases have so far been published, there are very limited data in the literature regarding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings of this recently discovered entity. In this paper, in addition to MRI, MRS and DWI findings in three patients are shown, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are calculated, and ADC measurements made from various regions of interest are documented. MRI showed diffuse swelling and areas of T2 high signal in supratentorial white matter, sparing the cortex and central gray matter structures. MRS findings indicated some degree of neuronal loss. DWI and ADC maps showed increased diffusion rates, suggesting a different type of tissue damage than that would be expected in vacuolating myelinopathies. We believe that DWI and ADC mapping would be of help in providing a baseline for monitoring the progression of the disease.

N2  -  Here we investigate the utility of a dual-echo Echo-Planar Imaging (DE-EPI) Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) approach to improve lesion conspicuity in pediatric imaging. This method delivers two 'echo images' for one diffusion-preparation period. We also demonstrate how the echoes can be utilized to remove transmit/receive coil-induced and static magnetic field intensity modulations on both echo images, which often mimic pathology and thereby pose diagnostic challenges. DE-EPI DWI data were acquired in 18 pediatric patients with abnormal diffusion lesions, and 46 pediatric patient controls at 3T. Echo1 [TE = 45ms] and Echo2 [TE = 86ms] were corrected for signal intensity variation across the images by exploiting the images equivalent coil-sensitivity and susceptibility-induced modulations. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed Echo1 and Echo2 and their intensity-corrected variants (cEcho1 and cEcho2) on a 7-point Likert scale, with grading on lesion conspicuity diagnostic confidence. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map from Echo1 was used to validate presence of true pathology. Echo2 was unanimously favored over Echo1 for its sensitivity for detecting acute brain injury, with a mean respective lesion conspicuity of 5.7/4.4 (p < 0.005) and diagnostic confidence of 5.1/4.3 (p = 0.025). cEcho2 was rated higher than cEcho1, with a mean respective lesion conspicuity of 5.5/4.3 (p < 0.005) and diagnostic confidence of 5.4/4.4 (p < 0.005). cEcho2 was favored over all echoes for its diagnostic reliability, particularly in regions close to the head coil. This work concludes that DE-EPI DWI is a useful alternative to conventional single-echo EPI DWI, whereby Echo2 and cEcho2 allows for improved lesion detection and overall higher diagnostic confidence.

N2  -  Subject motion during diffusion-weighted interleaved echo-planar imaging causes k-space offsets which lead to irregular sampling in the phase-encode direction. For each image, the k-space shifts are monitored using 2D navigator echoes, and are shown to lead to a frequent violation of the Nyquist condition when an ungated sequence is used on seven subjects. Combining data from four repeat acquisitions allows the Nyquist condition to be satisfied in all but 1% of images. Reconstruction of the irregularly-sampled data can be performed using a matrix inversion technique, The repeated acquisitions make the inversion more stable and additionally improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The resultant isotropic diffusion-weighted images and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps show high resolution and enable clear localization of a stroke lesion, Residual ADC artifacts with a slow spatial variation are observed and assumed to originate from non-rigid pulsatile brain motion.

N2  -  Purpose T2-weighted signal hyperintensities in white matter (WM) are a diagnostic finding in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). In our systematic investigation of the evolution of T2-hyperintensities in patients with the late-infantile form, we describe and characterize T2-pseudonormalization in the advanced stage of the natural disease course. Methods The volume of T2-hyperintensities was quantified in 34 MRIs of 27 children with late-infantile MLD (median age 2.25 years, range 0.5-5.2 years). In three children with the most advanced clinical course (age >4 years) and for whom the T2-pseudonormalization was the most pronounced, WM microstructure was investigated using a multimodal MRI protocol, including diffusion-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopy (MRS), myelin water fraction (MWF), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T1-mapping and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Results T2-hyperintensities in cerebral WM returned to normal in large areas of 3 patients in the advanced disease stage. Multimodal assessment of WM microstructure in areas with T2-pseudonormalization revealed highly decreased values for NAA, neurite density, isotropic water, mean and radial kurtosis, MWF and MTR, as well as increased radial diffusivity. Conclusion In late-infantile MLD patients, we found T2-pseudonormalization in WM tissue with highly abnormal microstructure characterizing the most advanced disease stage. Pathological hallmarks might be a loss of myelin, but also neuronal loss as well as increased tissue density due to gliosis and accumulated storage material. These results suggest that a multimodal MRI protocol using more specific microstructural parameters than T2-weighted sequences should be used when evaluating the effect of treatment trials in MLD.

N2  -  Background: The risk of surgery in eloquent areas is related to neuropsychological dysfunctions. Maximizing the extent of resection increases the overall survival. The onco-functional balance is mandatory when surgery involves cognitive areas, and maximal information on the cognitive status of patients during awake surgery is needed. This can be achieved using direct cortical stimulation mapping and, in addition to this, a neuropsychological monitoring technique called real-time neuropsychological testing (RTNT). The RTNT includes testing protocols based on the area where the surgery is performed. We reported on tests used for left temporal lobe surgery and our RTNT decision tree.Case Report: We reported our RTNT experience with a 25-year-old right-handed man with 13 years of schooling. He reported daily partial seizures. MRI revealed the presence of a low-grade glioma involving the temporo-insular cortex. The neuropsychological status presurgery which was within the normal range was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) information. Awake surgery plus RTNT was performed. Direct electrical stimulation during object naming elicited a motor speech arrest. Resection was continuously accompanied by the RTNT. The RTNT provided enriched information to the surgeon. Performance never dropped. A slight decrement in accuracy emerged for pseudoword repetition, short-term memory and working memory, phonological processing, and verbal comprehension. Total resection was performed, and the histological examination confirmed the nature of the lesion. Immediate postsurgery performance was within the normal range as it was the fMRI and DTI assessment.Conclusion: The RTNT provides essential information that can be used online, during surgery, for clinical aims to provide the surgeon with useful feedback on the cognitive status of patients.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an advanced technique more specific to irreversible ischemic injury than conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). However, its clinical translation has been limited by a long acquisition time and complex postprocessing. Methods A fast DKI sequence (3 minutes) was implemented on a 3T MRI (Siemens Trio) and piloted as part of an inpatient brain MRI protocol. Mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were postprocessed automatically at the scanner console and sent to the Picture Archiving and Communications System. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients in a 5-month period with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. MK and MD of the ischemic infarcts and contralateral normal brain were measured, and lesion volumes were measured in large infarcts using semiautomated segmentation. Results Twenty-two patients were included in the study (median age 66). The median time from last known well to MRI was 37 hours. MD and MK maps were successfully processed and demonstrated acute infarction in concordance with DWI in all cases. Infarcted regions had higher MK and lower MD compared to contralateral normal-appearing regions. MK lesion volume was significantly smaller than MD volume. Conclusion In this pilot study, we demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating a fast DKI sequence into a clinical MRI protocol. Acute infarcts were depicted on kurtosis maps, and MK lesion volumes were smaller than MD, in accordance with prior works. Future studies are needed to determine the role of DKI in acute stroke treatment selection and prognostication.

N2  -  BACKGROUND This prospective study employs anisotropic diffusion-weighted (ADW) magnetic resonance imaging for the integration of individual spatial information concerning the principal motor pathways into the operating room during microneurosurgery in the central region. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of the pyramidal tract position (PTV) in a neuronavigation system based on ADW provides valid information concerning the position and extension of the principal motor pathways.
METHODS A total of 13 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tracts and the central region underwent microneurosurgery with the help of pyramidal tract visualization (PTV). An ADW sequence obtained preoperatively was fused to an anatomic navigation sequence. The 3-D reconstructions of the precentral gyrus (PG), the pyramidal tract, and the tumor were available in a customized neuronavigation system during surgery. Intraoperatively the PG was identified on the basis of the aforementioned data. Electric motorcortex stimulation (CS) was used to directly verity the PG location and indirectly the fiber tract position.; RESULTS In 11 cases (92%) the prediction of the principal motor pathways' position was correct. In one case of a meningioma, according to PTV, the tumor was falsely localized postcentrally. In the case of a precentral cavernoma, no motor response could be elicited by cortical stimulation.; CONCLUSION Intraoperative PTV on the basis of ADW provides the neurosurgeon with reliable information concerning the position of the principal motor pathways during intracranial procedures as proved with intraoperative electrophysiological testing. The technique has the potential to reduce operative morbidity. PTV is straightforward and can be adapted to other customized neuronavigation devices. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose This work introduces and validates a deep-learning-based fitting method, which can rapidly provide accurate and robust estimation of cytological features of brain tumor based on the IMPULSED (imaging microstructural parameters using limited spectrally edited diffusion) model fitting with diffusion-weighted MRI data. Methods The U-Net was applied to rapidly quantify extracellular diffusion coefficient (D-ex), cell size (d), and intracellular volume fraction (v(in)) of brain tumor. At the training stage, the image-based training data, synthesized by randomizing quantifiable microstructural parameters within specific ranges, was used to train U-Net. At the test stage, the pre-trained U-Net was applied to estimate the microstructural parameters from simulated data and the in vivo data acquired on patients at 3T. The U-Net was compared with conventional non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting in simulations in terms of estimation accuracy and precision. Results Our results confirm that the proposed method yields better fidelity in simulations and is more robust to noise than the NLLS fitting. For in vivo data, the U-Net yields obvious quality improvement in parameter maps, and the estimations of all parameters are in good agreement with the NLLS fitting. Moreover, our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the NLLS fitting (from about 5 min to <1 s). Conclusion The image-based training scheme proposed herein helps to improve the quality of the estimated parameters. Our deep-learning-based fitting method can estimate the cell microstructural parameters fast and accurately.

N2  -  Background and objective Structured reporting of MRI examinations using consensus-based content categories has the potential to improve interdisciplinary communication in neuro-oncology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the essential reporting categories in the imaging of gliomas from a clinical perspective within the setting of a nationwide survey of members of medical societies working in neuro-oncology. Materials and methods An online questionnaire was created based on an interdisciplinary developed catalog of possible MRI reporting elements. Subsequently, specialist members of the German Societies of Neurosurgery, Radiation Oncology, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Neurology, and Neuropathology were invited to evaluate the items with regard to their clinical relevance. Results A total of 171 specialists from Germany participated in the survey (81 neurosurgeons, 66 radiation therapists, and 24 other neuro-oncology experts). Number and anatomic extent of tumors in the contrast-enhanced T1 and 2D T2 sequences (98.8% vs. 97.1%) as well as newly diagnosed lesions at follow-up (T1 + contrast 98.2%; T2 94.7%) were overall most frequently considered crucial. In addition, the experts particularly rated the description of ependymal and/or leptomeningeal tumor dissemination (93.6%) and signs of mass effect including occlusive hydrocephalus and parenchymal mass shifts (> 75.0% each) as essential. Standard mention of intratumoral calcifications, hemorrhages, tumor vascular architecture, or advanced imaging modalities such as MR perfusion, diffusion, tractography, and proton spectroscopy were considered fundamental to their everyday practice by only a minority of neuro-oncology colleagues. Conclusion A referring physician-oriented minimum content standard for MRI examinations in primary brain tumor patients should include as clinically relevant core elements the exact anatomic spread of the lesion(s), including ependymal and meningeal involvement, and the pertinent signs of mass effect.

N2  -  The arcuate fasciculus is a critical component of the neural substrate of human language function. Surgical resection of glioma adjacent to the arcuate fasciculus likely damages this region. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of surgical resection of glioma adjacent to the arcuate fasciculus under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, and we aimed to identify the risk factors for postoperative linguistic deficit. In total, 54 patients with primary glioma adjacent to the arcuate fasciculus were included in this observational study. These patients comprised 38 men and 16 women (aged 43 +/- 11 years). All patients underwent surgical resenction of glioma under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Intraoperative images were updated when necessary for further resection. The gross total resection rate of the 54 patients increased from 38.9% to 70.4% by intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Preoperative language function and glioma-to-arcuate fasciculus distance were associated with poor language outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that glioma-to-arcuate fasciculus distance was the major independent risk factor for poor outcome. The cutoff point of glioma-to-arcuate fasciculus distance for poor outcome was 3.2 mm. These findings suggest that intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging combined with diffusion tensor imaging of the arcuate fasciculus can help optimize tumor resection and result in the least damage to the arcuate fasciculus. Notably, glioma-to-arcuate fasciculus distance is a key independent risk factor for poor postoperative language outcome. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China (approval No. S2014-096-01) on October 11, 2014.

N2  -  Pineal cysts are prevalent in the population. Due to more widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, an increasing number of symptomatic patients with non-hydrocephalic pineal cysts are referred to neurologists and neurosurgeons. Currently, there is no generally accepted theoretical framework for linking symptoms to a pineal cyst. We have previously suggested that cyst-induced crowding of the pineal recess may affect venous runoff from the deep cerebral veins crossing the cyst. However, evidence underpinning this hypothesis is sparse. In the present study, we asked whether crowding of the pineal recess without imaging signs of hydrocephalus may be accompanied with alterations in blood flow of the internal cerebral veins, cerebrospinal fluid flow in the Sylvian aqueduct and cerebrospinal fluid-mediated tracer clearance from the brain along extravascular pathways (referred to as glymphatic function). This prospective, observational study included symptomatic individuals with non-hydrocephalic pineal cysts who underwent a standardized magnetic resonance imaging protocol (n = 25): Eleven patients were treated surgically with craniotomy and cyst extirpation and 14 individuals were managed conservatively without surgery. Our findings suggest that cyst-induced crowding of the pineal recess may have brain-wide effects: (i) There was a significant negative correlation between degree of crowding within the pineal recess and change in maximum venous flow velocity at the cyst, and a significant positive correlation between maximum venous flow velocity change at the cyst and net cerebrospinal fluid flow in the Sylvian aqueduct; (ii) increased degree of crowding in the pineal recess was accompanied by significantly impaired glymphatic enrichment in the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter, indicative of a brain-wide effect in this cohort who also reported markedly impaired subjective sleep quality; (iii) there was a significant negative correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (suggestive of interstitial water content) within the thalamus and glymphatic enrichment of tracer and (iv) pineal recess crowding associated with symptoms. Comparison of the surgical cases [in whom 10/11 (91%) reported marked clinical improvement at follow-up] and the conservatively managed cases [in whom 1/14 (7%) reported marked clinical improvement at follow-up] showed differences in pre-treatment glymphatic tracer enrichment as well as differences in tracer enrichment in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Taken together, we interpret these observations to support the hypothesis that cyst-induced crowding of the pineal recess without hydrocephalus may alter blood flow of the internal cerebral veins and cerebrospinal fluid flow and even cause brain-wide impairment of glymphatic transport with possible implications for cerebrospinal fluid transport of trophic factors such as melatonin.

N2  -  Introduction
Tractography derived from diffusion MRI can provide important insights into human brain microstructure in vivo. Neurosurgeons were quick to adopt the technique at the turn of the century, but it remains plagued by technical fallibilities. This study aims to describe how tractography is deployed clinically in a modern-day, public healthcare system, serving as a snapshot from the 'shop floor' of British neurosurgical practice.; Methods; An 11-question survey was circulated to the mailing lists of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and British Neurosurgical Trainees' Association, including questions on frequency, indication, tracts reconstructed, specific details of techniques used and personnel by whom it was performed, and a free-text section on the limitations of tractography.; Results; 58 survey responses were received, covering all 40 neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland. Overall, responses were received from neurosurgeons at 36 units (90.0%) stating tractography was in use at that unit. 74.1% of the responses were from Consultants. The most common indication for tractography was in tumour resection. It was most commonly performed by neuroradiologists or imaging scientists. 75.9% of respondents stated that the model used to process tractography was the diffusion tensor (DTI). Many respondents were unaware of which algorithm (74.1%) or software tools (65.6%) were used by the operator to produce tractography visualisations. The corticospinal tract was the most commonly reconstructed tract. The most commonly cited limitations of the technique were perceived inaccuracy and brain shift.; Conclusions; In this UK-based survey of practising neurosurgeons, we show that 90% of neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland use tractography regularly; that predominantly DTI-based reconstructions are used; that tumour resection remains the most frequent use of the technique; and that large tracts such as the corticospinal tract are most frequently identified. Many neurosurgeons remain unfamiliar with the underlying methods used to produce tractography visualisations.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subcortical signal intensity abnormalities and lacunar infarcts are the radiologic hallmark of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. MR diffusion studies reveal abnormalities in lesions and also within normal appearing white matter. To further characterize the underlying pathologic abnormality, we evaluated the role of subvoxel free fluid in brain with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy on diffusion parameters and physical disability and analyzed the interrelation between diffusion variables and nonlacunar T2 lesion load.
METHODS: Mean diffusivity maps from fluid-attenuated and standard diffusion images of 13 patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and seven age-matched control participants were compared by means of histogram analysis for three tissue compartments (whole brain parenchyma, normal appearing brain tissue, and nonlacunar lesions) by using a semiautomated region growing algorithm to define whole brain parenchyma and lesions on fluid-attenuated images.; RESULTS: In both patients and control participants, the average mean diffusivity of whole brain parenchyma was lower on fluid-attenuated than on standard images (P < .001). Average mean diffusivity and peak location for all compartments were significantly elevated in patients (P < .001) and higher for lesions than for normal appearing brain tissue on both types of images (P < .001). The difference between standard and fluid-attenuated average mean diffusivity of normal appearing brain tissue, reflecting the subvoxel free fluid content, was elevated in patients (P < .05) and correlated closely with the Rankin score (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.889, P < .001). Average mean diffusivity of whole brain parenchyma and normal appearing brain tissue correlated strongly with the nonlacunar T2 lesion load (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.743-0.928, P < .005).; CONCLUSION: This study shows that standard diffusion measurements are contaminated by free fluid partial volume effects for patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and for control participants. It also provides evidence of a clinical significance of increased subvoxel free fluid in normal appearing brain with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, which may be more important than either global atrophy, increased diffusivity or, T2 lesion load.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEWe report a patient with abnormal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the corticospinal tract caused by mass effect from adjacent enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces.
METHODSDTI was performed using 25 noncollinear directions. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were generated. Region-of-interest measurements of the corticospinal tracts were organized in histograms, and comparisons were made between sides. Statistical analysis consisted of a Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric test and a two-sample test of proportions to compare the relative percentage of voxels >.8.; RESULTSThe patient had no signs or symptoms of motor weakness. The corticospinal tract adjacent to the enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces showed significant changes in the proportion of FA > .8, distribution of FA and distribution of MD (P < .001).; CONCLUSIONSDiffusion tensor changes may be caused by enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms. We hypothesize that the DTI changes are due to alterations in the extravascular extracellular space. Tensor changes should be interpreted with caution in patients with space occupying mass lesions such as brain tumors.

N2  -  Background Evaluate the utility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for the assessment of local recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) on imaging performed 24 h following MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). We hypothesize that microscopic peritumoral infiltration correlates with early subtle variations on DWI images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Methods Of 64 patients with GBM treated with LITT, 39 had MRI scans within 24 h after undergoing LITT. Patterns on DWI images and ADC maps 24 h following LITT were correlated with areas of future GBM recurrence identified through coregistration of subsequent MRI examinations. In the areas of suspected recurrence within the periphery of post-LITT lesions, signal intensity values on ADC maps were recorded and compared with the remaining peritumoral ring. Results Thirty-nine patients with GBM met the inclusion criteria. For predicting recurrent GBM, areas of decreased DWI signal and increased signal on ADC maps within the expected peritumoral ring of restricted diffusion identified 24 h following LITT showed 86.1% sensitivity, 75.2% specificity, and high correlation (r = 0.53) with future areas of GBM recurrence (P < .01). Areas of future recurrence demonstrated a 37% increase in the ADC value (P < .001), compared with findings in the surrounding treated peritumoral region. A significantly greater area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was determined for ADC values (P < .01). Conclusions DWI obtained 24 h following LITT can help predict the location of GBM recurrence months before the development of abnormal enhancement. This may alter future treatment planning, perhaps suggesting areas that may be targeted for additional therapy.

N2  -  Understanding the neural mechanisms that support spontaneous recovery of cognitive abilities can place important constraints on mechanistic theories of brain organization and function, and holds potential to inform clinical interventions. Connectivity-based MRI measures have emerged as a way to study how recovery from brain injury is modulated by changes in intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity. Here we report a detailed and multi-modal case study of a 26 year-old male who presented with a left inferior parietal glioma infiltrating the left arcuate fasciculus. The patient underwent pre- and post-operative functional MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging, as well as behavioral assessments of lauguage, motor, vision and praxis. The surgery for removal of the tumor was carried out with the patient awake, and direct electrical stimulation mapping was used to evaluate cortical language centers. The patient developed a specific difficulty with repeating sentences toward the end of the surgery, after resection of the tumor and partial transection of the arcuate fasciculus. The patient recovered from the sentence repetition impairments over several months after the operation. Coincident with the patient's cognitive recovery, we document a pattern whereby intra-hemispheric functional connectivity was reduced in the left hemisphere, while inter-hemispheric connectivity increased between classic left hemisphere language regions and their right hemisphere homologues. These findings suggest that increased synchrony between the two hemispheres, in the setting of focal transection of the left arcuate fasciculus, can facilitate functional recovery.

N2  -  The "concept of restricted intracellular water diffusion at permeable boundaries," which was recently used to model diffusion-weighted H-1 NMR experiments on glioma cells, was applied to measurements on the rat brain in vivo. Combined with the "concept of extracellular tortuosity," various physiological states of the brain were simulated. Hereby, a variable intracellular volume fraction, intracellular exchange time, and extracellular tortuosity factor were considered for young, adult, and ischemic rat brains. The model simulated the cytotoxic shift of extracellular water, changes in membrane permeability and tissue morphology, and was able to explain the diffusion time dependence as well as the non-monoexponentiality of the diffusion attenuation curves. Preliminary diffusion time dependent experiments on the healthy rat brain (H-1 NMR imaging) agreed well with the theoretical concept. Hereby, the intracellular water signal was separated from extracellular signal contributions by large diffusion weighting. It showed the characteristic of restricted diffusion as well as a signal decay due to the exchange of intracellular water across the plasma membrane. A map of the mean intracellular exchange time for water in living animal brain was determined, and the upper limit in rat brain was evaluated to 15 ms, The presented methods can be applied to correlate local differences in a map of exchange times with tissue morphology and to detect pathological deviations of the exchange time, e,g,, during ischemia, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  -  Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is an extremely rare disease outside East Asia and only ten patients have been described so far Rapid neurologic deterioration, seizures and coma occur after viral illness. We present a 8 month old patient with ANE from Croatia. A female infant developed dramatic neurologic symptoms in the pre-eruption stage of exanthema subitum. On the fourth day of illness, alter which the temperature normalized, tnaculopapular rash of exanthema subitum appeared on the trunk, neck, face and extremities. Elevated titers of imunoglobulin M and imunoglobulin G antibodies to HHV-6 were found. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance images. Apparent diffusion coefficient image revealed a specific tricolor pattern", slightly high signal in the center of the thalamic lesion, low signal in the surrounding thalamus, and high signal in the peripheral white matter The patient was treated with acyclovit; high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in gradual improvement of the symptoms and signs but the patient never attained her premorbid neurologic function. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may lead to better neurologic outcomes. The hallmark of this encephalopathy is multifocal, symmetric brain lesion, which can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging.

N2  -  Changes in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were compared with alterations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and pH in different phases of transient focal cerebral ischemia to study the ADC threshold for breakdown of energy metabolism and tissue acidosis during ischemia and reperfusion. Male Wistar rats underwent 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion without recirculation (n = 3) or with I hour (n = 4) or 10 hours of reperfusion (n=5) inside the magnet, using a remotely controlled thread occlusion model. ADC maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted images and normalized to the preischemic value to obtain relative ADC maps. Hemispheric lesion volume (HLV) was determined on the last relative ADC maps at different relative ADC thresholds and was compared to the HLV measured by ATP depletion and by tissue acidosis. The HLVs, defined by ATP depletion and tissue acidosis, were 26.0% +/- 10.6% and 38.1% +/- 6.5% at the end of ischemia, 3.3% +/- 2.4% and 4.8% +/- 3.5% after 1 hour of reperfusion, and 11.2% +/- 4.7% and 10.9% +/- 5.2% after 10 hours of recirculation, respectively. The relative ADC thresholds for energy failure were consistently approximately 77% of the control value in the three different groups. The threshold for tissue acidosis was higher at the end of ischemia (86% of control) but was similar to the results obtained for ATP depletion after 1 hour (78% of control) and 10 hours (76% of control) of recirculation. These results indicate that the described relative ADC threshold of approximately 77% of control provides a good estimate for the breakdown of energy metabolism not only during middle cerebral artery occlusion but also at the early phase of reperfusion, when recovery of energy metabolism is expected to occur, or some hours later, when development of secondary energy failure was described.

N2  -  Different MRI techniques are used to investigate multiple sclerosis (MS) in vivo. The pathological specificity of these techniques is poorly understood, in particular their relationship to demyelination and axonal loss.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathological substrate of high field MRI in post-mortem (PM) spinal cord (SC) of patients with MS. MRI was performed in PMSCs of four MS patients and a healthy subject on a 7 Tesla machine.; Quantitative MRI maps (PD; T2; T1; magnetization transfer ratio, MTR; diffusion weighted imaging) were obtained. After scanning, the myelin content and the axonal density of the specimens were evaluated neuropathologically using quantitative techniques. Myelin content and axonal density correlated strongly with MTR, T1, PD, and diffusion anisotropy, but only moderately with T2 and weakly with the apparent diffusion coefficient.; Quantitative MR measures provide a promising tool to evaluate components of MS pathology that are clinically meaningful. Further studies are warranted to investigate the potential of new quantitative MR measures to enable a distinction between axonal loss and demyelination and between demyelinated and remyelinated lesions.

N2  -  Aims
To precisely characterize the penumbra by MRI based on a modified photothrombotic stroke mouse model.; Methods; The proximal middle cerebral artery was occluded by a convenient laser system in conjunction with an intravenous injection of Rose Bengal in mice. And the suture MCAO model was performed in seven mice as a comparison of the reproducibility. One hour after occlusion, the penumbra was defined in six random photothrombotic stroke mice by mismatch between perfusion-weighted imaging and the apparent diffusion coefficient map on a home-made workstation. After imaging, three random mice of them were chosen to perform the reperfusion surgery. And the other three mice were sacrificed to stain for several potential penumbra markers, such as c-fos and heart shock protein 90. In the remaining mice, the evolution of the lesions was detected on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. After evaluating the neurological deficit scores, the brains were sectioned and stained by triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Nissl.; Results; The mice subjected to photothrombosis showed significant behavioral deficits. One hour after occlusion, the low perfusion areas on the perfusion-weighted imaging interlaced with the hypointense areas on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, demonstrating that the penumbra was located both surrounding and inside the lesions. This phenomenon was subsequently confirmed by the c-fos and heart shock protein 90 staining. The final T2-weighted images of the mice subjected to the reperfusion surgery were also consistent with the penumbra images at one hour. At early stages, the lesions were clearly identified on the apparent diffusion coefficient map; the volumes of the lesions on the diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging did not reach a maximum until 12 hours. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the final lesions in the photothrombotic stroke mice was 21.7% (0.08 of 0.37) on T2-weighted imaging and 27.8%(0.10 of 0.35) on triphenyltetrazolium chloride, representing a high reproducibility (n = 7). While the CV of the lesions in the MCAO stroke mice was only 70% 0.24 of 0.34, n = 4).; Conclusions; This study has provided a precise imaging definition of the penumbra based on a reproducible photothrombotic stroke mouse model.

N2  -  Here, we investigate radiomics-based characterization of tumor vascular and microenvironmental properties in an orthotopic rat brain tumor model measured using dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Thirty-two immune compromised-RNU rats implanted with human U-251N cancer cells were imaged using DCE-MRI (7Tesla, Dual-Gradient-Echo). The aim was to perform pharmacokinetic analysis using a nested model (NM) selection technique to classify brain regions according to vasculature properties considered as the source of truth. A two-dimensional convolutional-based radiomics analysis was performed on the raw-DCE-MRI of the rat brains to generate dynamic radiomics maps. The raw-DCE-MRI and respective radiomics maps were used to build 28 unsupervised Kohonen self-organizing-maps (K-SOMs). A Silhouette-Coefficient (SC), k-fold Nested-Cross-Validation (k-fold-NCV), and feature engineering analyses were performed on the K-SOMs' feature spaces to quantify the distinction power of radiomics features compared to raw-DCE-MRI for classification of different Nested Models. Results showed that eight radiomics features outperformed respective raw-DCE-MRI in prediction of the three nested models. The average percent difference in SCs between radiomics features and raw-DCE-MRI was: 29.875% & PLUSMN; 12.922%, p < 0.001. This work establishes an important first step toward spatiotemporal characterization of brain regions using radiomics signatures, which is fundamental toward staging of tumors and evaluation of tumor response to different treatments.

N2  -  This study focuses on predicting the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients with focal neurologic symptoms using a combination of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and clinical information. The primary outcome is a poor functional outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3-6 after 3 months of stroke. Employing nnUnet for DWI lesion segmentation, the study utilizes both multi-task and multi-modality methodologies, integrating DWI and clinical data for prognosis prediction. Integrating the two modalities was shown to improve performance by 0.04 compared to using DWI only. The model achieves notable performance metrics, with a dice score of 0.7375 for lesion segmentation and an area under the curve of 0.8080 for mRS prediction. These results surpass existing scoring systems, showing a 0.16 improvement over the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events score. The study further employs grad-class activation maps to identify critical brain regions influencing mRS scores. Analysis of the feature map reveals the efficacy of the multi-tasking nnUnet in predicting poor outcomes, providing insights into the interplay between DWI and clinical data. In conclusion, the integrated approach demonstrates significant advancements in prognosis prediction for cerebral infarction patients, offering a superior alternative to current scoring systems.

N2  -  Simple Summary MR imaging of brain tumors is still mainly based on contrast images and 2 quantitative parameters (relative Cerebral Blood Volume and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient). It is time consuming and suffers from inter-scanner variability. MR Fingerprinting is a new approach that relies on the principle that each tissue examined evolves its own unique signal fingerprint within one single short sequence. It provides quantitative information about the tissue and allows the generation of contrast images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of MR Fingerprinting as a radiogenomic marker to differentiate gliomas according to the genotypic marker isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation. Based on the results of this study MR Fingerprinting seems to have the potential to differentiate IDH-mutant from IDH-wildtype gliomas, which provides a prognostic factor noninvasively. In general MR Fingerprinting leads to a new area of Neuro MRI with the possibility of acquiring quantitative MRI data in a clinically feasible way using only one single short sequence, which may promote molecular precision imaging. (1) Background: Advanced MR imaging (MRI) of brain tumors is mainly based on qualitative contrast images. MR Fingerprinting (MRF) offers a novel approach. The purpose of this study was to use MRF-derived T1 and T2 relaxation maps to differentiate diffuse gliomas according to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation. (2) Methods: Twenty-four patients with histologically verified diffuse gliomas (14 IDH-mutant, four 1p/19q-codeleted, 10 IDH-wildtype) were enrolled. MRF T1 and T2 relaxation times were compared to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) within solid tumor, peritumoral edema, and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), using contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. For perfusion imaging, a T2* weighted perfusion sequence with leakage correction was used. Correlations of MRF T1 and T2 times with two established conventional sequences for T1 and T2 mapping were assessed (a fast double inversion recovery-based MR sequence ('MP2RAGE') for T1 quantification and a multi-contrast spin echo-based sequence for T2 quantification). (3) Results: MRF T1 and T2 relaxation times were significantly higher in the IDH-mutant than in IDH-wildtype gliomas within the solid part of the tumor (p = 0.024 for MRF T1, p = 0.041 for MRF T2). MRF T1 and T2 relaxation times were significantly higher in the IDH-wildtype than in IDH-mutant gliomas within peritumoral edema less than or equal to 1cm adjacent to the tumor (p = 0.038 for MRF T1 mean, p = 0.010 for MRF T2 mean). In the solid part of the tumor, there was a high correlation between MRF and conventionally measured T1 and T2 values (r = 0.913, p < 0.001 for T1, r = 0.775, p < 0.001 for T2), as well as between MRF and ADC values (r = 0.813, p < 0.001 for T2, r = 0.697, p < 0.001 for T1). The correlation was weak between the MRF and rCBV values (r = -0.374, p = 0.005 for T2, r = -0.181, p = 0.181 for T1). (4) Conclusions: MRF enables fast, single-sequence based, multi-parametric, quantitative tissue characterization of diffuse gliomas and may have the potential to differentiate IDH-mutant from IDH-wildtype gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Brain surgery faces important challenges when trying to achieve maximum tumor resection while avoiding postoperative neurological deficits.
OBJECTIVE: For surgeons to have optimal intraoperative information concerning white matter (WM) anatomy, we developed a platform that allows the intraoperative real-time querying of tractography data sets during frameless stereotactic neuronavigation.; METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging were performed on 5 patients before they underwent lesion resection using neuronavigation. During the procedure, the tracked surgical tool tip position was transferred from the navigation system to the 3-dimensional Slicer software package, which used this position to seed the WM tracts around the tool tip location, rendering a geometric visualization of these tracts on the preoperative images previously loaded onto the navigation system. The clinical feasibility of this approach was evaluated in 5 cases of lesion resection. In addition, system performance was evaluated by measuring the latency between surgical tool tracking and visualization of the seeded WM tracts.; RESULTS: Lesion resection was performed successfully in all 5 patients. The seeded WM tracts close to the lesion and other critical structures, as defined by the functional and structural images, were interactively visualized during the intervention to determine their spatial relationships relative to the lesion and critical cortical areas. Latency between tracking and visualization of tracts was less than a second for a fiducial radius size of 4 to 5 mm.; CONCLUSION: Interactive tractography can provide an intuitive way to inspect critical WM tracts in the vicinity of the surgical region, allowing the surgeon to have increased intraoperative WM information to execute the planned surgical resection.

N2  -  Traumatic brain injury (TB!) is a leading cause of death in the young population and long-term disability in relation to pervasive cognitive behavioural disturbances that follow frontal lobe damage. To date, emphasis has been placed primarily on the clinical correlates of frontal cortex damage, whilst identification of the contribution of subjacent white matter lesion is less clear. Our poor understanding of white matter pathology in TBI is primarily due to the low sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging to identify pathological changes in less severe traumatic injury and the lack of methods to localise white matter pathology onto individual frontal lobe connections. In this paper we focus on the potential contribution of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to TBI. Our review of the current literature supports the conclusion that DTI is particularly sensitive to changes in the microstructure of frontal white matter, thus providing a valuable biomarker of the severity of traumatic injury and prognostic indicator of recovery of function. Furthermore we propose an atlas approach to TBI to map white matter lesions onto individual tracts. In the cases presented here we showed a direct correspondence between the clinical manifestations of the patients and the damage to specific white matter tracts. We are confident that in the near future the application of DTI to TBI will improve our understanding of the complex and heterogeneous clinical symptomatology which follows a TB!, especially mild and moderate head injury, which still represents 70-80% of all clinical population.

N2  -  Objectives Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have become an integral part in daily clinical decision making in the last 3 decades. However, there is a broad consensus that GBCAs should be exclusively used if no contrast-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is available to reduce the amount of applied GBCAs in patients. In the current study, we investigate the possibility of predicting contrast enhancement from noncontrast multiparametric brain MRI scans using a deep-learning (DL) architecture. Materials and Methods A Bayesian DL architecture for the prediction of virtual contrast enhancement was developed using 10-channel multiparametric MRI data acquired before GBCA application. The model was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on 116 data sets from glioma patients and healthy subjects by comparing the virtual contrast enhancement maps to the ground truth contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Subjects were split in 3 different groups: enhancing tumors (n = 47), nonenhancing tumors (n = 39), and patients without pathologic changes (n = 30). The tumor regions were segmented for a detailed analysis of subregions. The influence of the different MRI sequences was determined. Results Quantitative results of the virtual contrast enhancement yielded a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 91.2%. T2-weighted imaging, followed by diffusion-weighted imaging, was the most influential sequence for the prediction of virtual contrast enhancement. Analysis of the whole brain showed a mean area under the curve of 0.969 +/- 0.019, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 22.967 +/- 1.162 dB, and a structural similarity index of 0.872 +/- 0.031. Enhancing and nonenhancing tumor subregions performed worse (except for the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the nonenhancing tumors). The qualitative evaluation by 2 raters using a 4-point Likert scale showed good to excellent (3-4) results for 91.5% of the enhancing and 92.3% of the nonenhancing gliomas. However, despite the good scores and ratings, there were visual deviations between the virtual contrast maps and the ground truth, including a more blurry, less nodular-like ring enhancement, few low-contrast false-positive enhancements of nonenhancing gliomas, and a tendency to omit smaller vessels. These "features" were also exploited by 2 trained radiologists when performing a Turing test, allowing them to discriminate between real and virtual contrast-enhanced images in 80% and 90% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions The introduced model for virtual gadolinium enhancement demonstrates a very good quantitative and qualitative performance. Future systematic studies in larger patient collectives with varying neurological disorders need to evaluate if the introduced virtual contrast enhancement might reduce GBCA exposure in clinical practice.

N2  -  Resection control in brain tumor surgery can be achieved in real time with intraoperative MRI (iMRI). Arterial spin labeling (ASL), a technique that measures cerebral blood flow (CBF) non-invasively without the use of intravenous contrast agents, can be performed intraoperatively, providing morpho-physiological information. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, image quality and potential to depict residual tumor of a pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) sequence at 3 T. Seventeen patients with brain tumors, primary (16) or metastatic (1), undergoing resection surgery with iMRI monitoring, were prospectively recruited (nine men, age 56 +/- 16.6 years). A PCASL sequence with long labeling duration (3000 ms) and postlabeling delay (2000 ms) was added to the conventional protocol, which consisted of pre- and postcontrast 3D T1-weighted (T1w) images, optional 3D-FLAIR, and diffusion. Three observers independently assessed the image quality (four-point scale) of PCASL-derived CBF maps. In those with diagnostic quality (Scores 2-4) they evaluated the presence of residual tumor using the conventional sequences first, and the CBF maps afterwards (three-point scale). Inter-observer agreement for image quality and the presence of residual tumor was assessed using Fleiss kappa statistics. The intraoperative CBF ratio of the surgical margins (i.e., perilesional CBF values normalized to contralateral gray matter CBF) was compared with preoperative CBF ratio within the tumor (Wilcoxon's test). Diagnostic ASL image quality was observed in 94.1% of patients (interobserver Fleiss kappa = 0.76). PCASL showed additional foci suggestive of high-grade residual component in three patients, and a hyperperfused area extending outside the enhancing component in one patient. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect in the evaluation of residual tumor with the conventional sequences (Fleiss kappa = 0.92) and substantial for PCASL (Fleiss kappa = 0.80). No significant differences were found between pre and intraoperative CBF ratios (p = 0.578) in patients with residual tumor (n = 7). iMRI-PCASL perfusion is feasible at 3 T and is useful for the intraoperative assessment of residual tumor, providing in some cases additional information to the conventional sequences.

N2  -  To evaluate and compare the performance of synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) in classifying benign and malignant breast lesions and predicting the expression status of immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers. We retrospectively analysed 121 patients with breast lesions who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and SyMRI before surgery in our hospital. DCE-MRI was used to assess the lesions, and then regions of interest (ROIs) were outlined on SyMRI (before and after enhancement), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to obtain quantitative values. After being grouped according to benign and malignant status, the malignant lesions were divided into high and low expression groups according to the expression status of IHC markers. Logistic regression was used to analyse the differences in independent variables between groups. The performance of the modalities in classification and prediction was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In total, 57 of 121 lesions were benign, the other 64 were malignant, and 56 malignant lesions performed immunohistochemical staining. Quantitative values from proton density-weighted imaging prior to an injection of the contrast agent (PD-Pre) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) after the injection (T2-Gd), as well as its standard deviation (SD of T2-Gd), were valuable SyMRI parameters for the classification of benign and malignant breast lesions, but the performance of SyMRI (area under the curve, AUC=0.716) was not as good as that of ADC values (AUC=0.853). However, ADC values could not predict the expression status of breast cancer markers, for which SyMRI had excellent performance. The AUCs of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), p53 and Ki-67 were 0.687, 0.890, 0.852, 0.746, 0.813 and 0.774, respectively. SyMRI had certain value in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions, and ADC values were still the ideal method. However, to predict the expression status of IHC markers, SyMRI had an incomparable value compared with ADC values.

N2  -  The use of biomarkers of microvascular structure and function from perfusion and permeability imaging is now well established in neuro-oncological research. There remain significant challenges to be overcome before these techniques and related biomarkers can find general clinical acceptance. Core to this is the standardization of acquisition and processing protocols for robust use across multiple clinical sites. The potential clinical benefits of these approaches are already becoming clear, particularly in the setting of novel antiangiogenic therapies. With an increasing body of evidence in the scientific literature, and with a steadily falling barrier to entry, the coming decade should see rapid developments in imaging biomarkers, and facilitate their transition into routine clinical practice.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Resection of insula-basal ganglia (IBG) gliomas is challenging because of their deep location and vicinity to critical structures, whereas diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) can noninvasively delineate the tracks of white matter fibers. This study aims to evaluate the role of cortico-spinal tract (CST) positions in prediction of the prognosis of patients with IBG gliomas.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with IBG gliomas. DTT was used to reconstruct the CSTs for all patients, and the IBG gliomas were classified into three types (type I-III) based on the shifted patterns of the CSTs.; RESULTS: The number of patients with type I IBG gliomas was 12 (35.3%), which was equal to the number of patients with type II IBG gliomas, and 10 cases (29.4%) presented with type III IBG gliomas. The six-month KPS score was significantly lower in the type III IBG group than that in the type I group (t=-11.43, P=0.013) and the type II group (t=-9.97, P=0.033). Postoperative MRI demonstrated that gross total or near total resection was achieved in 76.5% (26 cases) of all of the patients.; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the proposed classification of IBG gliomas can be used for predicting the long-term postoperative outcome profiles of IBG glioma patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: By using a neonatal rat hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model, we studied the relationship between lesion volume-measured by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) at an early time point-and irreversible infarct volume. We also evaluated the optimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) threshold that provides the best correlation with irreversible infarct size.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three neonatal rats underwent right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia. MR imaging was performed 1-2 hours post-HI by using DWI and T2WI and at day 4 post-HI by using T2WI. Lesion volumes relative to whole brain (%LV) were measured on ADC maps by using different relative ADC thresholds 60%-80% of mean contralateral ADC and T2WI. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to study the relationships between In(%LV) at MR imaging and %LV at histopathology.; RESULTS: At 1-2 hours post-H I, all lesion volume measurements on DWI were significantly correlated with the infarct volume on histopathology, with the best correlation attained at the 80% ADC threshold (r = 0.738; P <.001). The estimated regression formula was %LV on histopathology = 20.60 + 3.33 In(% LV on 80% ADC threshold) (adjusted R-2 = 0.523; P <.001). Lesion volume at 1-2 hours post-H I tended to underestimate the final infarct volume.; CONCLUSION: Early post-HI MR imaging by using DWI correlates moderately well with the size of irreversible infarct, especially when measured by using a relative ADC threshold of 80% mean contralateral ADC.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Topographic patterns of brain injury in neonates can help with differentiation and prognostic categorization of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In this study, we quantitatively and objectively characterized the location of hypoxic ischemic lesions in term neonates with varying severity of HIE. Methods We analyzed term neonates (born >= 37 postmenstrual gestational weeks) with MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diagnoses of HIE. Neonates' HIE was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe. The hypoxic ischemic lesions were segmented on DWI series with attention to T1- and T2-weighted images and then co-registered onto standard brain space to generate summation maps for each severity category. Applying voxel-wise general linear models, we also identified cerebral regions more likely to infarct with increasing severity of HIE, after correction for lesion volume and time-to-scan as covariates. Results We included 33 neonates: 20 with mild, eight with moderate, and five with severe HIE. Infarct volumes (p = .00052) and Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration scores at 1 minute (p = .032) differed between HIE severity categories. Hypoxic ischemic lesions in neonates with mild and moderate HIE were predominant in subcortical and deep white matter along the border zones of arterial supply territories, while severe HIE also involved basal ganglia, hippocampus, and thalamus. In voxel-wise analysis, higher severity of HIE was associated with the presence of lesions in hippocampus, thalamus, and lentiform nucleus. Conclusions In term neonates, mild/moderate HIE is associated with infarctions of arterial territory watershed zones, whereas severe HIE distinctively involves basal ganglia, thalami, and hippocampi.

N2  -  The ventricular migration of vitreous silicone oil (SiO) is rare and can easily be mistaken for intraventricular hemorrhage or a ruptured colloid cyst. We report here the case of an adult male who was misdiagnosed with a ruptured colloid cyst and was subsequently found to have ventricular migration of vitreous SiO. A 57-yearold male presented unresponsive following a respiratory arrest and underwent a head computed tomography (CT) scan that demonstrated multiple ovoid hyperdensities in the ventricular system, which was concerning for a ruptured colloid cyst. He was transferred to our institution for neurosurgical evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and demonstrated widespread abnormal diffusion restriction throughout the cortex and basal ganglia, consistent with anoxic brain injury secondary to hypoxic respiratory arrest. The MRI also demonstrated an abnormal signal in areas corresponding with the previously identified intraventricular lesions, which did not layer posteriorly. Given that the MRI sequence signals of the lesions in the ventricular system matched perfectly with the signals of the somewhat deflated SiO within the globe, these multiple ovoid lesions on imaging were most consistent with the migration of SiO from the vitreous body of the right globe into the ventricular system. This case demonstrates a diagnostic error that can occur in emergent settings because of the broad differential diagnosis for cerebral ventricular hyperdensities. A ruptured colloid cyst was considered the reason for transfer, with the anticipation of neurosurgical intervention, but further imaging demonstrated that this was an incidental finding in this patient who presented in extremis. Awareness of this rare clinical condition can prevent overutilization of resources and unnecessary interventions.

N2  -  Background: Two statistical models have been established to evaluate characteristics associated with postoperative motor outcome in patients with glioma associated to the motor cortex (M1) or the corticospinal tract (CST). One model is based on a clinicoradiological prognostic sum score (PrS) while the other one relies on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) tractography. The objective was to compare the models regarding their prognostic value for postoperative motor outcome and extent of resection (EOR) with the aim of developing a combined, improved model. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive prospective cohort of patients who underwent resection for motor associated glioma between 2008 and 2020, and received a preoperative nTMS motor mapping with nTMSbased diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The primary outcomes were the EOR and the motor outcome (on the day of discharge and 3 months postoperatively according to the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) grading). For the nTMS model, the infiltration of M1, tumor-tract distance (TTD), resting motor threshold (RMT) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assesed. For the PrS score (ranging from 1 to 8, lower scores indicating a higher risk), we assessed tumor margins, volume, presence of cysts, contrast agent enhancement, MRI index (grading white matter infiltration), preoperative seizures or sensorimotor deficits. Results: Two hundred and three patients with a median age of 50 years (range: 20-81 years) were analyzed of whom 145 patients (71.4%) received a GTR. The rate of transient new motor deficits was 24.1% and of permanent new motor deficits 18.8%. The nTMS model demonstrated a good discrimination ability for the shortterm motor outcome at day 7 of discharge (AUC = 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.72-0.86) and the long-term motor outcome after 3 months (AUC = 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.71-0.87). The PrS score was not capable to predict the postoperative motor outcome in this cohort but was moderately associated with the EOR (AUC = 0.64; CI 0.55-0.72). An improved, combined model was calculated to predict the EOR more accurately (AUC = 0.74, 95 %CI: 0.65-0.83). Conclusion: The nTMS model was superior to the clinicoradiological PrS model for potentially predicting the motor outcome. A combined, improved model was calculated to estimate the EOR. Thus, patient counseling and surgical planning in patients with motor-associated tumors should be performed using functional nTMS data combined with tractography.

N2  -  The reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water shortly after a focal ischemic insult is thought to reflect intracellular water accumulation (cytotoxic edema) related to high-energy metabolism failure and loss of ion homeostasis. We attempted to clarify whether varying ranges of ADC measurements in ischemic brain tissue can be used to differentiate between reversible and irreversible ischemic lesions before reperfusion in a temporary ischemia model. We induced 45 minutes of temporary ischemia in 12 rats using the middle cerebral artery suture occlusion method. Regional changes of ADC values were serially measured in seven regions of interest in each hemisphere and evaluated by Delta ADC, defined as the difference between ADC value in an ischemic region and that in a contralateral homologous region. We acquired dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion images 2 minutes before and after reperfusion to document reduced perfusion and its restoration. We confirmed the infarct area by 2,3,5-triphenyltetra-zolium chloride staining 24 hours after occlusion and correlated this with the MRI studies. Recovery of initially reduced ADC values occurred only in ischemic regions where Delta ADC values were not below -0.25 X 10(-5) cm(2)/sec. Although the extent of infarction at postmortem examination varied in regions with moderately decreased prereperfusion ADC values, more than 70% of regions of interest with slight declines of prereperfusion ADC values exhibited no infarction. ADC values progressively decreased after reperfusion in regions that initially had severely decreased prereperfusion ADC values, and postmortem examination always demonstrated infarction in such regions. These results suggest that measurement of Delta ADC can provide information that will enable the clinician to discriminate between irreversible and potentially reversible ischemic regions before reperfusion is performed.

N2  -  Objectives: We sought to evaluate the accuracy of the perfusion computed tomography (PCT) deconvolution-based brain perfusion measurements and the lesions' (infarct and penumbra) volumetric with regard to arterial input function (AIF) selection in patients with acute stroke.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients with symptoms of acute stroke underwent PCT at admission. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all patients after 3.6 +- 1.7 days (range, 1.5-6 days). PCT maps were generated focusing on the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ipsilateral and contralateral to the ischemic lesion as AIFs. Infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were delineated on cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated in the ischemic regions as provided by the 3 different AH's, the normality test was applied for the obtained parameters, and the values were correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Volumes of the ischemic regions (as obtained by the different AIFs) also were correlated and compared (paired t test) to the follow-up infarct volume.; Results: The CBF and CBV values obtained by the different All's in the infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were significantly correlated (r = 0.94-0.96, P <= 0.01). Only in the infarct region calculated MTT values were correlated (r = 0.88-0.91, P < 0.05) between the different All's groups. High correlation coefficients (r = 0.79-0.91, P < 0.001) were observed between the admission PCT infarct and total ischemic volume and the MRI follow-up infarct volume. ACA as AIF provided the best correlations (r = 0.91, P = 0.0002) with the follow-up measurements. No statistically significant difference was found between the 3 different AIF-estimated admission total ischemic volumes and the follow-up infarct volume.; Conclusions: The AIF selection in the ACA as well as in the ipsilateral (to the hypoperfused area) or contralateral branches of the MCA has no statistically significant impact on the calculation of the CBF, CBV values, and the volume estimation of the ischemic region in the acute stroke patients.

N2  -  Objective: Preoperative non-invasive mapping of motor function with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has become a widely used diagnostic procedure. Determination of the patient-individual resting motor threshold (rMT) is of great importance to achieve reliable results when conducting nTMS motor mapping. Factors which contribute to differences in rMT of brain tumor patients have not been fully investigated.Methods: We included adult patients with all types of de novo and recurrent intracranial lesions, suspicious for intra-axial brain tumors. The outcome measure was the rMT of the upper extremity, defined as the stimulation intensity eliciting motor evoked potentials with amplitudes greater than 50 mu V in 50 % of applied stimulations.Results: Eighty nTMS examinations in 75 patients (37.5 % female) aged 57.9 +/- 14.9 years were evaluated. In non-parametric testing, rMT values were higher in patients with upper extremity paresis (p = 0.024) and lower in patients with high grade gliomas (HGG) (p = 0.001). rMT inversely correlated with patient age (r(s)=-0.28, p = 0.013) and edema volume (r(s)=-0.28, p = 0.012) In regression analysis, infiltration of the precentral gyrus (p<0.001) increased rMT values. Values of rMT were reduced in high grade gliomas (p<0.001), in patients taking Levetiracetam (p = 0.019) and if perilesional edema infiltrated motor eloquent brain (p<0.001). Subgroup analyses of glioma patients revealed similar results. Values of rMT did not differ between hand and forearm muscles.Conclusion: Most factors confounding rMT in our study were specific to the lesion. These factors contributed to the variability in cortical excitability and must be considered in clinical work with nTMS to achieve reliable results with nTMS motor mapping.

N2  -  It has been a clinically important, long-standing challenge to accurately localize epileptogenic focus in drug-resistant focal epilepsy because more intensive intervention to the detected focus, including resection neurosurgery, can provide significant seizure reduction. In addition to neurophysiological examinations, neuroimaging plays a crucial role in the detection of focus by providing morphological and neuroanatomical information. On the other hand, epileptogenic lesions in the brain may sometimes show only subtle or even invisible abnormalities on conventional MRI sequences, and thus, efforts have been made for better visualization and improved detection of the focus lesions. Recent advance in neuroimaging has been attracting attention because of the potentials to better visualize the epileptogenic lesions as well as provide novel information about the pathophysiology of epilepsy. While the progress of newer neuroimaging techniques, including the non-Gaussian diffusion model and arterial spin labeling, could non-invasively detect decreased neurite parameters or hypoperfusion within the focus lesions, advances in analytic technology may also provide usefulness for both focus detection and understanding of epilepsy. There has been an increasing number of clinical and experimental applications of machine learning and network analysis in the field of epilepsy. This review article will shed light on recent advances in neuroimaging for focal epilepsy, including both technical progress of images and newer analytical methodologies and discuss about the potential usefulness in clinical practice.

N2  -  Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis common in males over 50 years of age that causes various organ symptoms. In recent years, it has become important to distinguish deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) from childhood-onset PAN.A 13-year-old girl was urgently transferred to our hospital with sudden weakness in her right upper and lower limbs. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 8. Plain MRI of the brain indicated high-signal areas in the right caudate nucleus, internal capsule, and left basal ganglia when applying T2 -weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); and low signals in the same regions in an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. It demonstrated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system or multiple cerebral infarctions attributable to vasculitis, and it is difficult to differentiate between them based on image findings alone, and cannot be determined without following the clinical course. Hence, we treated with steroid therapy, which is effective for both conditions. Although the paralysis was alleviated, an MRI of the brain reperformed on day 7 revealed expansion of the lesion with contrast enhancement in the feeding area of the left lateral striatal artery, a high signal in DWI, and a low signal in an ADC map. Based on the clinical and radiological findings, we diagnosed a cerebral infarction attributable to vasculitis. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of her chest and abdominal CT angiography revealed that she met the diagnostic criteria for PAN, and adenosine deaminase 2 (AD2) activity level was low. The patient was treated with steroids combined with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide but three weeks after discharge developed a new cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia. We commenced infliximab; no recurrence of cerebral infarction has been noted.The low AD2 activity may explain the intractable atypical course of this case. Further studies are needed to reveal the role of AD2 in patients with residual enzyme activity and reevaluation of the PAN diagnostic criteria is essential.

N2  -  The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) plays an important role in diagnosing intracranial tumors and predicting the histopathological grade of the tumor. However, the differences in the ADC values between craniopharyngiomas and germ cell tumors (GCTs) have not been clarified. We therefore evaluated the DWI and ADC values at b = 1000 and b = 4000 s/mm(2) on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and assessed the possibility of differentiating between craniopharyngiomas and GCTs. We retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with craniopharyngioma and 24 patients with GCT who underwent surgery and received a histopathological diagnosis. Thirty-four patients underwent DWI with b = 1000 and b = 4000 s/mm(2) and nine patients underwent periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) DWI with b = 1000 s/mm(2). The ADC was determined by manually placing regions of interests (ROIs) in the respective tumor regions on the ADC maps and is expressed as the minimum (ADC(MIN)), mean (ADC(MEAN)), and maximum (ADC(MAX)) absolute values. The craniopharyngiomas showed lower intensity on DWI at b = 1000 and b = 4000 s/mm(2) than the GCTs. Furthermore, the craniopharyngiomas demonstrated significantly high ADC values (ADC(MIN), ADC(MEAN), and ADC(MAX)) in comparison with the GCTs on DWI at b = 1000 and b = 4000 s/mm(2). The logistic discriminant analysis clarified the advantage of ADC(MIN) at b = 4000 s/mm(2) in differentiating between craniopharyngiomas and GCTs compared with the other ADC values. DWI and the ADC values may help clinicians to differentiate between craniopharyngiomas and GCTs. The ADC(MIN) at b = 4000 s/mm(2) is particularly useful for differentiation.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is a powerful new technology that is enabling development of noninvasive applications for complex brain disorders. This is currently revolutionizing the treatment of tremor disorders, and a variety of experimental applications are under active investigation. To fully realize the potential of this disruptive technology, many challenges have been identified, some of which have been addressed and others remain to be solved. As an image-based technology, optimal intraoperative imaging can be difficult to achieve and several factors can influence the quality of these images. Technical issues with current devices can also limit the effective delivery of ultrasound technology to particular targets. While lesioning is the primary approved application of magnetic resonance- guided focused ultrasound at present, the ability to transient and precisely open the blood-brain barrier has the potential to clear brain pathologies and deliver restorative therapies, but this more experimental method presents unique difficulties to overcome. Finally, regulatory and reimbursement hurdles currently remain complex and continue to limit widespread application of even approved, effective applications. Here we review many of these challenges, discuss several solutions that have already been developed, and propose potential options for addressing some of these complexities in the future.

N2  -  BACKGROUND Cross-sectional associations have been found between frail individuals and worse white matter (WM) integrity. However, the prospective association between WM integrity and frailty is still unclear. Our objectives were to measure associations between WM integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the 5-year worsening of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). SETTING Thirteen memory centers in France and Monaco between 2008 and 2011. PARTICIPANTS Participants (mean age = 74.7 +/- 3.9 years) with no dementia at baseline who had functional magnetic resonance imaging performed as part of the MAPT study (n = 227). MEASUREMENTS Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were acquired for 10 different brain regions. Frailty was assessed by the Fried frailty phenotype (score from 0 to 5, higher is worse) at up to seven time points for 5 years. Mixed effect ordinal logistic regression model was used to assess the prospective association between DTI parameters (independent variables) and frailty (dependent variable). All the analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline total intracranial volume, and the presence of one of the following cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and/or hypercholesterolemia). RESULTS A statistically significant association was found between the RD, AxD, and MD for different brain regions (anterior limb of internal capsule, external capsule, posterior corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, superior frontal occipital fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus) and worsening of frailty over 5 years after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to show that WM integrity is associated with frailty in older adults. The mechanisms related to these results require further investigation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Several intracranial pathologies present as a ring-enhancing lesion on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), creating diagnostic difficulty. We studied the characteristics of the anatomical border of gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted imaging (WI) and hypointensity on T2WI to employ a simple technique of histogram-profile analysis of MRI for differentiation of various ring-enhancing intracranial lesions.
METHODS: After approval from the institutional review board, preoperative MRI (T2WI, postcontrast T1WI) scans were analyzed retrospectively in 18 patients with histologically confirmed brain abscess, 66 glioblastomas, 46 brain-metastases, and 16 tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS). T2WI and postcontrast T1WI were overlapped, and histogram-profile analysis was performed with in-house image-fusion software. The pattern of differential-peaks in histogram-profile was assessed visually. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis incorporating histogram-profile patterns was performed in patients with glioblastoma.; RESULTS: The histogram-profile study revealed 4 distinct patterns. Pattern 1 showed no differential T2-hypointensity trough, pattern 2 had T2-hypointensity trough inside, whereas pattern 3 had T2-hypointensity trough overlapping the enhanced margin. Pattern 4 had T2-hypointensity trough immediately external to the enhanced margin. Pattern 1 was specific for tumefactive MS (93.3%), whereas pattern 4 was specific for glioblastoma (40.7%). Pattern 4 glioblastoma was subdivided into rim (T2-hypointensity .50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor) and arc (T2-hypointensity <50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor). Pattern 4 glioblastoma was further subdivided into group A (edema: T2-hyperintensity 513 degrees0 of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor) and group B (less edema: T2-hyperintensity <50% of circumference of contrast-enhanced tumor). Patients with pattern 3 glioblastoma (37.6%) had better survival compared with others (P = 0.0341) and pattern 4B had decreased survival compared with pattern 4A (P = 0.0001) and others (P = 0.0003).; CONCLUSIONS: Tumefactive MS and a subset of glioblastomas show specific patterns in histogram-profile analysis. The difference in anatomical border also determines difference in survival in glioblastoma. Histogram-profile analysis is a simple and efficient technique to differentiate these pathologies.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging estimates of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have shown sensitivity to brain tumor cellularity as well as response to therapy. Functional diffusion maps (fDMs) exploit these principles by examining voxelwise changes in ADC within the same patient over time. Currently, the fDM technique involves linear image registration of ADC maps from subsequent follow-up times to pretreatment ADC maps; however, misregistration of ADC maps due to geometric distortions as well as mass effect from growing tumor can confound fDM measurements. In this study, we compare the use of a nonlinear registration scheme to the current linear fDM technique in 70 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme treated with bevacizumab. Results suggest that nonlinear registration of pretreatment ADC maps to post-treatment ADC maps improves the clinical predictability, sensitivity, and specificity of fDMs for both progression-free and overall survival.

N2  -  Tc-99m-ECD SPECT is valuable for the evaluation of cell viability and function. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the significance of Tc-99m-ECD brain SPECT in ischemic stroke. We compared Tc-99m-ECD brain SPECT with perfusion and diffusion weighted images (PWI, DWI). Ten patients with acute and early subacute ischemic stroke were included in this prospective study. T2-weighted images (T2WI), DWI, PWI and Tc-99m-ECD SPECT were obtained during both the acute/early subacute and late subacute stages. In the case of PWI, time to peak (TTP) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were obtained. The rCBV map and Tc-99m-ECD SPECT images were compared in 8 lesions using DeltaAI. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated as (Ci - Cc) X 200 / (Ci + Cc); where Ci is the mean number of pixel counts of an ipsilateral lesion and Cc is the mean number of pixel counts of the normal contralateral hemisphere. DeltaAI was defined as Al-acute - Al-subacute in the ischemic core and periphery. PWI and Tc-99m-ECD SPECT detected new lesions of the hyperacute stage or of evolving stroke more accurately than T2WI and DWI. Tc-99m-ECD SPECT was able to localize the infarct core and peri-infarct ischemia in all lesions in both the acute and the subacute stages. DeltaAI was higher in the rCBV map than in the Tc-99m-ECD SPECT images in the ischemic core (p = 0.063) and in the periphery (p = 0.091). In the Tc-99m-ECD SPECT images, DeltaAI was higher in the ischemic core than in the periphery (p = 0.028). During the subacute stage, Tc-99m-ECD SPECT detected all the lesions without the pseudonormalization seen in the MR images of 5/11 lesions. Based on this study, Tc-99m-ECD SPECT is comparable to PWI in terms of its ability to detect acute stroke and is more useful than PWI in the case of subacute infarction.

N2  -  Background. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) allows for assessment of diffusion influenced by microcellular structures. We analyzed DKI in suspected low-grade gliomas prior to histopathological diagnosis. The aim was to investigate if diffusion parameters in the perilesional normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) differed from contralesional white matter, and to investigate differences between glioma malignancy grades II and III and glioma subtypes (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas).
Patients and methods. Forty-eight patients with suspected low-grade glioma were prospectively recruited to this institutional review board-approved study and investigated with preoperative DKI at 3T after written informed consent. Patients with histologically proven glioma grades II or III were further analyzed (n=35). Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on T2FLAIR images and co-registered to diffusion MRI parameter maps. Mean DKI data were compared between perilesional and contralesional NAWM (student's t-test for dependent samples, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Histogram DKI data were compared between glioma types and glioma grades (multiple comparisons of mean ranks for all groups). The discriminating potential for DKI in assessing glioma type and grade was assessed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.; Results. There were significant differences in all mean DKI variables between perilesional and contralesional NAWM (p=< 0.000), except for axial kurtosis (p=0.099). Forty-four histogram variables differed significantly between glioma grades II (n=23) and III (n=12) (p=0.003-0.048) and 10 variables differed significantly between ACs (n=18) and ODs (n=17) (p=0.011-0.050). ROC curves of the best discriminating variables had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.657-0.815.; Conclusions. Mean DKI variables in perilesional NAWM differ significantly from contralesional NAWM, suggesting altered microstructure by tumor infiltration not depicted on morphological MRI. Histogram analysis of DKI data identifies differences between glioma grades and subtypes.

N2  -  Objective To investigate the rule of the aquaporin-4 ( AQP4) expression in acute ischemic brain edema, and to study the correlation between AQP4 expression and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
Methods Thirty-six Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups randomly, control group (n = 12) and operation group ( n = 24) in which right middle cerebral artery of each animal had been occluded unilaterally (MCAO) at interval times of: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours, respectively. The operation process of the control group was the same as the operation group except for the MCAO. All groups were examined using DWI. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), relative density (rd) and relative area (rs) of the biggest hyperintensity signal layer on DWI were measured. After that the animals were sacrificed and perfused with the mixture solution consisting of TTC. The biggest layers of the ischemic cerebral tissues in each rat corresponding to the DWI were stained with TTC and examined with immunochemistry (AS), in situ hybridization (a) and histology.; Results There was no significant change in the control group. In the operation group, a hyperintensity signal was found in the DWI of the right MAC territory at 15 minutes after MCAO. The ADC value decreased quickly within one hour after MCAO, while the AQP4 expression, rd-DWI and rs-DWI increased rapidly during this stage. As time progressed, the ADC value decreased further to (2.1 +- 0.6) x 10(4) mm(2)s at 3 hours, and then began to increase slowly till 24 hours. But the AQP4 expression ( AS and a) and rd as well as the rs continuously increased slowly between 1 hour and 6 hours after MCAO, followed a peak after 6 hours. The AQP4 expression (a) showed a positive relationship with the rs-DWI, they all presented two peaks and a plateau. The corresponding sequential pathologic changes were a gradual increase of intracellular edema (within one hour), then an emergence of vasogenic edema (1-6 hours), and final necrosis and liquefaction (6-24 hours).; Conclusions Upregulated expression of AQP4 may play a significant role in acute ischemic brain edema, especially during the stages of intracellular edema and necrosis, but it has no correlation to vasogenic edema. Certainly, the high expression of AQP4 is perhaps one of the most important reasons of the decrease of ADC and hyperintensity on the DWI in the intracellular edema.

N2  -  Background: Distortion-free, high-resolution diffusion imaging using DIADEM (Distortion-free Imaging: A Double Encoding Method), proposed recently, has great potential for clinical applications. However, it can suffer from prolonged scan times and its reliability for quantitative diffusion imaging has not been evaluated.
Purpose: To investigate the clinical feasibility of DIADEM-based high-resolution diffusion imaging on a novel compact 3T (C3T) by evaluating the reliability of quantitative diffusion measurements and utilizing both the high-performance gradients (80 mTm, 700 Tms) and the sequence optimization with the navigator acquisition window reduction and simultaneous multislice (multiband) imaging.; Study Type: Prospective feasibility study.; PhantomSubjects: Diffusion quality control phantom scans to evaluate the reliability of quantitative diffusion measurements; 36 normal control scans for B-0-field mapping; six healthy and two patient subject scans with a brain tumor for comparisons of diffusion and anatomical imaging.; Field StrengthSequence: 3T; the standard single-shot echo-planar-imaging (EPI), multishot DIADEM diffusion, and anatomical (2D-FSE fast-spin-echo, 2D-FLAIR fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery, and 3D-MPRAGE magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo) imaging.; Assessment: The scan time reduction, the reliability of quantitative diffusion measurements, and the clinical efficacy for high-resolution diffusion imaging in healthy control and brain tumor volunteers.; Statistical Test: Bland-Altman analysis.; Results: The scan time for high in-plane (0.86 mm(2)) resolution, distortion-free, and whole brain diffusion imaging were reduced from 10 to 5 minutes with the sequence optimizations. All of the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in phantom were within the 95% confidence interval in the Bland-Altman plot. The proposed acquisition with a total off-resonance coverage of 597.2 Hz wider than the expected bandwidth of 500 Hz in human brain could yield a distortion-free image without foldover artifacts. Compared with EPI, therefore, this approach allowed direct image matching with the anatomical images and enabled improved delineation of the tumor boundaries.; Data Conclusion: The proposed high-resolution diffusion imaging approach is clinically feasible on C3T due to a combination of hardware and sequence improvements.

N2  -  This work is motivated by a quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging study of the relative change in tumor vascular permeability during the course of radiation therapy. The differences in tumor and healthy brain tissue physiology and pathology constitute a notable feature of the image data-spatial heterogeneity with respect to its contrast uptake profile (a surrogate for permeability) and radiation induced changes in this profile. To account for these spatial aspects of the data, we employ a Gaussian hidden Markov random field (MRF) model. The model incorporates a latent set of discrete labels from the MRF governed by a spatial regularization parameter. We estimate the MRF regularization parameter and treat the number of MRF states as a random variable and estimate it via a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conduct simulation studies to examine the performance of the model and compare it with a recently proposed method using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Simulation results show that the Bayesian algorithm performs as well, if not slightly better than the EM based algorithm. Results on real data suggest that the tumor "core" vascular permeability increases relative to healthy tissue three weeks after starting radiotherapy, which may be an opportune time to initiate chemotherapy and warrants further investigation.

N2  -  The autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method was exployed to map the distribution of changes in local cerebral glucose utilization following unilateral and bilateral electrolytic lesions of the lateral habenula nucleus. Local cerebral glucose utilization was measured 1 wk after the placement of the lesions. Unilateral lesions of the nucleus had no effect on the rates of glucose utilization in the 79 brain structures examined. Bilateral lesions produced selective reductions in glucose  utilization in several structures compared to the results in sham-operated animals. Reductions were found in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei and the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei which receive projecting fibers mainly from the medial part of the lateral habenula nucleus. The rates of glucose metabolism in the interpeduncular nucleus and mamillary body were also reduced by the bilateral habenular lesions. No anatomic structures rostral to the lsions were metabolically affected.

N2  -  To evaluate the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on intracranial metastases with diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient maps. A total of 107 patients with 144 metastases larger than 1 cm in diameter were retrospectively reviewed. We calculated the DWITumor/white matter ratios (DWIT/WM ratio) between the metastases and the normal, contralateral frontal white matter at each time point. We also recorded the ADC values for metastases (ADC(T) values). The DWIT/WM ratio and ADC(T) values were assessed for correlation with the patients' tumor response, brain edema, and survival. A decrease in DWIT/WM ratios was seen in the controlled metastases, and an increase in the DWIT/WM ratio were seen in the metastases with poor tumor control. On the other hand, an increase in ADC(T) values was seen in the controlled metastases, and a decrease in ADC(T) values was seen in the metastases with poor control. The differences were significant (p value: 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Sensitivity of a decrease in the DWIT/WM ratio to make an early prediction of tumor control was 83.9 %, and specificity was 88.5 %. When using the initial ADC(T) values of metastases to predict tumor response, sensitivity and specificity were 85.5 and 72.7 %, respectively. DWI/ADC is a practical method for studying the efficacy of SRS and predicting early metastases response progression. A decrease signal on DWI and increased ADC values are indicators of good tumor control, and reflect the beneficial effect of SRS.

N2  -  The imaging of the distribution of thermal conductivity tensor at various points in a tissue is an essential need when accurate knowledge of heat energy flow in tissue is required for diagnostic and therapeutic management in oncology, neurology, and interventional radiology. Conventionally, tissue thermal conductivity is assumed as scalar, which induces errors in obtaining proper heat flow distribution. Using statistical thermodynamics principles, we present a method for constructing thermal conductivity tensor image of a tissue or an organ, using an MRI scanner. We elucidate the necessary tensorial cross-property relationship between different transport processes and confirm the same by experimental data. Using the proposed method, we perform a preliminary study of the procedure of thermal conductivity tensor imaging of the human brain as a case study. The methodology is quantitatively elucidated by measurement of tissue anisotropy distribution, tensor eigenvalues, and path tracking, along with three illustrative examples showing that transport properties estimated by the proposed thermal conductivity approach closely corroborates, with over 90% accuracy, to the experimentally measured values of the transport parameters which have been independently experimentally measured directly. By combining diffusion and perfusion tensor imaging approaches using mobility-encoding and spin-labelling methodologies respectively, we delineate the possible applications of this novel imaging modality to clinical problems of energy flow mapping involving biological heat transfer equations, such as planning of hyperthermic treatment to brain tumors, and electrode localization for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

N2  -  BACKGROUND
In this article, we present two can't-miss findings on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 3.0-T MR system resulting in a better surgical option in prolactinoma treatment after emergent of dopamine agonists.; METHODS; We reviewed six cases of pituitary prolactinoma; each had vague or occult bulk of adenoma on 1.5-T MR imaging, which were finally confirmed by surgery. Four cases were preoperatively examined with a 3.0-T MR imaging system. With the 3.0-T MR system, 3-dimension-anisotropy-contrast (3DAC) MR imaging and 3-dimension fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (3D-FSPGR) imaging were used for depiction of the adenoma.; RESULTS; 3DAC imaging revealed cavernous sinus (CS) pathology in three cases, and multiplanar reconstruction of 3D-FSPGR imaging revealed normal pituitary gland and invasive adenoma into the CS in three cases and creeping extension up to the contralateral side of the CS invasion in four cases.; CONCLUSIONS; Two can't-miss findings: (1) intrasellar creeping extension up to the opposite side of the adenoma main body and (2) intracavernous-localized adenoma with indistinct intrasellar mass should be carefully considered when neurosurgeons perform adenomectomy for patients with prolactinoma, even in cases of microprolactinoma.

N2  -  Objective
Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is an MRI technique with potential applications in measuring brain tumor perfusion, but its clinical impact remains to be determined. We assessed the usefulness of IVIM-metrics in predicting survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.; Methods; Fifteen patients with glioblastoma underwent MRI including spin-echo echo-planar DWI using 13 b-values ranging from 0 to 1000 smm(2). Parametric maps for diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were generated for contrast-enhancing regions (CER) and non-enhancing regions (NCER). Regions of interest were manually drawn in regions of maximum f and on the corresponding dynamic susceptibility contrast images. Prognostic factors were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses.; Results; We found that f(CER) and D*(CER) correlated with rCBF(CER). The best cutoffs for 6-month survival were f(CER)>9.86% and D*(CER)>21.712 x 10(-3)mm(2)s (100% sensitivity, 71.4% specificity, 100% and 80% positive predictive values, and 80% and 100% negative predictive values; AUC: 0.893 and 0.857, respectively). Treatment yielded the highest hazard ratio (5.484; 95% CI: 1.162-25.88; AUC: 0.723; P = 0.031); f(CER) combined with treatment predicted survival with 100% accuracy.; Conclusions; The IVIM-metrics f(CER) and D*(CER) are promising biomarkers of 6-month survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

N2  -  In this study, the potential of semiquantitative and quantitative analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was investigated to differentiate glioblastoma (GB) from radiation necrosis (RN) in rats.
F98 GB growth was seen on MRI 8-23 days post-inoculation (n = 15). RN lesions developed 6-8 months post-irradiation (n = 10). DCE-MRI was acquired using a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence. Regions of interest (ROIs) encompassed peripheral contrast enhancement in GB (n = 15) and RN (n = 10) as well as central necrosis within these lesions (GB (n = 4), RN (n = 3)). Dynamic contrast-enhanced time series, obtained from the DCE-MRI data, were fitted to determine four function variables (amplitude A, offset from zero C, wash-in rate k, and wash-out rate D) as well as maximal intensity (Imax(F)) and time to peak (TTPF). Secondly, maps of semiquantitative and quantitative parameters (extended Tofts model) were created using Olea Sphere ((O)). Semiquantitative DCE-MRI parameters included wash-in(O), wash-out(O), area under the curve (AUC(O)), maximal intensity (Imax(O)), and time to peak (TTPO). Quantitative parameters included the rate constant plasma to extravascular-extracellular space (EES) (K (trans)), the rate constant EES to plasma (K (ep)), plasma volume (V (p)), and EES volume (V (e)). All (semi)quantitative parameters were compared between GB and RN using the Mann-Whitney U test. ROC analysis was performed.; Wash-in rate (k) and wash-out rate (D) were significantly higher in GB compared to RN using curve fitting (p = 0.016 and p = 0.014). TTPF and TTPO were significantly lower in GB compared to RN (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). The highest sensitivity (87 %) and specificity (80 %) were obtained for TTPF by applying a threshold of 581 s. K (trans), K (ep), and V (e) were not significantly different between GB and RN. A trend towards higher V (p) values was found in GB compared to RN, indicating angiogenesis in GB (p = 0.075).; Based on our results, in a rat model of GB and RN, wash-in rate, wash-out rate, and the time to peak extracted from DCE-MRI time series data may be useful to discriminate GB from RN.

N2  -  Background: To determine if filtration-histogram based texture analysis (MRTA) of clinical MR imaging can noninvasively identify molecular subtypes of untreated gliomas.
Methods: Post Gadolinium T1-weighted (T1+ Gad) images, T2-weighted (T2) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of 97 gliomas (54=WHO II, 20=WHO III, 23=WHO IV) between 2010 and 2016 were studied. Whole-tumor segmentations were performed on a proprietary texture analysis research platform (TexRAD, Cambridge, UK) using the software's freehand drawing tool. MRTA commences with a filtration step, followed by quantification of texture using histogram texture parameters. Results were correlated using nonparametric statistics with a logistic regression model generated.; Results: T1+ Gad performed best for IDH typing of glioblastoma (sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.945) and ADC for non-Gadolinium-enhancing gliomas (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 78.4%, AUC 0.877). T2 was moderately precise (sensitivity 83.1%, specificity 78.9%, AUC 0.821). Excellent results for IDH typing were achieved from a combination of the three sequences (sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 94.5%, AUC=0.98). For discriminating 1p19q genotypes, ADC produced the best results using unfiltered textures (sensitivity 80.6%, specificity 89.3%, AUC 0.811).; Conclusion: Preoperative glioma genotyping with MRTA appears valuable with potential for clinical translation. The optimal choice of texture parameters is influenced by sequence choice, tumour morphology and segmentation method.

N2  -  Background: Pyogenic ventriculitis is a rare and severe cerebral infection. It may result from the rupture of brain abscess, neurosurgical procedures, hematogenous spread and so on. Contiguously diffusion through spinal dura from erector spinae muscle abscess is rare. Moreover, pyogenic ventriculitis caused by Streptococcus intermedius is rare. We reported a patient with pyogenic ventriculitis secondary to erector spinae muscle abscess owing to Streptococcus intermedius infection. Case presentation: A 61-year-old male with diabetes mellitus had been initially suffered from backache, then presented with fatigue and postural tremor when standing. On the second day of admission, he suffered from retention of urine and disturbance of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed pyogenic ventriculitis. And enhanced computed tomography of the lumbar vertebra revealed abscess in the right erector spinae muscle, which helped us identified the pathogen as Streptococcus intermedius through the pus drainaged from the lesions. After antibiotic treatment for two and a half months, association with drainage of the abscess for one month, the cerebrospinal fluid tended to normal. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt operation was performed at last as the complication of hydrocephalus. The outcome of the patient was relatively good. Conclusion: S. intermedius has an affinity for invading the brain. Poor glycemic control with sustained hyperglycemia is the risk factor for abscess formation. Pyogenic ventriculitis can be caused by contiguously diffusion through spinal dura from the erector spinae muscle abscess.

N2  -  Background
Neuroimaging may guide acute stroke treatment by measuring the volume of brain tissue in the irreversibly injured "ischemic core." The most widely accepted core volume measurement technique is diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). However, some claim that measuring regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) with CT perfusion imaging (CTP), and labeling tissue below some threshold as the core, provides equivalent estimates. We tested whether any threshold allows reliable substitution of CBF for DWI.; Methods; 58 patients with suspected stroke underwent DWI and CTP within six hours of symptom onset. A neuroradiologist outlined DWI lesions. In CBF maps, core pixels were defined by thresholds ranging from 0%-100% of normal, in 1% increments. Replicating prior studies, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to select thresholds that optimized sensitivity and specificity in predicting DWI-positive pixels, first using only pixels on the side of the brain where infarction was clinically suspected ("unilateral" method), then including both sides ("bilateral"). We quantified each method and threshold's accuracy in estimating DWI volumes, using sums of squared errors (SSE). For the 23 patients with follow-up studies, we assessed whether CBF-derived volumes inaccurately exceeded follow-up infarct volumes.; Results; The areas under the ROC curves were 0.89 (unilateral) and 0.90 (bilateral). Various metrics selected optimum CBF thresholds ranging from 29%-32%, with sensitivities of 0.79-0.81, and specificities of 0.83-0.85. However, for the unilateral and bilateral methods respectively, volume estimates derived from all CBF thresholds above 28% and 22% were less accurate than disregarding imaging and presuming every patient's core volume to be zero. The unilateral method with a 30% threshold, which recent clinical trials have employed, produced a mean core overestimation of 65 mL (range: -82-191), and exceeded follow- up volumes for 83% of patients, by up to 191 mL.; Conclusion; CTP-derived CBF maps cannot substitute for DWI in measuring the ischemic core.

N2  -  Background: MRI-based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) visualizes the local differences in water diffusion in vivo. The prognostic value of DWI signal intensities on the source images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps respectively has not yet been studied in brain metastases (BM).
Methods: We included into this retrospective analysis all patients operated for single BM at our institution between 2002 and 2010, in whom presurgical DWI and BM tissue samples were available. We recorded relevant clinical data, assessed DWI signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and performed histopathological analysis of BM tissues. Statistical analyses including uni- and multivariate survival analyses were performed.; Results: 65 patients (34 female, 31 male) with a median overall survival time (OS) of 15 months (range 0-99 months) were available for this study. 19 (29.2%) patients presented with hyper-, 3 (4.6%) with iso-, and 43 (66.2%) with hypointense DWI. ADCmean values could be determined in 32 (49.2%) patients, ranged from 456.4 to 1691.8*10(-6) mm(2)s (median 969.5) and showed a highly significant correlation with DWI signal intensity. DWI hyperintensity correlated significantly with high amount of interstitial reticulin deposition. In univariate analysis, patients with hyperintense DWI (5 months) and low ADCmean values (7 months) had significantly worse OS than patients with isohypointense DWI (16 months) and high ADCmean values (30 months), respectively. In multivariate survival analysis, high ADCmean values retained independent statistical significance.; Conclusions: Preoperative DWI findings strongly and independently correlate with OS in patients operated for single BM and are related to interstitial fibrosis. Inclusion of DWI parameters into established risk stratification scores for BM patients should be considered.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in neurosurgical planning allows identification of white matter tracts and has been associated with a reduction in postoperative functional deficits.
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relationship between the lesion-to-tract distance (LTD) and postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with brain tumors in order to evaluate the role of DTI in predicting postoperative outcomes.; METHODS: Adult patients with brain tumors (n = 60) underwent preoperative DTI. Three major white matter pathways (superior longitudinal fasciculi SLF, cingulum, and corticospinal tract) were identified using DTI images, and the shortest LTD was measured for each tract. Postoperative morbidity and mortality information was collected from electronic medical records.; RESULTS: The ipsilesional corticospinal tract LTD and left SLF LTD were significantly associated with the occurrence rate of total postoperative motor (P = .018) and language (P < .001) deficits, respectively. The left SLF LTD was also significantly associated with the occurrence rate of new postoperative language deficits (P = .003), and the LTD threshold that best predicted this occurrence was 1 cm (P < .001). Kaplan-Meier log-rank survival analyses in patients having high-grade tumors demonstrated a significantly higher mortality for patients with a left SLF LTD < 1 cm (P = .01).; CONCLUSION: Measuring tumor proximity to major white matter tracts using DTI can inform clinicians of the likelihood of postoperative functional deficits. A distance of 1 cm or less from eloquent white matter structures most significantly predicts the occurrence of new deficits with current surgical and imaging techniques.

T2  -  BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR

N2  -  Background and purpose: Blood-brain barrier disruption during the earliest phases of lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is commonly ascribed to perivenular inflammatory activity and is usually accompanied by increased diffusivity. Reduced diffusivity has also been shown in active lesions, albeit less frequently. This study aimed to characterize the development and natural history of contrast-enhanced lesions by weekly following five relapsing remitting (RR) MS patients. Materials and methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion imaging, FLAIR and contrast-enhanced 3D T1-weighted MR, were weekly performed on five untreated patients recently diagnosed with RR MS. Results: All five patients showed significant increases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the lesions compared to the first time point. One of the five patients presented 98 active lesions on ADC maps among which 36 had a volume larger than 10mm(3). In two of these lesions, a 1week transient decrease in ADC was detected at the time of the first gadolinium enhancement. Also, the perfusion analysis showed a concomitant increase in the relative cerebral blood volume. Conclusions: The infrequency detection of such ADC decrease in a new lesion is probably due to its very short duration. This observation may be consistent with a hyper-acute inflammatory stage concomitant with an increased reactional perfusion.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carbon monoxide intoxication has delayed effects on the cerebral white matter characterized by bilateral, confluent lesions that reflect diffuse demyelination. To increase our understanding of this process, we assessed the diffusion characteristics of these lesions.
METHODS: Five consecutive patients with delayed encephalopathy of CO intoxication were examined with diffusion MR imaging. Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were obtained 25-95 days after their exposure to CO and during a relapse of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which occurred after an initial recovery. Imaging was performed at 1.5 T by using a spin-echo echo-planar sequence with diffusion gradients of 0, 500, and 1000 smm(2). DwIs and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were visually evaluated, and mean ADCs were calculated from the periventricular white matter and the centrum semiovale, where confluent hyperintensity was seen on T2-weighted images. Findings were compared with those of normal-looking white matter.; RESULTS: In all five patients, both T2-weighted images and DwIs showed the white matter lesions as bilateral, diffuse, confluent areas of hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale. On ADC maps, these lesions were isointense, with focal areas of hypointensity (n = 4) or diffuse hypointensity (n = 1). Mean ADC values of the white matter lesions were significantly lower than those of normal-looking white matter, regardless of their isointensity or hypointensity on ADC maps (P < .05).; CONCLUSION. Bilateral, confluent, white matter lesions in patients with delayed encephalopathy of CO intoxication show decreased diffusivity.

N2  -  In a multicenter setting, we applied voxel-based methods to different structural MR imaging modalities to define the relative contributions of focal lesions, normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and gray matter (GM) damage and their regional distribution to cognitive deficits as well as impairment of specific cognitive domains in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Approval of the institutional review boards was obtained, together with written informed consent from all participants. Standardized neuropsychological assessment and conventional, diffusion tensor and volumetric brain MRI sequences were collected from 61 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 61 healthy controls (HC) from seven centers. Patients with 2 abnormal tests were considered cognitively impaired (CI). The distribution of focal lesions, GM and WM atrophy, and microstructural WM damage were assessed using voxel-wise approaches. A random forest analysis identified the best imaging predictors of global cognitive impairment and deficits of specific cognitive domains. Twenty-three (38%) MS patients were CI. Compared with cognitively preserved (CP), CI MS patients had GM atrophy of the left thalamus, right hippocampus and parietal regions. They also showed atrophy of several WM tracts, mainly located in posterior brain regions and widespread WM diffusivity abnormalities. WM diffusivity abnormalities in cognitive-relevant WM tracts followed by atrophy of cognitive-relevant GM regions explained global cognitive impairment. Variable patterns of NAWM and GM damage were associated with deficits in selected cognitive domains. Structural, multiparametric, voxel-wise MRI approaches are feasible in a multicenter setting. The combination of different imaging modalities is needed to assess and monitor cognitive impairment in MS. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1627-1644, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite a recent resurgence, intravoxel incoherent motion MRI faces practical challenges, including limited SNR and demanding acquisition and postprocessing requirements. A simplified approach using linear fitting of a subset of higher b-values has seen success in other organ systems. We sought to validate this method for evaluation of brain pathology by comparing perfusion measurements using simplified linear fitting to conventional biexponential fitting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with gliomas and 17 with acute strokes underwent 3T MRI, including DWI with 16 b-values (range, 0 900 smm(2)). Conventional intravoxel incoherent motion was performed using nonlinear fitting of the standard biexponential equation. Simplified intravoxel incoherent motion was performed using linear fitting of the log-normalized signal curves for subsets of b-values >200 smm(2). Comparisons between ROIs (tumors, strokes, contralateral brain) and between models (biexponential and simplified linear) were performed by using 2-way ANOVA. The root mean square error and coefficient of determination (R-2) were computed for the simplified model, with biexponential fitting as the reference standard.; RESULTS: Perfusion maps using simplified linear fitting were qualitatively similar to conventional biexponential fitting. The perfusion fraction was elevated in high-grade (n = 33) compared to low-grade (n = 16) gliomas and was reduced in strokes compared to the contralateral brain (P<.001 for both main effects). Decreasing the number of b-values used for linear fitting resulted in reduced accuracy (higher root mean square error and lower R-2) compared with full biexponential fitting.; CONCLUSIONS: Intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion imaging of common brain pathology can be performed by using simplified linear fitting, with preservation of clinically relevant perfusion information.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Gliomas invading the anterior corpus callosum are commonly deemed unresectable due to an unacceptable risk/benefit ratio, including the risk of abulia. In this study, the authors investigated the anatomy of the cingulum and its connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). A technique is described involving awake subcortical mapping with higher attention tasks to preserve the cingulum and reduce the incidence of postoperative abulia for patients with so-called butterfly gliomas.
METHODS The authors reviewed clinical data on all patients undergoing glioma surgery performed by the senior author during a 4-year period at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Forty patients were identified who underwent surgery for butterfly gliomas. Each patient was designated as having undergone surgery either with or without the use of awake subcortical mapping and preservation of the cingulum. Data recorded on these patients included the incidence of abuliaakinetic mutism. In the context of the study findings, the authors conducted a detailed anatomical study of the cingulum and its role within the DMN using postmortem fiber tract dissections of 10 cerebral hemispheres and in vivo diffusion tractography of 10 healthy subjects.; RESULTS Forty patients with butterfly gliomas were treated, 25 (62%) with standard surgical methods and 15 (38%) with awake subcortical mapping and preservation of the cingulum. One patient (115, 7%) experienced postoperative abulia following surgery with the cingulum-sparing technique. Greater than 90% resection was achieved in 1315 (87%) of these patients.; CONCLUSIONS This study presents evidence that anterior butterfly gliomas can be safely removed using a novel, attention-task based, awake brain surgery technique that focuses on preserving the anatomical connectivity of the cingulum and relevant aspects of the cingulate gyrus.

N2  -  A sensitive and efficient imaging technique is required to assess the subtle abnormalities occurring in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal-appearing grey matter (NAGM) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In this study, a fast 3D macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) quantification based on spin-lock (fast MPF-SL) sequence was proposed for brain MPF mapping. Thirty-four participants, including 17 healthy controls and 17 RRMS patients were prospectively recruited. We conducted group comparison and correlation between conventional MPF-SL, fast MPF-SL, and DWI, and compared differences in quantified parameters within MS lesions and the regional NAWM, NAGM, and normal-appearing deep grey matter (NADGN). MPF of MS lesions was significantly reduced (7.17% +/- 1.15%, P < 0.01) compared to all corresponding normal-appearing regions. MS patients also showed significantly reduced mean MPF values compared with controls in NAGM (4.87% +/- 0.38% vs 5.21% +/- 0.32%, P = 0.01), NAWM (9.49% +/- 0.69% vs 10.32% +/- 0.59%, P < 0.01) and NADGM (thalamus 5.59% +/- 0.67% vs 6.00% +/- 0.41%, P = 0.04; caudate 5.10% +/- 0.55% vs 5.53% +/- 0.58%, P = 0.03). MPF and ADC showed abnormalities in otherwise normal appearing close to lesion areas (P < 0.01). In conclusion, time-efficient MPF mapping of the whole brain can be acquired efficiently (< 3 min) using fast MPF-SL. It offers a promising alternative way to detect white matter abnormalities in MS.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion measurement in multiple sclerosis (MS) may cast light on the disease pathogenesis and lesion development since vascular pathology is frequently demonstrated in the disease. This study was performed to investigate the perfusion characteristics in MS lesions using dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging (DSC-MRI) to better understand the hemodynamic changes in MS.
METHODS: Seventeen patients with relapsing-remitting MS were studied with DSC-MRI. Perfusion measurements included cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT), were obtained in enhancing, non-enhancing lesions covered by DSC-MRI and contralateral normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients as well as normal white matter in seventeen control subjects.; RESULTS: DSC-MRI data demonstrated reduced perfusion with significantly prolonged MTT (P < 0.001) in lesions and NAWM in patients compared with normal white matter in controls. Compared to contralateral NAWM, enhancing lesions demonstrate increased CBF (P = 0.007) and CBV (P < 0.0001), indicating inflammation-mediated vasodilatation. A K means cluster analysis was performed and identifies approximately 63.8% of non-enhancing lesions (Class 1) with significantly decreased perfusion (P :5 0.0001) when compared with contralateral NAWM. In contrast, the remainder 36.2% non-enhancing lesions (Class 2) show increased CBV (P = 0.02) in a similar fashion to enhancing lesions and can be observed on quantitative color-coded maps even without blood-brain barrier breakdown.; CONCLUSION. DSC-MRI measurements demonstrate potential for investigating hemodynamic abnormalities that are associated with inflammatory activity, lesion reactivity and vascular compromise in MS lesions. Non-enhancing lesions showed both low and high perfusion suggesting microvascular abnormalities with hemodynamic impairment and inflammatory reactivity that cannot be seen on conventional MRI.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Despite being the gold standard technique for stroke assessment, conventional diffusion MRI provides only partial information about tissue microstructure. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an advanced diffusion MRI method that yields, in addition to conventional diffusion information, the diffusional kurtosis, which may help improve characterization of tissue microstructure. In particular, this additional information permits the description of white matter (WM) in terms of WM-specific diffusion metrics. The goal of this study is to elucidate possible biophysical mechanisms underlying ischemia using these new WM metrics.
Methods-We performed a retrospective review of clinical and diffusional kurtosis imaging data of 44 patients with acutesubacute ischemic stroke. Patients with a history of brain neoplasm or intracranial hemorrhages were excluded from this study. Region of interest analysis was performed to measure percent change of diffusion metrics in ischemic WM lesions compared with the contralateral hemisphere.; Results-Kurtosis maps exhibit distinct ischemic lesion heterogeneity that is not apparent on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Kurtosis metrics also have significantly higher absolute percent change than complementary conventional diffusion metrics. Our WM metrics reveal an increase in axonal density and a larger decrease in the intra-axonal (D-a) compared with extra-axonal diffusion microenvironment of the ischemic WM lesion.; Conclusions-The well-known decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of WM after ischemia is found to be mainly driven by a significant drop in the intra-axonal diffusion microenvironment. Our results suggest that ischemia preferentially alters intra-axonal environment, consistent with a proposed mechanism of focal enlargement of axons known as axonal swelling or beading.

N2  -  Recent studies on patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) demonstrated thalamic atrophy. Here we addressed the following question: Is early thalamic atrophy in patients with CIS and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) mainly a direct consequence of white matter (WM) lesionsas frequently claimedor is the atrophy stronger correlated to silent (nonlesional) microstructural thalamic alterations? One-hundred and ten patients with RRMS, 12 with CIS, and 30 healthy controls were admitted to 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess thalamic and WM microstructure. The relative thalamic volume (RTV) and thalamic FA were significantly reduced in patients with CIS and RRMS relative to healthy controls. Both measures were also correlated. The age, gender, WM lesion load, thalamic FA, and gray matter volume-corrected RTV were reduced even in the absence of thalamic and extensive white matter lesionsalso in patients with short disease duration (24 months). A voxel-based correlation analysis revealed that the RTV reduction had a significant effect on local WM FAin areas next to the thalamus and basal ganglia. These WM alterations could not be explained by WM lesions, which had a differing spatial distribution. Early thalamic atrophy is mainly driven by silent microstructural thalamic alterations. Lesions do not disclose the early damage of thalamocortical circuits, which seem to be much more affected in CIS and RRMS than expected. Thalamocortical damage can be detected by DTI in normal appearing brain tissue. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1866-1879, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Objectives To evaluate the diffusion kurtosis and susceptibility change in the U-fiber region of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (pwRRMS) and their correlations with cognitive status and degeneration.Materials and methods Mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), radial kurtosis (RK), kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA), and the mean relative quantitative susceptibility mapping (mrQSM) values in the U-fiber region were compared between 49 pwRRMS and 48 healthy controls (HCs). The U-fiber were divided into upper and deeper groups based on the location. The whole brain volume, gray and white matter volume, and cortical thickness were obtained. The correlations between the mrQSM values, DKI-derived metrics in the U-fiber region and clinical scale scores, brain morphologic parameters were further investigated.Results The decreased MK, AK, RK, KFA, and increased mrQSM values in U-fiber lesions (p < 0.001, FDR corrected), decreased RK, KFA, and increased mrQSM values in U-fiber non-lesions (p = 0.034, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, FDR corrected) were found in pwRRMS. There were differences in DKI-derived metrics and susceptibility values between the upper U-fiber region and the deeper one for U-fiber non-lesion areas of pwRRMS and HCs (p < 0.05), but not for U-fiber lesions in DKI-derived metrics. The DKI-derived metrics and susceptibility values were widely related with cognitive tests and brain atrophy.Conclusion RRMS patients show abnormal diffusion kurtosis and susceptibility characteristics in the U-fiber region, and these underlying tissue abnormalities are correlated with cognitive deficits and degeneration.Clinical relevance statement The macroscopic and microscopic tissue damages of U-fiber help to identify cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis and provide underlying pathophysiological mechanism.

N2  -  Introduction With the application of high-resolution 3D 7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) in high-grade gliomas, we previously identified intratumoral metabolic heterogeneities. In this study, we evaluated the potential of 3D 7 T-MRSI for the preoperative noninvasive classification of glioma grade and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status. We demonstrated that IDH mutation and glioma grade are detectable by ultra-high field (UHF) MRI. This technique might potentially optimize the perioperative management of glioma patients.Introduction With the application of high-resolution 3D 7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) in high-grade gliomas, we previously identified intratumoral metabolic heterogeneities. In this study, we evaluated the potential of 3D 7 T-MRSI for the preoperative noninvasive classification of glioma grade and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status. We demonstrated that IDH mutation and glioma grade are detectable by ultra-high field (UHF) MRI. This technique might potentially optimize the perioperative management of glioma patients.Methods We prospectively included 36 patients with WHO 2021 grade 2-4 gliomas (20 IDH mutated, 16 IDH wildtype). Our 7 T 3D MRSI sequence provided high-resolution metabolic maps (e.g., choline, creatine, glutamine, and glycine) of these patients' brains. We employed multivariate random forest and support vector machine models to voxels within a tumor segmentation, for classification of glioma grade and IDH mutation status.Results Random forest analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 for multivariate IDH classification based on metabolic ratios. We distinguished high- and low-grade tumors by total choline (tCho) / total N-acetyl-aspartate (tNAA) ratio difference, yielding an AUC of 0.99. Tumor categorization based on other measured metabolic ratios provided comparable accuracy.Conclusions We successfully classified IDH mutation status and high- versus low-grade gliomas preoperatively based on 7 T MRSI and clinical tumor segmentation. With this approach, we demonstrated imaging based tumor marker predictions at least as accurate as comparable studies, highlighting the potential application of MRSI for pre-operative tumor classifications.

N2  -  PurposeTo explore the feasibility and diagnostic performance of radiomics based on anatomical, diffusion and perfusion MRI in differentiating among glioma subtypes and predicting tumour proliferation.Methods220 pathology-confirmed gliomas and ten contrasts were included in the retrospective analysis. After being registered to T2FLAIR images and resampling to 1 mm(3) isotropically, 431 radiomics features were extracted from each contrast map within a semi-automatic defined tumour volume. For single-contrast and the combination of all contrasts, correlations between the radiomics features and pathological biomarkers were revealed by partial correlation analysis, and multivariate models were built to identify the best predictive models with adjusted 0.632+ bootstrap AUC.ResultsIn univariate analysis, both non-wavelet and wavelet radiomics features were correlated significantly with tumour grade and the Ki-67 labelling index. The max R was 0.557 (p=2.04E-14) in T1C for tumour grade and 0.395 (p=2.33E-07) in ADC for Ki-67. In the multivariate analysis, the combination of all-contrast radiomics features had the highest AUCs in both differentiating among glioma subtypes and predicting proliferation compared with those in single-contrast images. For low-/high-grade gliomas, the best AUC was 0.911. In differentiating among glioma subtypes, the best AUC was 0.896 for grades II-III, 0.997 for grades II-IV, and 0.881 for grades III-IV. In predicting proliferation levels, multicontrast features led to an AUC of 0.936.ConclusionMulticontrast radiomics supplies complementary information on both geometric characters and molecular biological traits, which correlated significantly with tumour grade and proliferation. Combining all-contrast radiomics models might precisely predict glioma biological behaviour, which may be attributed to presurgical personal diagnosis.Key Points center dot Multicontrast MRI radiomics features are significantly correlated with tumour grade and Ki-67 LI.center dot Multimodality MRI provides independent but supplemental information in assessing glioma pathological behaviour.center dot Combined multicontrast MRI radiomics can precisely predict glioma subtypes and proliferation levels.

N2  -  While rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) in animals has been associated with stuctural brain stem lesions since the very beginning of RBD research, human brain imaging of RBD did not reveal specific results at first. It was later that single cases of symptomatic RBD due to inflammatory, neoplastic or ischemic lesions were described. Only recently, systematic voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies for RBD have been performed. The SINBAR Sleep Innsbruck Barcelona Group investigated 26 idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients and 14 age-matched controls with both statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and DTI. Substantial decreases of fractional anisotropy in midbrain tegmentum and rostral pons were found, and mean diffusivity was increased in midbrain and pontine reticular formation. In addition, VBM revealed an increase of gray matter densities in both hippocampi of iRBD patients. The Marburg group performed DTI in 12 iRBD and 12 controls and reported microstructural changes in the brainstem, substantia nigra, olfactory region, left temporal lobe, coronal radiata and the right visual stream. A recent study performed VBM in 20 iRBD and compared the findings to 18 age-matched controls. This study found significant gray matter volume reduction in the anterior lobes of the cerebellum, the pontine tegmentum and the left parahippocampal gyrus. In summary, the areas highlighted from these studies are in line with areas regulating features of REM sleep, and in part with evolving synucleinopathies.

N2  -  Background Medulloblastoma, a high-grade embryonal tumor, is the most common primary brain malignancy in the pediatric population. Molecular medulloblastoma groups have documented clinically and biologically relevant characteristics. Several authors have attempted to differentiate medulloblastoma molecular groups and histology variants using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. However, literature on the use of ADC histogram analysis in medulloblastomas is still scarce. Objective This study presents data from a sizable group of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma from a single institution to determine the performance of ADC histogram metrics for differentiating medulloblastoma variants and groups based on both histological and molecular features. Materials and methods In this retrospective study, we evaluated the distribution of absolute and normalized ADC values of medulloblastomas. Tumors were manually segmented and diffusivity metrics calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We calculated a variety of first-order histogram metrics from the ADC maps, including entropy, minimum, 10th percentile, 90th percentile, maximum, mean, median, skewness and kurtosis, to differentiate molecular and histological variants. ADC values of the tumors were also normalized to the bilateral cerebellar cortex and thalami. We used the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests to evaluate differences between the groups. We carried out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the areas under the curves and to determine the cut-off values for differentiating tumor groups. Results We found 65 children with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of medulloblastoma. Mean age was 8.3 +/- 5.8 years, and 60% (n = 39) were male. One child was excluded because histopathological variant could not be determined. In terms of medulloblastoma variants, tumors were classified as classic (n = 47), desmoplastic/nodular (n = 9), large/cell anaplastic (n = 6) or as having extensive nodularity (n = 2). Seven other children were excluded from the study because of incomplete imaging or equivocal molecular diagnosis. Regarding medulloblastoma molecular groups, there were: wingless (WNT) group (n = 7), sonic hedgehog (SHH) group (n = 14) and non-WNT/non-SHH (n = 36). Our results showed significant differences among the molecular groups in terms of the median (P = 0.002), mean (P = 0.003) and 90th percentile (P = 0.002) ADC histogram metrics. No significant differences among the various medulloblastoma histological variants were found. Conclusion ADC histogram analysis can be implemented as a complementary tool in the preoperative evaluation of medulloblastoma in children. This technique can provide valuable information for differentiating among medulloblastoma molecular groups. ADC histogram metrics can help predict medulloblastoma molecular classification preoperatively.

N2  -  Multi-parametric tissue characterisation is demonstrated using a 4-minute protocol based on diffusion trace acquisitions. Three diffusion regimes are covered simultaneously: pseudo-perfusion, Gaussian, and non-Gaussian diffusion. The clinical utility of this method for fast multi-parametric mapping for brain tumours is explored. A cohort of 17 brain tumour patients was measured on a 3T hybrid MR-PET scanner with a standard clinical MRI protocol, to which the proposed multi-parametric diffusion protocol was subsequently added. For comparison purposes, standard perfusion and a full diffusion kurtosis protocol were acquired. Simultaneous amino-acid (F-18-FET) PET enabled the identification of active tumour tissue. The metrics derived from the proposed protocol included perfusion fraction, pseudo-diffusivity, apparent diffusivity, and apparent kurtosis. These metrics were compared to the corresponding metrics from the dedicated acquisitions: cerebral blood volume and flow, mean diffusivity and mean kurtosis. Simulations were carried out to assess the influence of fitting methods and noise levels on the estimation of the parameters. The diffusion and kurtosis metrics obtained from the proposed protocol show strong to very strong correlations with those derived from the conventional protocol. However, a bias towards lower values was observed. The pseudo-perfusion parameters showed very weak to weak correlations compared to their perfusion counterparts. In conclusion, we introduce a clinically applicable protocol for measuring multiple parameters and demonstrate its relevance to pathological tissue characterisation.

N2  -  PURPOSEAccurate glioma grading is crucial for treatment planning and predicting prognosis. We performed a quantitative volumetric analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of histogram analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-weighted perfusion imaging in the preoperative evaluation of gliomas.
METHODSSixty-three consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed gliomas who underwent baseline DWI and DCE-MRI were enrolled. The patients were classified by histopathology according to tumor grade: 20 low-grade gliomas (grade II) and 43 high-grade gliomas (grades III and IV). Volumes-of-interest were calculated and transferred to DCE perfusion and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Histogram analysis was performed to determine mean and maximum values for V-p and K-trans, and mean and minimum values for ADC. Comparisons between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, and between grades II, III, and IV, were performed. A Mann-Whitney U test at a significance level of corrected P .01 was used to assess differences.; RESULTSAll perfusion parameters could differentiate between high-grade and low-grade gliomas (P < .001) and between grades II and IV, grades II and III, and grades III and IV. Significant differences in minimum ADC were also found (P < .01). Mean ADC only differed significantly between high and low grades and grades II and IV (P < .01). There were no differences between grades II and III (P = .1) and grades III and IV (P = .71).; CONCLUSIONWhen derived from whole-tumor histogram analysis, DCE-MRI perfusion parameters performed better than ADC in noninvasively discriminating low- from high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Fiber tracking in combination with functional MRI has recently attracted strong interest, as it may help to elucidate the structural basis for functional connectivities and may be selective in the determination of the fiber bundles responsible for a particular circuit. Diffusion spectrum imaging provides a more complex analysis of fiber circuits than the commonly used diffusion tensor imaging approach, also allowing the discrimination of crossing fibers in the brain. For the understanding of pathophysiological alterations during brain lesion and recovery, such studies need to be extended to small-animal models. In this article, we present the first study combining functional MRI with high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging in vivo. We have chosen the well-characterized electrical forepaw stimulation paradigm in the rat to examine the thalamo-cortical pathway. Using the functionally activated areas in both thalamus and somatosensory cortex as seed and target regions for fiber tracking, we are able to characterize the fibers responsible for this stimulation pathway. Moreover, we show that the selection of the thalamic nucleus and primary somatosensory cortex on the basis of anatomical description results in a larger fiber bundle, probably encompassing connectivities between the thalamus and other areas of the somatosensory cortex, such as the hindpaw and large barrel field cortex.

N2  -  The locus and extent of brain damage in the event of vascular insult can be quantitatively established quickly and easily with vascular atlases. Although highly anticipated by clinicians and clinical researchers, no digital MRI arterial atlas is readily available for automated data analyses. We created a digital arterial territory atlas based on lesion distributions in 1,298 patients with acute stroke. The lesions were manually traced in the diffusion-weighted MRIs, binary stroke masks were mapped to a common space, probability maps of lesions were generated and the boundaries for each arterial territory was defined based on the ratio between probabilistic maps. The atlas contains the definition of four major supra- and infra-tentorial arterial territories: Anterior, Middle, Posterior Cerebral Arteries and Vertebro-Basilar, and sub-territories (thalamoperforating, lenticulostriate, basilar and cerebellar arterial territories), in two hierarchical levels. This study provides the first publicly-available, digital, 3D deformable atlas of arterial brain territories, which may serve as a valuable resource for large-scale, reproducible processing and analysis of brain MRIs of patients with stroke and other conditions.

N2  -  Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder especially in pediatric population. Patients with non-lesional epilepsy have normal conventional MRI findings. In the recent era of advances in neuroimaging studies, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) can assess the tissue microstructure. Also, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive modality that evaluates cerebral blood flow. Multiple recent publications aimed at use of single or two new modalities in lateralization of epileptogenic focus in epilepsy, but the current study aimed to evaluate the added value of combined (DTI, ASL and MRS) in vivo localization of interactable epilepsy with negative conventional MRI findings.
Results This prospective case control study was carried out in the period from January 1st, 2022 to October 1st, 2022 after approval of local ethical committee in our institution. Written informed consent was obtained from patients and healthy volunteers who were enrolled in this study. The current study included 46 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers as a control group. The mean age in the patient group was 22.3 +- 12.2 years, and in the control group, it was 23.8 +- 15.1 years. The highest area under the curve (AUC) was for spectroscopy (0.913), the difference in NAACr showed sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 90%, while NAACho + Cr showed a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 88%, the difference in rCBF showed an AUC of 0.89, with a cutoff value of 3.815 had a sensitivity of 80.4% and a specificity of 85%. As regards DTI, the changes in DTI parameters show sensitivity of 79.6% and a specificity of 80% in lateralization of the epileptic focus. The difference in FA only showed an AUC of 0.86, with a cutoff value of 0.01 had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 75% and the difference in MD only showed an AUC of 0.771, with a cutoff value of 0.545 had a sensitivity of 67.4% and a specificity of 70%. The diagnostic performance of MRS in terms of the AUC was significantly higher than ASL parameters (difference in NAACr, p = 0.033 and difference in NAACho + Cr, p = 0.044), and MD (p = 0.02). No other statistically significant differences were shown between the studied parameters. When the three methods were combined, all patients' epileptogenic foci were correctly localized and lateralized.; Conclusions Combining ASL, DTI and H-MRS provided excellent diagnostic performance in localization and lateralization of the epileptogenic focus. If this combination is not applicable in clinical practice, ASL could provide a considerably accurate and feasible method in this context. The present study supported the value of the new noninvasive MRI techniques in the elaboration of hidden brain pathology.

N2  -  The therapeutic management of brain metastases depends upon their diagnosis and characteristics. It is therefore imperative that imaging provides accurate diagnosis, identification, size and localization information of intracranial lesions in patients with presumed cerebral metastatic disease. MRI exhibits superior sensitivity to CT for small lesions identification and to evaluate their precise anatomical location. The CT-scan will be made only in case of MRI's contraindication or if MRI cannot be obtained in an acceptable delay for the management of the patient. In clinical practice, the radiologic metastasis evaluation is based on visual image analyses. Thus, a particular attention is paid to the imaging protocol with the aim to optimize the diagnosis of small lesions and to evaluate their evolution. The MRI protocol must include: 1) non-contrast TI. 2) diffusion, 3) 12* or susceptibility-weighted imaging. 4) dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, 5) FLAIR with contrast injection, 6) T1 with contrast injection preferentially using the 3D spin echo images. The role of the nuclear medicine imaging is still limited in the diagnosis of brain metastasis. The Tc-sestamibi brain imaging or PET with amino acid tracers can differentiate local brain metastasis recurrence from radionecrosis but still to be evaluated.

N2  -  Featured ApplicationMR-derived cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in contrast-enhancing and peritumoral non-enhancing regions, as calculated by an artificial neural network, allows for robust differentiation of glioblastoma and brain metastasis.Glioblastoma may appear similar to cerebral metastasis on conventional MRI in some cases, but their therapies differ significantly. This prospective feasibility study was aimed at differentiating them by applying the quantitative susceptibility mapping and quantitative blood-oxygen-level-dependent (QSM + qBOLD) model to these entities for the first time. We prospectively included 15 untreated patients with glioblastoma (n = 7, median age: 68 years, range: 54-84 years) or brain metastasis (n = 8, median age 66 years, range: 50-78 years) who underwent preoperative MRI including multi-gradient echo and arterial spin labeling sequences. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were calculated in the contrast-enhancing tumor (CET) and peritumoral non-enhancing T2 hyperintense region (NET2), using an artificial neural network. We demonstrated that OEF in CET was significantly lower (p = 0.03) for glioblastomas than metastases, all features were significantly higher (p = 0.01) in CET than in NET2 for metastasis patients only, and the ratios of CET/NET2 for CBF (p = 0.04) and CMRO2 (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in metastasis patients than in glioblastoma patients. Discriminative power of a support-vector machine classifier was highest with a combination of two features, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 with 93% diagnostic accuracy. QSM + qBOLD allows for robust differentiation of glioblastoma and cerebral metastasis while yielding insights into tumor oxygenation.

N2  -  Neurological complications are common after liver transplantation, as they affect up to one-third of the transplanted patients and are associated with significant morbidity. The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine A and tacrolimus, in immunosuppressive regimens significantly improved the outcome of solid-organ transplantation even though immunosuppression-associated neurotoxicity remains a significant complication, particularly occurring in about 25% of cases after liver transplantation. The immunosuppressant cyclosporine A and tacrolimus have been associated with the occurrence of major neurological complications, diffuse encephalopathy being the most common. The biochemical and pathogenetic basis of calcineurin inhibitors-induced neurotoxicity are still unclear although several mechanisms have been suggested. Early recognition of symptoms could help reduce neurotoxic event. The aim of the study was to evaluate cerebral changes through MRI, in particular with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, in two patients undergoing liver transplantation after immunosuppressive therapy. We describe two patients in which clinical pictures, presenting as a severe neurological condition, early after orthotopic liver transplantation during immunosuppression therapy, showed a different evolution in keeping with evidence of focal-multifocal lesions at DWI and ADC maps. At clinical onset, DWI showed hyperintensity of the temporo-parieto-occipital cortex with normal ADC values in the patient with following good clinical recovery and decreased values in the other one; in the latter case, MRI abnormalities were still present after ten days, until the patient's exitus. The changes in DWI with normal ADC may be linked to brain edema with a predominant vasogenic component and therefore reversible, while the reduction in ADC is due to cytotoxic edema and linked to more severe, nonreversible, clinical picture. Brain MRI and particularly DWI and ADC maps provide not only a good and early representation of neurological complications during immunosuppressant therapy but can also provide a useful prognostic tool on clinical outcome of the patient.

N2  -  Background Computed tomography perfusion is becoming widely accepted and used in acute stroke treatment. Computed tomography perfusion provides pathophysiological information needed in the acute decision making. Moreover, computed tomography perfusion shows excellent correlation with diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted sequences to evaluate core and penumbra volumes. Multimodal computed tomography perfusion has practical advantages over magnetic resonance imaging, including availability, accessibility, and speed. Nevertheless, it bears some limitations, as the limited accuracy for small ischemic lesions or brainstem ischemia. Interpretation of the computed tomography perfusion maps can sometimes be difficult. The stroke neurologist faces complex or atypical cases of cerebral ischemia and stroke mimics, and needs to decide whether the lesions on computed tomography perfusion are real or artifact.
Aims The purpose of this review is, based on clinical cases from a comprehensive stroke center, to describe the added value that computed tomography perfusion can provide to the stroke physician in the acute phase before a treatment decision is made.

She had also developed numbness in her left extremities. An ophthalmological examination revealed inflammatory changes in the eye. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased cell counts, protein, and interleukin-6 levels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple high signal intensities on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of the pons and occipital and parietal lobes. The T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery high-signal-intensity lesion in the pons was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, suggesting cytotoxic oedema. Another high-signal-intensity lesion on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery was isointense to hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hyperintense on apparent diffusion coefficient, indicating vasogenic oedema. The vasogenic oedema in the left occipital lobe contained a small core that was hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient, suggesting cytotoxic oedema. The patient was diagnosed with acute neuro-Beh & ccedil;et's disease and responded well to high-dose glucocorticoid and colchicine treatment. The present report emphasises that patients with acute neuro-Beh & ccedil;et's disease may present with cytotoxic oedema in the pons and cerebral spheres. Further reports of similar cases would contribute to a better understanding of the role of cytotoxic oedema in the pathophysiology of neuro-Beh & ccedil;et's disease and help elucidate the mechanisms underlying a unique presentation characterised by a central cytotoxic oedema core within vasogenic oedema.

N2  -  Objective: To report a patient in whom an acute ischemic stroke precipitated chronic blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and expansion of vascular white matter hyperintensities (WMH) into regions of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) during the following year. Background: WMH are a common finding in patients with vascular risk factors such as a history of stroke. The pathophysiology of WMH is not fully understood; however, there is growing evidence to suggest that the development of WMH may be preceded by the BBB disruption in the NAWM. Methods: We studied a patient enrolled in the National Institutes of Health Natural History of Stroke Study who was scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after presenting to the emergency room with an acute stroke. After a treatment with IV tPA, she underwent further MRI scanning at 2 h, 24 h, 5 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1-year post stroke. BBB permeability images were generated from the perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) source images. MRIs from each time point were co-registered to track changes in BBB disruption and WMH over time. Results: An 84-year-old woman presented after acute onset right hemiparesis, right-sided numbness and aphasia with an initial NIHSS of 13. MRI showed diffusion restriction in the left frontal lobe and decreased blood flow on perfusion imaging. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral confluent WMH involving the deep white matter and periventricular regions. She was treated with IV tPA without complication and her NIHSS improved initially to 3 and ultimately to 0. Permeability maps identified multiple regions of chronic BBB disruption remote from the acute stroke, predominantly spanning the junction of WMH and NAWM. The severity of BBB disruption was greatest at 24 h after the stroke but persisted on subsequent MRI scans. Progression of WMH into NAWM over the year of observation was detected bilaterally but was most dramatic in the regions adjacent to the initial stroke. Conclusions: WMH-associated BBB disruption may be exacerbated by an acute stroke, even in the contralateral hemisphere, and can persist for months after the initial event. Transformation of NAWM to WMH may be evident in areas of BBB disruption within a year after the stroke. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between chronic BBB disruption and progressive WMH in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and the potential for acute stroke to trigger or exacerbate the process leading to the development of WMH.

N2  -  Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) measures can predict tissue outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Accuracy might be improved if differential tissue susceptibility to ischemia is considered. We present a novel voxel-by-voxel analysis to characterize cerebral blood flow (CBF) separately in gray (GM) and white matter (WM). Ten patients were scanned with inversion-recovery spin-echo EPI (IRSEPI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), PWI < 6h from onset and fluid attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) at 30 days. Image processing included coregistration to PWI, automatic segmentation of IRSEPI into GM, WM and CSF and semiautomatic segmentation of DWI/FLAIR to derive the acute and 30-day lesions. Five tissue compartments were defined: (1) 'Core' (abnormal acutely and at 30 days), (2) 'Growth' (or 'infarcted penumbra', abnormal only at 30 days), (3) 'Reversed' (abnormal acutely but normal at 30 days), (4) 'MTT-Delayed ' (tissue with delayed mean transit time but not part of the acute or 30-day lesion), and (5) 'Normal' brain. Cerebral blood flow in GM and WM of each compartment was obtained from quantitative maps. Gray matter and WM mean CBF in the growth region differed by 5.5ml/100gmin (P=0.015). Mean CBF also differed significantly within normal and MTT-Delayed compartments. The difference in the reversed region approached statistical significance. In core, GM and WM CBF did not differ. The results suggest separate ischemic thresholds for GM and WM in stroke penumbra.

N2  -  Background: Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a relatively novel technique to treat essential tremor (ET). The objective of this review was to analyze the efficacy and the safety profile of MRgFUS for ET.
Methods: A systematic literature review was done. The post procedure changes in the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) score, hand score, disability and quality of life scores were analyzed.; Results: We found 29 studies evaluating 617 patients. DTI based targeting was utilized in six cohorts. A significant difference was observed in the pooled standard mean difference between the pre and postoperative total CRST score (p-value < 0.001 and 0.0002), hand score (p-value 0.03 and 0.02); and the disability at 12 months (p-value 0.01). Head pain and dizziness were the most in procedure complications. The immediate pooled proportion of ataxia was 50%, while it was 20% for sensory complications, which, respectively, declined to 31 and 13% on long term follow up. A significant reduction (p = 0.03) in immediate ataxia related complications was seen with DTI targeting.; Conclusion: MRgFUS for ET seems to be an effective procedure for relieving unilateral tremor. Use of DTI based targeting revealed a significant reduction in post procedure ataxia related complications as compared to traditional targeting techniques. Analysis of other complications further revealed a decreasing trend on follow up.

N2  -  Purpose: To elucidate the factors associated with the preservation of function in relapsing-remitting (RR)multiple sclerosis (MS) by investigating effective connectivity changes of the sensorimotor network in pediatric RR MS patients in comparison with adult patients with either clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of MS or RR MS and in adult healthy control subjects by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MR) imaging and a dynamic causal model approach and to assess the correlation between effective connectivity changes and structural damage to the corpus callosum and the corticospinal tracts (CSTs).
Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Dual-echo, diffusion-tensor, and functional MR images were acquired from 17 pediatric RR MS patients, 16 adult patients with CIS, 14 adult RR MS patients, and 10 age-matched pediatric healthy control subjects during a simple motor task. Whole-brain, corpus callosum, and CST T2 lesion loads, as well as corpus callosum and CST diffusivity measures were determined. Functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using statistical parametric mapping.; Results: Coefficients of effective connectivity of the sensorimotor network were similar in control subjects and pediatric MS patients. In adult patients with CIS and even more evidently in those with RR MS, an increase of intra- and interhemispheric strengths of coefficients of effective connectivity was found (P = .05-.008). The increases in such coefficients were correlated with corpus callosum and CST damage, in terms of T2 lesion load and diffusion-tensor MR imaging quantities (r = -0.34 to 0.40).; Conclusion: The preservation of brain adaptive properties might explain the favorable medium-term clinical outcome of pediatric MS patients. The progressive recruitment of cortical networks over time in patients with the adult RR forms of the disease might result in a loss of their plastic reservoir, thus possibly contributing to subsequent disease evolution.

N2  -  In the present study glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was assessed following intravermian injection of kainic acid (KA) or physiological saline to adult rat cerebellum. After 2- to 30-day recovery period, free-floating sections cut with a microtome were obtained and were proccessed for immunocytochemistry against GFAP. Injection of both kainate and physiological saline elicited significant astrogliotic reaction, i.e. in the area around the lesion thick GFAP-positive Bergmann fibers with typical orientation appeared in the molecular and hypertrophied astrocytes abundantly appeared in the granular layer. However, following kainate intoxication lesion was not surrounded by typical demarcation glial scar during 30-day recovery period in contrast to the appearance of usual glial scar in the group injected with physiological saline, as early as 7-day postlesion. Preserved spatial organization of Bergmann fibers and the absence of typical demarcating glial scar after kainate-induced cerebellar lesion suggest distinct pattern of astrogliosis that presents an interesting model system to study the importance of glial scar in the recovery after ischemic brain insults.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Cerebral damage in frontal, parietal, and temporal brain areas and, probably more importantly, their interconnections can lead to deficits in language. However, neural plasticity and repair allow the brain to partly compensate for neural injury, mediated by both functional and structural changes. In this study, the authors sought to systematically investigate the relationship between language performance in brain tumor patients and structural perisylvian pathways (i.e., the arcuate fasciculus [AF]) using probabilistic fiber tracking on diffusion tensor imaging. The authors used a previously proposed model in which the AF is divided into anterior, long, and posterior segments. The authors hypothesized that right-handed patients with gliomas in the language-dominant (left) hemisphere would benefit from a more symmetrical or right-lateralized language pathway in terms of better preservation of language abilities. Furthermore, they investigated to what extent specific tumor characteristics, including proximity to the AF, affect language outcome in such patients.
METHODS Twenty-seven right-handed patients (12 males and 15 females; mean age 52 +- 16 years) with 11 low-grade and 16 high-grade gliomas of the left hemisphere underwent 3-T diffusion-weighted MRI (30 directions) and language assessment as part of presurgical planning. For a systematic quantitative evaluation of the AF, probabilistic fiber tracking with a 2 regions of interest approach was carried out. Volumes of the 3 segments of both hemispheric AFs were evaluated by quantifying normalized and thresholded pathways. Resulting values served to generate the laterality index of the AFs.; RESULTS Patients without language deficits tended to have an AF that was symmetric or lateralized to the right, whereas patients with deficits in language significantly more often demonstrated a left-lateralized posterior segment of the AF. Patients with high-grade gliomas had more severe language deficits than those with low-grade gliomas. Backward logistic regression revealed the laterality index of the posterior AF segment and tumor grade as the only independent statistically significant predictors for language deficits in this cohort.; CONCLUSIONS In addition to the well-known fact that tumor entity influences behavioral outcome, the authors' findings suggest that the right homologs of structural language-associated pathways could be supportive for language function and facilitate compensation mechanisms after brain damage in functionally eloquent areas. This further indicates that knowledge about preoperative functional redistribution (identified by neurofunctional imaging) increases the chance for total or near-total resections of tumors in eloquent areas. In the future, longitudinal studies with larger groups are mandatory to overcome the methodological limitations of this cross-sectional study and to map neuroplastic changes associated with language performance and rehabilitation in brain tumor patients.

T2  -  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY

N2  -  Thermal ablation techniques such as radiofrequency, microwave, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and laser have been used as minimally invasive strategies for the treatment of variety of cancers. MR thermometry methods are readily available for monitoring thermal distribution and deposition in real time, leading to decrease of incidents of normal tissue damage around targeted lesion. HIFU and laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) are the two widely accepted tumor ablation techniques because of their compatibility with MR systems. MRI provides multiple temperature dependent parameters for thermal imaging, such as signal intensity, T1, T2, diffusion coefficient, magnetization transfer, proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS, including phase imaging and spectroscopy) as well as frequency shift of temperature sensitive contrast agents. Absolute temperature mapping techniques, including both spectroscopic imaging using metabolites as a reference and phase imaging using fat as a reference, are immune to susceptibility effects and are not dependent on phase differences. These techniques are intrinsically more reliable than relative temperature measurement by phase mapping methods. If the limitation of low temporal and spatial resolution could be overcome, these methods may be preferred for MR-guided thermal ablation systems. As of today, the most popular MR thermal imaging method applied in tumor thermal ablation surgery is, however, still PRFS based phase mapping technique, which only provides relative temperature change and is prone to motion artifacts.

N2  -  Inter-individual heterogeneity of tumors leads to non-effectiveness of unique therapy plans. This issue has caused a growing interest in the field of personalized medicine and its application in tumor growth evaluation. Accordingly, in this paper, a framework of personalized medicine is presented for growth prediction of brain glioma tumors. A convection-diffusion-reaction model is used as the patient-specific tumor growth model which is associated with multimodal magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Two parameters of intracellular area fraction (ICAF) and metabolic rate have been used to incorporate the physiological data obtained from medical images into the model. The framework is tested on the data of two cases of glioma tumors to document the approach; parameter estimation is made using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) and the model is evaluated by comparing the predicted tumors with the observed tumors in terms of root mean square error of the ICAF maps (IRMSE), relative area difference (RAD) and Dice's coefficient (DC). Results show the differences of IRMSE, RAD and DC in 4.1 -/+ 1.15%, 0.099 -/+ 0.041 and 85.5 -/+ 7.5%, respectively. Survival times are estimated by assuming the tumor radius of 35 mm as the fatal burden. Results confirm that less-diffusive tumors lead to higher survival times. The represented framework makes it possible to personally predict the growth behavior of glioma tumors only based on patients' routine MRIs and provides a basis for modeling the personalized therapy and walking in the path of personalized medicine.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has had widespread use clinically in a variety of intracranial diseases; however, only a few studies report ADC changes in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. We sought to determine the ability of ADC to lateralize the epileptogenic lesion in patients with hippocampal sclerosis.
METHODS: Nineteen healthy volunteers and 18 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy whose MR imaging diagnosis was unilateral hippocampal sclerosis were examined prospectively with DW imaging and ADC mapping. DW images were obtained at 1.5 T with a spin-echo echo-planar sequence (6500103 TRTE) with variable diffusion gradients. ADCs were calculated from bilateral hippocampi. The ability of DW imaging and ADC to lateralize the lesion was evaluated visually and by comparing ADC values between healthy volunteers and patients with hippocampal sclerosis.; RESULTS: In all patients, visual assessment of DW images failed to lateralize the lesion. However, the mean ADC value measured at the hippocampal area was significantly higher on the lesion side than on the contralateral side (P < .001). The overall correct lateralization rate of ADC was 100% (18 of 18 patients). Mean ADC in sclerotic hippocampi was also significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. The normal-appearing hippocampus of the contralateral side in the patients had higher ADC values compared with those of healthy volunteers (P = .045).; CONCLUSION: ADC can be used as a complementary tool in lateralizing the epileptogenic lesion in patients with hippocampal sclerosis, although the practical role of ADC value is yet to be determined in patients with inconclusive MR imaging findings.

N2  -  Diffusion-tensor-imaging fiber tractography enables interrogation of brain white matter tracts that subserve different functions. However, tract reconstruction can be labor and time intensive and can yield variable results that may reduce the power to link imaging abnormalities with disability. Automated segmentation of these tracts would help make tract-specific imaging clinically useful, but implementation of such segmentation is problematic in the presence of diseases that alter brain structure. In this work, we investigated an automated tract-probability-mapping scheme and applied it to multiple sclerosis, comparing the results to those derived from conventional tractography. We found that the automated method has consistently lower scan-rescan variability (typically 0.7-1.5% vs. up to 3% for conventional tractography) and avoids problems related to tractography failures within and around lesions. In the corpus callosum, optic radiation, and corticospinal tract, tract-specific MRI indices calculated by the two methods were moderately to strongly correlated, though systematic, tract-specific differences were present. In these tracts, the two methods also yielded similar correlation coefficients relating tract-specific MRI indices to clinical disability scores. In the optic tract, the automated method failed. With judicious application, therefore, the automated method may be useful for studies that investigate the relationship between imaging findings and clinical outcomes in disease.

N2  -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive brain disease where lymphocytes invade along perivascular spaces of arteries and veins. The invasion markedly changes (peri)vascular structures but its effect on physiological brain pulsations has not been previously studied. Using physiological magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG(BOLD)) scanning, this study aims to quantify the extent to which (peri)vascular PCNSL involvement alters the stability of physiological brain pulsations mediated by cerebral vasculature. Clinical implications and relevance were explored. In this study, 21 PCNSL patients (median 67y; 38% females) and 30 healthy age-matched controls (median 63y; 73% females) were scanned for MREG(BOLD) signal during 2018-2021. Motion effects were removed. Voxel-by-voxel Coefficient of Variation (CV) maps of MREG(BOLD) signal was calculated to examine the stability of physiological brain pulsations. Group-level differences in CV were examined using nonparametric covariate-adjusted tests. Subject-level CV alterations were examined against control population Z-score maps wherein clusters of increased CV values were detected. Spatial distributions of clusters and findings from routine clinical neuroimaging were compared [contrast-enhanced, diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) data]. Whole-brain mean CV was linked to short-term mortality with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, as all deceased patients revealed higher values (n = 5, median 0.055) than surviving patients (n = 16, median 0.028) (p < .0001). After adjusting for medication, head motion, and age, patients revealed higher CV values (group median 0.035) than healthy controls (group median 0.024) around arterial territories (p <= .001). Abnormal clusters (median 1.10 x 10(5)mm(3)) extended spatially beyond FLAIR lesions (median 0.62 x 10(5)mm(3)) with differences in volumes (p = .0055).

N2  -  Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) may harbor malignant foci, which are characterized by increased tumor cellularity and angiogenesis. We used diffusion-weighted MR imaging (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) and PET with the amino acid O-(2-F-18-fluorethyl)-L-tyrosine (F-18-FET) to search for focal changes of diffusion (ADC) and amino acid uptake and to investigate whether focal changes in these parameters colocalize within LGGs. Methods: We retrospectively selected 18 patients with nonenhancing LGG. All patients had undergone (FFET)-F-18 PET and MR imaging for preoperative evaluation or for therapy monitoring in recurrent or progressive LGG. Region-of-interest analysis was performed to compare F-18-FET uptake and ADC values in areas with focal intratumoralmaximummetabolic activity and diffusion restriction and between tumor and normal brain. F-18-FET uptake was normalized to themean cerebellar uptake (ratio). ADCvalueswere also compared with the F-18-FET uptake on a voxel-by-voxel basis across thewhole tumor. Results: Themean focal maximum (mean +/- SD, 1.69 +/- 0.85) and global F-18-FET uptake in tumors (1.14 +/- 0.41) exceeded that of normal cortex (0.85 +/- 0.09) andcerebrospinal fluid (0.82 +/- 0.20). ADC values in the area with most restricted diffusion (1.07 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and in the whole tumor (1.38 +/- 0.27 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) were in the range between normal cortex (0.73 +/- 0.06 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and cerebrospinal fluid (2.84 +/- 0.09 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s). F-18-FET uptake did not correlate with corresponding (colocalizing) ADC values, either in the area with focal maximum metabolic activity or in the area with most restricted diffusion or in the whole tumor. Conclusion: There is no congruency between F-18-FET uptake and diffusivity in nonenhancing LGG. Diffusion restriction in these tumorsmost likely represents changes in brain and tumor cell densities as well as alteration ofwater distribution and is probably not directly correlated with the density of tumor cells.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As is the case for CT scans, MR images may occasionally appear deceptively normal unless proper windowing is used. We sought to illustrate the necessity for proper windowing and for assessing the gray-white matter differentiation on diffusion-weighted (DW) images in the setting of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
METHODS: Six comatose patients (age range, 34-56 years) underwent MR imaging in the early phase (range, 1-5 days) after severe anoxic insult. T2-weighted, turbo fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery, and DW images were obtained in all six patients, with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images obtained in four and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in five of the six patients.; RESULTS: At presentation, each of the six patients had symmetric, uniform hyperintensity in the cortex (mean ADC, 0.35 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) relative to the white matter (mean ADC, 0.91 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) on DW images. Each also had a poor outcome: brain death in four patients and a permanent vegetative state in two patients.; CONCLUSION: The appearance of the MR images in the setting of diffuse cortical laminar necrosis can be deceptive to the unwary radiologist. The key to correct interpretation is proper windowing and the marked gray-white matter differentiation on spin-echo images but best seen on properly windowed DW images in the early subacute phase. This appearance also implies an extremely poor outcome, either a permanent vegetative state or brain death.

N2  -  The accurate diagnosis of glioma subtypes is critical for appropriate treatment, but conventional histopathologic diagnosis often exhibits significant intra-observer variability and sampling error. The aim of this study was to investigate whether histogram analysis using an automatically segmented region of interest (ROI), excluding cystic or necrotic portions, could improve the differentiation between low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Thirty-two patients (nine low-grade and 23 high-grade gliomas) were included in this retrospective investigation. The outer boundaries of the entire tumors were manually drawn in each section of the contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted MR images. We excluded cystic or necrotic portions from the entire tumor volume. The histogram analyses were performed within the ROI on normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. To evaluate the contribution of the proposed method to glioma grading, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We found that an ROI excluding cystic or necrotic portions was more useful for glioma grading than was an entire tumor ROI. In the case of the fifth percentile values of the normalized ADC histogram, the area under the ROC curve for the tumor ROIs excluding cystic or necrotic portions was significantly higher than that for the entire tumor ROIs (p<0.005). The automatic segmentation of a cystic or necrotic area probably improves the ability to differentiate between high-and low-grade gliomas on an ADC map. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Objective: To determine the frequency of causes of space occupying lesions of brain in patients admitted in Neurosurgery ward PUMHS Nawabshah over a period of one year
Methodology: This descriptive case-series study took place at department of Neurosurgery of Peoples University of Medical and Health Sciences, for Women Shaheed Benazirabad. Study duration was one year from July 2019 to June 2020. All the patients with space-occupying lesion of brain either of gender were enrolled in this study. All study subjects were assessed for the causes of space-occupying lesion. Data was collected vis study proforma and analysis of the data was done by using SPSS version 20.; Results: A total of 80 patients were selected, their mean age was 31.76 years and females were in majority 66%, with female to male ratio of 1.96:1. Glioma was found in 23% cases which was highest among all type of lesion followed by abscess 10%. Supratentorial was observed in 73% patients which was highest among all site of lesion followed by third ventricular & Infratentorial 10% each.; Conclusion: The increased prevalence of infectious lesions can be linked to our population's low socioeconomic level and inadequate hygienic conditions. The rate of metastasis was found to be lower than previously reported. This might be attributed to cases not being referred following a metastatic lesion has been diagnosed. For early detection of brain tumours, advanced diagnostic equipment such as CT scans and MRI are desirable.

N2  -  Despite major advances in prevention, ischaemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. After centuries of nihilism and decades of failed neuroprotection trials, the discovery, initially in non-human primates and subsequently in man, that ischaemic brain tissue termed the ischaemic penumbra can be salvaged from infarction up to and perhaps beyond 24 h after stroke onset has underpinned the development of highly efficient reperfusion therapies, namely intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, which have revolutionized the management of the acute stroke patient. Animal experiments have documented that how long the penumbra can survive depends not only on time elapsed since arterial occlusion ('time is brain'), but also on how severely perfusion is reduced. Novel imaging techniques allowing the penumbra and the already irreversibly damaged core in the individual subject to be mapped have documented that the time course of core growth at the expense of the penumbra widely differs from patient to patient, and hence that individual physiology should be considered in addition to time since stroke onset for decision-making. This concept has been implemented to optimize patient selection in pivotal trials of reperfusion therapies beyond 3 h after stroke onset and is now routinely applied in clinical practice, using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The notion that, in order to be both efficient and harmless, treatment should be tailored to each patient's physiological characteristics represents a radical move towards precision medicine.

N2  -  Background: Tractography has become a standard tool for planning neurosurgical operations and has been proven to be useful for risk stratification. In various conditions, tractography-derived white matter integrity has been shown to be associated with neurological outcome. Postoperative performance has been shown to be a prognostic marker in glioma. We aimed to assess the relation of preoperative corticospinal tract (CST) integrity with postoperative neurological deterioration in patients with malignant glioma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 24 right-handed patients (41.7% female) for perioperative neurological performance score (NPS) and applied our anatomical tractography workflow to extract the median fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CST in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Median FA of the CST ipsilateral to the tumor correlated significantly with preoperative NPS (p = 0.025). After rank order correlation and multivariate linear regression, we found that the preoperative median FA of the right CST correlates with preoperative NPS, independently from epidemiological data (p = 0.019). In patients with lesions of the right hemisphere, median FA of the right CST was associated with a declining NPS in multivariate linear regression (p = 0.024). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an optimal FA cutoff at 0.3946 in this subgroup (area under the curve 0.83). Patients below that cutoff suffered from a decline in neurological performance significantly more often (p = 0.020). Conclusions: Assessment of preoperative white matter integrity may be a promising biomarker for risk estimation of patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of malignant glioma.

N2  -  Purpose of Review First, an anatomical and functional review of these cortical areas and subcortical connections with T-fMRI and tractography techniques; second, to demonstrate the value of this approach in neurosurgical planning in a series of patients with tumors close to the SMA. Recent Findings Implications in language and cognitive networks with a clear hemispheric lateralization of these SMA/pre-SMA. The recommendation of the use of the advanced neuroimaging studies for surgical planning and preservation of these areas. The SMA/pre-SMA and their subcortical connections are functional areas to be taken into consideration in neurosurgical planning. These areas would be involved in the control/inhibition of movement, in verbal expression and fluency and in tasks of cognitive control capacity. Its preservation is key to the patient's postsurgical cognitive and functional evolution.

N2  -  Background: Classical Galactosemia (CG) is an inherited disorder of galactose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) enzyme resulting in neurocognitive complications. As in many Inborn Errors of Metabolism, the metabolic pathway of CG is well-defined, but the pathophysiology and high variability in clinical outcome are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate structural changes of the brain of CG patients on MRI and their association with clinical outcome.
Methods: In this prospective cohort study an MRI protocol was developed to evaluate gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume of the cerebrum and cerebellum, WM hyperintensity volume, WM microstructure and myelin content with the use of conventional MRI techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative T1 mapping. The association between several neuroimaging parameters and both neurological and intellectual outcome was investigated.; Results: Twenty-one patients with CG (median age 22 years, range 8-47) and 24 controls (median age 30, range 16-52) were included. Compared to controls, the WM of CG patients was lower in volume and the microstructure of WM was impaired both in the whole brain and corticospinal tract (CST) and the lower R1 values of WM, GM and the CST were indicative of less myelin. The volume of WM lesions were comparable between patients and controls. The 916 patients with a poor neurological outcome (defined as the presence of a tremor andor dystonia), demonstrated a lower WM volume, an impaired WM microstructure and lower R1 values of the WM indicative of less myelin content compared to 716 patients without movement disorders. In 1521 patients with a poor intellectual outcome (defined as an IQ < 85) both GM and WM were affected with a lower cerebral and cerebellar WM and GM volume compared to 621 patients with an IQ >= 85. Both the severity of the tremor (as indicated by the Tremor Rating Scale) and IQ (as continuous measure) were associated with several neuroimaging parameters such as GM volume, WM volume, CSF volume, WM microstructure parameters and R1 values of GM and WM.; Conclusion: In this explorative study performed in patients with Classical Galactosemia, not only WM but also GM pathology was found, with more severe brain abnormalities on MRI in patients with a poor neurological and intellectual outcome. The finding that structural changes of the brain were associated with the severity of long-term complications indicates that quantitative MRI techniques could be of use to explain neurological and cognitive dysfunction as part of the disease spectrum. Based on the clinical outcome of patients, the absence of widespread WM lesions and the finding that both GM and WM are affected, CG could be primarily a GM disease with secondary damage to the WM as a result of neuronal degeneration. To investigate this further the course of GM and WM should be evaluated in longitudinal research, which could also clarify if CG is a neurodegenerative disease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  A brain abscess is a focal accumulation of pus in the brain parenchyma arising from direct inoculation, contiguous spread from local anatomical structures or haematogenous seeding from a remote source of infection. It can result in significant morbidity and mortality, making early diagnosis and treatment vital. Only one fifth of patients present with the classic triad of headache, fever and focal neurological symptoms. More commonly patients show signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure alone, such as confusion or reduced conscious level, headache, nausea and vomiting, which can be a presentation of many intracranial pathologies. Distinguishing an abscess from other pathologies such as meningitis and tumours is crucial, as clinically these can present in similar ways, but their management and outcomes are very different. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scans can help localise the lesion and differentiate ring-enhancing lesions caused by a brain abscess from malignant tumours. Cerebral abscesses are considered a neurosurgical emergency; early stabilisation, diagnosis and management in a neurosurgical centre is important in reducing morbidity and mortality.

N2  -  Microscopic invasion of tumor cells and undetected tumor proliferation is the primary reason for a dismal prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Identification and quantification of spatially localized brain regions undergoing high rates of cell migration and proliferation is critical for improving patient survival; however, there are currently no non-invasive imaging biomarkers for estimating proliferation and migration rates of human gliomas in vivo. To accomplish this, we developed CIMPLE (cell invasion, motility, and proliferation level estimates) image maps using serial diffusion MRI scans and a solution to a glioma growth model equation. CIMPLE represent a novel method of quantifying the level of aggressive malignant behavior. In the current pilot study, we demonstrate the utility of CIMPLE maps to predict progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 26 recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab from our Neuro-Oncology database. Voxel-wise estimates of cell proliferation rate predicted spatial regions of contrast enhancement in 35% of patients. A linear correlation was found between the mean proliferation rate and progression-free survival (PFS; P < 0.0001) as well as overall survival (OS; P = 0.0093). Similarly, the mean proliferation rate was able to stratify patients with early and late PFS as well as OS.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The alteration of brain maturation in preterm infants contributes to neurodevelopmental disabilities during childhood. Serial imaging allows understanding of the mechanisms leading to dysmaturation in the preterm brain. The purpose of the present study was to provide reference quantitative MR imaging measures across time in preterm infants, by using ADC, fractional anisotropy, and T1 maps obtained by using the magnetization-prepared dual rapid acquisition of gradient echo technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included preterm neonates born at <30 weeks of gestational age without major brain lesions on early cranial sonography and performed 3 MRIs (3T) from birth to term-equivalent age. Multiple measurements (ADC, fractional anisotropy, and T1 relaxation) were performed on each examination in 12 defined white and gray matter ROIs.; RESULTS: We acquired 107 MRIs (35 early, 33 intermediary, and 39 at term-equivalent age) in 39 cerebral low-risk preterm infants. Measures of T1 relaxation time showed a gradual and significant decrease with time in a region- and hemispheric-specific manner. ADC values showed a similar decline with time, but with more variability than T1 relaxation. An increase of fractional anisotropy values was observed in WM regions and inversely a decrease in the cortex.; CONCLUSIONS: The gradual change with time reflects the progressive maturation of the cerebral microstructure in white and gray matter. Our study provides reference trajectories from 25 to 40 weeks of gestation of T1 relaxation, ADC, and fractional anisotropy values in low-risk preterm infants. We speculate that deviation thereof might reflect disturbed cerebral maturation; the correlation of this disturbed maturation with neurodevelopmental outcome remains to be addressed.

N2  -  Neuroimaging has played a critical role in the management of patients with neurological disease, since the first ventriculogram was performed in 1918 by Walter Dandy (Mezger et al. Langenbecks Arch Surg 398(4):501-514, 2013). Over the last century, technology has evolved significantly, and within the last decade, the role of imaging in the management of patients with neuro-oncologic disease has shifted from a tool for gross identification of intracranial pathology, to an integral part of real-time neurological surgery. Current neurological imaging provides detailed information about anatomical structure, neurological function, and metabolic and metabolism-important characteristics that help clinicians and surgeons non-invasively manage patients with brain tumors. It is valuable to review the evolution of neurological imaging over the past several decades, focusing on its role in the management of patients with intracranial tumors. Novel neuro-imaging tools and developing technology with the potential to further transform clinical practice will be discussed, as will the key role neurological imaging plays in neurosurgical planning and intraoperative navigation. With increasingly complex imaging modalities creating growing amounts of raw data, validation of techniques, data analysis, and integrating various pieces of imaging data into individual patient management plans, remain significant challenges for clinicians. We thus suggest mechanisms that might ultimately allow for evidence based integration of imaging in the management of patients with neuro-oncologic disease.

N2  -  Young children with brain tumors are often treated with high-dose chemotherapy after surgery to avoid brain tissue injury associated with irradiation. The effects of systemic chemotherapy on healthy brain tissue in this population, however, are unclear. Our objective was to compare gray and white matter integrity using MRI procedures in children with brain tumors (n = 7, mean age 8.3 years), treated with surgery and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell rescue (AuHCR) an average of 5.4 years earlier, to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9, mean age 9.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected to evaluate tissue integrity throughout the brain, as measured by mean diffusivity (MD), a marker of glial, neuronal, and axonal status, and fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of axonal health. Individual MD and FA maps were calculated, normalized, smoothed, and compared between groups using analysis of covariance, with age and sex as covariates. Higher MD values, indicative of injury, emerged in patients compared with controls (p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons), and were especially apparent in the central thalamus, external capsule, putamen, globus pallidus and pons. Reduced FA values in some regions did not reach significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Children treated with surgery and high-dose chemotherapy with AuHCR for brain tumors an average of 5.4 years earlier show alterations in white and gray matter in multiple brain areas distant from the tumor site, raising the possibility for long-term consequences of the tumor or treatment.

N2  -  PurposeWe investigated whether oscillating gradient diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide information on brain microstructural changes after formaldehyde fixation and after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury beyond that provided by conventional dMRI.
MethodsPulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) and oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) dMRI of the adult mouse brain was performed in vivo (50-200 Hz, b=600 mm(2)s), and a similar protocol was applied to neonatal mouse brains at 24 h after unilateral hypoxia-ischemia. Animals were perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for ex vivo dMRI and histology.; ResultsApparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) measured in the live adult mouse brain presented tissue-dependent frequency-dependence. In vivo OGSE-ADC maps at high oscillating frequencies (>100 Hz) showed clear contrast between the molecular layer and granule cell layer in the adult mouse cerebellum. Formaldehyde fixation significantly altered the temporal diffusion spectra in several brain regions. In neonatal mouse brains with HI injury, in vivo ADC measurements from edema regions showed diminished edema contrasts at 200 Hz compared with the PGSE results. Histology showed severe tissue swelling and necrosis in the edema regions.; ConclusionThe results demonstrate the unique ability of OGSE-dMRI in delineating tissue microstructures at different spatial scales.

N2  -  The concept of focusing high-intensity ultrasound beams for the purpose of cerebral ablation has interested neurosurgeons for more than 70 yr. However, the need for a craniectomy or a cranial acoustic window hindered the clinical diffusion of this technique. Recent technological advances, including the development of phased-array transducers and magnetic resonance imaging technology, have rekindled the interest in ultrasound for ablative brain surgery and have led to the development of the transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thermal ablation procedure. In the last decade, this method has become increasingly popular, and its clinical applications are broadening. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of MRgFUS, transcranial thermal ablation using ultrasound is limited in that it can target exclusively the central region of the brain where the multiple acoustic beams are most optimally focused. On the contrary, lesioning of the cortex, the superficial subcortical areas, and regions close to the skull base is not possible with the limited treatment envelope of current phased-array transducers. Therefore, new ultrasound ablative techniques, which are not based on thermal mechanisms, have been developed and tested in experimental settings. This review describes the mechanisms by which these novel, nonthermal ablative techniques are based and also presents the current clinical applications of MRgFUS thermal ablation.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives. To compare low-field with high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in respect to setup, workflow, and efficiency.
Materials and Methods. A total of 750 patients were investigated either with a 0.2 T (March 1996-July 2001) or a 1.5 T (April 2002-August 2004) MRI system adapted for intraoperative use.; Results. With the low-field setup, 330 patients were examined in 65 months; with the high-field setup, 420 patients were examined in 29 months, which is a 2.8-fold increase in cases per month (14.5 versus 5.1) reflecting improved ease of use. Concerning intraoperative workflow, the time for preparation to start intraoperative imaging decreased fivefold (2 minutes instead of 10 minutes); navigation was applied more often with 57% versus 51% (240420 versus 167330), whereas functional data were integrated in 35% versus 39% (84240 versus 65167). Application of navigation updates was doubled (22% versus 11%; 53240 versus 18167). Image acquisition time was reduced by a factor of two, allowing a more detailed imaging protocol, whereas the image quality is clearly improved in the high-field setup, where there was no difference between the standard preoperative image quality compared with the intraoperative quality. This contributed to an increased detection of tumor remnants and extended resections in pituitary (36% versus 29%; 47129 versus 1759) and glioma surgery (41% versus 26%; 3893 versus 28106).; Conclusion. Compared with the low-field setup, the high-field setup results not only in clearly superior image quality and increased imaging armamentarium, contributing to increased rates of detected tumor remnants, but also in a distinct improvement of intraoperative workflow. Furthermore, intraoperative high-field MRI offers various modalities beyond standard anatomic imaging, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI.

N2  -  Background Following chemoradiotherapy for high-grade glioma (HGG), it is often challenging to distinguish treatment changes from true tumor progression using conventional MRI. The diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) hindered fraction is associated with tissue edema or necrosis, which are common treatment-related changes. We hypothesized that DBSI hindered fraction may augment conventional imaging for earlier diagnosis of progression versus treatment effect. Methods Adult patients were prospectively recruited if they had a known histologic diagnosis of HGG and completed standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy. DBSI and conventional MRI data were acquired longitudinally beginning 4 weeks post-radiation. Conventional MRI and DBSI metrics were compared with respect to their ability to diagnose progression versus treatment effect. Results Twelve HGG patients were enrolled between August 2019 and February 2020, and 9 were ultimately analyzed (5 progression, 4 treatment effect). Within new or enlarging contrast-enhancing regions, DBSI hindered fraction was significantly higher in the treatment effect group compared to progression group (P = .0004). Compared to serial conventional MRI alone, inclusion of DBSI would have led to earlier diagnosis of either progression or treatment effect in 6 (66.7%) patients by a median of 7.7 (interquartile range = 0-20.1) weeks. Conclusions In the first longitudinal prospective study of DBSI in adult HGG patients, we found that in new or enlarging contrast-enhancing regions following therapy, DBSI hindered fraction is elevated in cases of treatment effect compared to those with progression. Hindered fraction map may be a valuable adjunct to conventional MRI to distinguish tumor progression from treatment effect.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate whether oligodendroglial tumors With or without 1p/19q loss differ in their diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics. Oligodendroglial tumors with or without 1p/19q loss differ in their therapeutic responsiveness and prognosis, and recent reports also suggest that these tumors may differ in their magnetic resonance characteristics and blood volume.
Materials and Methods: Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were assessed in three grade II oligodendrogliomas, nine grade II and five, grade III oligoastrocytomas with known 1p19q status. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on ADC maps: 1) around tumor margins to generate pixel histograms; 2) over minimum and maximum tumor ADC; 3) on areas comparable to the highest choline (Cho)creatine (Cr) ratio determined from chemical shift imaging (CSI): and 4) across tumor margins to measure the ADC transition coefficient (ATC).; Results: Tumor ADC was significantly different from normal brain (P < 0.001). ADC in regions of highest ChoCr was greater than minimum ADC and did not correlate with the ChoCr ratio. ADC-and ATC were not significantly different between oligodendroglial subtypes or grades. Tumors with intact 1p 19q had higher maximum (P = 0.021) and histogram ADC (P = 0.015), and greater ATC (P = 0.001) compared to those with 1p19q loss, which may reflect differences in edema and cellularity.; Conclusion: This preliminary study, identified differences in ADC and ATC. between oligodendroglial tumor genotypes that may reflect underlying biology. Confirmation in a larger series is warranted.

N2  -  Backround: Less than 1% of all intracranial tumors are in the pineal region. Papillary tumor of the pineal region is considered one of four pineal parenchymal tumors according to the 2007 World Health Organisation classification of central nervous system tumors. It is mostly seen in the middle age and it is rare under the age of 17 in the literature. In this report, we aim to present a case with papillary tumor of the pineal region with both CT and MRI findings, and discuss the differential diagnosis.
Case report: A 17-year-old female patient who underwent a treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus 18 months ago applied to the neurosurgery clinic with nausea, vomiting, sensorineural hearing loss and Parinaud syndrome continuing through 1 month. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been applied. A 58x31x38 mm mass with cystic and mild hyperdense soft tissue components was observed in the localization of pineal gland and posterior comissure on non-enhanced CT. MRI examination revealed that the mass filled the pineal region, contained solid and large cystic components, and hyperintense on T1-weighted images. After intravenous contrast media injection, the mass enhanced more peripherally. DW MRI showed that there is a diffusion restriction in some parts of the soft tissue components. The mass was totally resected, and pathology report revealed that it is a papillary tumor of the pineal region.; Conclusion: When a T1-weighted hyperintense and CT hyperdense mass with cystic and solid components is seen in the pineal region, even if it is rare, papillary tumor should also be considered in the differential diagnosis after exclusion of other hyperintense lesions in T1-weighted imaging.

N2  -  Objectives: To determine whether small diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions occur beyond the acute posthemorrhage time window in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to characterize their spatial distribution in patients with lobar and deep cerebral hemorrhages.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively analyzed 458 MRI scans obtained in the acute (<7 days after ICH) or nonacute (>14 days after ICH) phases from 392 subjects with strictly lobar (n = 276) and deep (n = 116) ICH (48.7% women; mean age 72.8 +- 11.7 years). DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and T2* MRIs were reviewed for the presence and location of DWI lesions.; Results: We identified 103 DWI hyperintense lesions on scans from 62 subjects, located mostly in lobar brain regions (90 of 103, 87.4%). The lesions were not uniformly distributed throughout the brain lobes; patients with strictly lobar ICH had relative overrepresentation of lesions in frontal lobe, and patients with deep ICH in parietal lobe (p = 0.002). Although the frequency of DWI lesions tended to be greater on scans performed within 7 days after ICH (39 of 214, 18.2%), they continued at high frequency in the nonacute period as well (23 of 178, 12.9%, odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.86-2.6 for acute vs nonacute). There was also no difference in frequency of lesions on acute and nonacute scans among 66 subjects with MRIs in both time periods (8 of 66 acute, 10 of 66 nonacute, odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.25-2.4).; Conclusions: The high frequency of DWI lesions beyond the acute post-ICH period and their characteristic distributions suggest that they are products of the small vessel diseases that underlie ICH.

N2  -  A 59-year-old immunocompetent man was admitted to our hospital because of progressive dementia with concomitant bilateral uveitis. The first brain MRI revealed diffuse hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter of both hemispheres on a T2-weighted image and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image. However, another MRI taken more than 1 month later revealed enhanced cohesive mass lesions in the bilateral thalami, in addition to the white matter lesions. The white matter lesions were slightly hyperintense on a diffusion-weighted image and apparent diffusion coefficient map image, suggesting vasogenic edema. One year after the onset of uveitis, he died of respiratory failure. Pathological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with perivascular proliferation and diffuse scattered infiltration in the cerebrum and brainstem. Microscopically, cohesive mass lesions in the bilateral thalami were a massive cluster of lymphoma cells. This is a case of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) mimicking 'lymphomatosis cerebri (LC)' at first but later exhibiting typical mass lesions, giving rise to the possibility that cases of LC might unmask features of regular lymphomas in their later course more often than believed thus far.

N2  -  Although advances in diffusion tensor imaging have enabled us to better study the anatomy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), its function remains poorly understood. Recently, it was suggested that the subcortical network subserving the language semantics could be constituted, in parallel with the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, by the left ILF, joining the posterior occipitotemporal regions to the temporal pole, then relayed by the uncinate fasciculus connecting the anterior temporal pole to the frontobasal areas. Nevertheless, this hypothesis was solely based on neurofunctional imaging, allowing a cortical mapping but with no anatomofunctional information regarding the white matter. Here, we report a series of 12 patients operated on under local anaesthesia for a cerebral low-grade glioma located within the left temporal lobe. Before and during resection, we used the method of intraoperative direct electrostimulation, enabling us to perform accurate and reliable anatomofunctional correlations both at cortical and subcortical levels. In order to map the ILF. Using postoperative MRI, we correlated these functional findings with the anatomical locations of the sites where language disturbances were elicited by stimulations, both at cortical and subcortical levels. Our goal was to study the potential existence of parallel and distributed language networks crossing the left dominant temporal lobe, sub-served by distinct subcortical pathways namely the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the ILF. Intraoperative stimulation of the anterior and middle temporal cortex elicited anomia in four patients. At the subcortical level, semantic paraphasia were induced in seven patients during stimulation of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and phonological paraphasia was generated in seven patients by stimulating the arcuate fasciculus. Interestingly, subcortical stimulation never elicited any language disturbances when performed at the level of the ILF. In addition, following a transient postoperative language deficit, all patients recovered, despite the resection of at least one part of the ILF, as confirmed by control MRI. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the "semantic ventral stream" could be constituted by at least two parallel pathways within the left dominant temporal lobe: (i) a direct pathway, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, that connects the posterior temporal areas and the orbitofrontal region, crucial for language semantic processing, since it elicits semantic paraphasia when stimulated; (ii) and also possibly an indirect pathway subserved by the ILF, not indispensable for language, since it can be compensated both during stimulation and after resection.

N2  -  Background: The inter-individual variability of behavioral effects after tDCS applied to the unaffected right hemisphere in stroke may be related to factors such as the lesion location.
Objectivehypothesis: We investigated the effect of left Broca's area (BA) damage on picture naming in aphasic patients after cathodal tDCS applied over the right BA.; Methods: We conducted a study using pre-interventional diffusion and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and two cross-over tDCS sessions (TYPE: sham and cathodal) over the right homologous BA in aphasic stroke patients with ischemic lesions involving the left BA (BA+) or other left brain areas (BA-). Picture naming accuracy was assessed after each session. Inter-hemispheric (IH) functional balance was investigated via rsfMRI connectivity maps using the right BA as a seed. Probabilistic tractography was used to study the integrity of language white matter pathways.; Results: tDCS had different effects on picture naming accuracy in BA+ and BA- patients (TYPE x GROUP interaction, F(1,19): 4.6, P: 0.04). All BA- patients except one did not respond to tDCS and demonstrated normal IH balance between the right and left BA when compared to healthy subjects. BA+ patients were improved by tDCS in 36% and had decreased level of functional IH balance. Improvement in picture naming after cathodal tDCS was associated with the integrity of the arcuate fasciculus in BA+ patients.; Conclusions: Behavioral effects of cathodal tDCS on the unaffected right hemisphere differ depending on whether BA and the arcuate fasciculus are damaged. Therefore, IH imbalance could be a direct consequence of anatomical lesions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background Survival outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM) patients remain unfavorable, and tumor recurrence is often observed. Understanding the radiological growth patterns of GBM could aid in improving outcomes. This study aimed to examine the relationship between contrast-enhancing tumor growth direction and white matter, using an image registration and deformation strategy.Methods In GBM patients 2 pretreatment scans (diagnostic and neuronavigation) were gathered retrospectively, and coregistered to a template and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) atlas. The GBM lesions were segmented and coregistered to the same space. Growth vectors were derived and divided into vector populations parallel (Phi = 0-20 degrees) and perpendicular (Phi = 70-90 degrees) to white matter. To test for statistical significance between parallel and perpendicular groups, a paired samples Student's t-test was performed. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status and its correlation to growth rate were also tested using a one-way ANOVA test.Results For 78 GBM patients (mean age 61 years +/- 13 SD, 32 men), the included GBM lesions showed a predominant preference for perineural satellitosis (P < .001), with a mean percentile growth of 30.8% (95% CI: 29.6-32.0%) parallel (0 degrees < |Phi| < 20 degrees) to white matter. Perpendicular tumor growth with respect to white matter microstructure (70 degrees < |Phi| < 90 degrees) showed to be 22.7% (95% CI: 21.3-24.1%) of total tumor growth direction.Conclusions The presented strategy showed that tumor growth direction in pretreatment GBM patients correlated with white matter architecture. Future studies with patient-specific DTI data are required to verify the accuracy of this method prospectively to identify its usefulness as a clinical metric in pre and posttreatment settings.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will show abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) in the normal-appearing brain after prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). These abnormalities will be more accentuated in patients with underlying vascular risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study by use of DTI and conventional T2-weighted MR images was performed with a 1.5T unit with 16 patients with small cell lung cancer and undergoing PCI. All of the T2-weighted images were evaluated with respect to abnormalities in signal intensity of white matter as markers of radiation damage. Measurements of FA were performed before, at the end of, and 6 weeks after radiation therapy. On the FA maps, the bifrontal white matter, the corona radiata, the cerebellum, and the brain stem were evaluated. FA values were compared with respect to age, demographic, and vascular risk factors. Statistical-analyses (Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, and Mann-Whitney U test) were performed.; RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy decreased significantly in supratentorial and infratentorial normal-appearing white matter from the beginning to the end of PCI (P <.01). A further decline in FA occurred 6 weeks after irradiation (P <.05). A stronger reduction in FA was observed in patients with more than 1 vascular risk factor. There was an age-related reduction of white matter FA. Patients 65 years and older showed a trend toward a stronger reduction in FA.; CONCLUSION: During the acute phase, after PCI, patients with many vascular risk factors showed stronger damage in the white matter compared with patients with only 1 risk factor.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although utility of diffusion MR imaging in the preoperative diagnosis of common pediatric cerebellar tumors is generally recognized, its added value has not been systematically studied previously. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of diffusion MR imaging on the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of common pediatric cerebellar tumors among reviewers with different experience levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of the neuro-oncology data base yielded 96 patients whose preoperative brain MR imaging included both diffusion MR imaging (b = 1000 smm(2)) and ADC maps. There were 38 pilocytic astrocytomas, 33 medulloblastomas, 17 ependymomas, and 8 atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumors. Six reviewers (4 residents, 2 neuroradiologists) evaluated the examinations. Two sessions were conducted with each reviewer, without and with diffusion MR imaging data on 2 separate days. The impact of diffusion MR imaging on accuracy of diagnoses was assessed.; RESULTS: In choosing the correct diagnosis of the 4 alternatives, performances of 5 of the 6 reviewers improved significantly with inclusion of the diffusion MR imaging data, from 63%-77% (P = .0003-.0233). The performance of 1 reviewer also improved, but the difference did not attain statistical significance (P = .1944). Inclusion of diffusion MR imaging data improved the likelihood of rendering a correct diagnosis (odds ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 2.07-4.00) over all tumor types. When embryonal tumors were regarded as a single group, the rate of correct diagnosis increased from 66%-83% with diffusion MR imaging data, and performances of all of the reviewers improved significantly (P = .0001-.05). The improvement in performances resulted from increased correct diagnoses of pilocytic astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, and atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumors. There was no improvement in the correct diagnoses of ependymomas with inclusion of the diffusion MR imaging data.; CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion MR imaging improves accuracy of preoperative diagnosis of common pediatric cerebellar tumors significantly among reviewers with differing experience levels.

N2  -  Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is an important stroke subtype, but preclinical research is limited by a lack of translational animal models. Large animal models are useful to comparatively investigate key pathophysiological parameters in human ICH. To (i) establish an acute model of moderate ICH in adult sheep and (ii) an advanced neuroimage processing pipeline for automatic brain tissue and hemorrhagic lesion determination; 14 adult sheep were assigned for stereotactically induced ICH into cerebral white matter under physiological monitoring. Six hours after ICH neuroimaging using 1.5T MRI including structural as well as perfusion and diffusion, weighted imaging was performed before scarification and subsequent neuropathological investigation including immunohistological staining. Controlled, stereotactic application of autologous blood caused a space-occupying intracerebral hematoma of moderate severity, predominantly affecting white matter at 5 h post-injection. Neuroimage post-processing including lesion probability maps enabled automatic quantification of structural alterations including perilesional diffusion and perfusion restrictions. Neuropathological and immunohistological investigation confirmed perilesional vacuolation, axonal damage, and perivascular blood as seen after human ICH. The model and imaging platform reflects key aspects of human ICH and enables future translational research on hematoma expansion/evacuation, white matter changes, hematoma evacuation, and other aspects.

N2  -  The mammillary bodies as part of the hypothalamic nuclei are in the central limbic circuitry of the human brain. The mammillary bodies are shown to be directly or indirectly connected to the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalami as the major gray matter structures of the human limbic system. Although it is not primarily considered as part of the human limbic system, the thalamus is shown to be involved in many limbic functions of the human brain. The major direct connection of the thalami with the hypothalamic nuclei is known to be through the mammillothalamic tract. Given the crucial role of the mammillothalamic tracts in memory functions, diffusion tensor imaging may be helpful in better visualizing the surgical anatomy of this pathway noninvasively. This study aimed to investigate the utility of high spatial resolution diffusion tensor tractography for mapping the trajectory of the mammillothalamic tract in the human brain. Fifteen healthy adults were studied after obtaining written informed consent. We used high spatial resolution diffusion tensor imaging data at 3.0T. We delineated, for the first time, the detailed trajectory of the mammillothalamic tract of the human brain using deterministic diffusion tensor tractography.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the contribution of perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI) by using the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratio in the differential diagnosis of various intracranial space-occupying lesions.
Materials and Methods: This study involved 105 patients with lesions (high-grade glioma (N = 26), low-grade glioma (N= 11), meningioma (N = 23), metastasis (N 25), hemangioblastoma (N = 6), pyogenic abscess (N 4), schwannoma (N = 5), and lymphoma. (N = 5)). The patients were examined with a T2*-weighted (T2*W) gradient-echo singleshot EPI sequence. The rCBV ratios of the lesions were obtained by dividing the values obtained from the normal white matter. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.; Results: The rCBV ratio was 5.76 +- 3.35 in high-grade gliomas, 1.69 +- 0.51 in low-grade gliomas, 8.02 +- 3.89 in meningiomas, 5.27 +- 3.22 in metastases, 11.36 +- 4.41 in hemangioblastomas, 0.76 +- 0.12 in abscesses, 1.10 +- 0.32 in lymphomas, and 3.23 +- 0.81 in schwannomas. The rCBV ratios were used to discriminate between 1) high- and low-grade gliomas (P < 0.00 1), 2) hemangioblastomas and metastases (P < 0.05), 3) abscesses from high-grade gliomas and metastases (P < 0.001), 4) schwannomas and meningiomas (P < 0.001), 5) lymphomas from high-grade gliomas and metastases (P < 0.001), and 6) typical meningiomas and atypical meningiomas (P < 0.01).; Conclusion: rCBV ratios can help discriminate intracranial space-occupying lesions by demonstrating lesion vascularity. It is possible to discriminate between 1) high- and low-grade gliomas, 2) hemangioblastomas and other intracranial posterior fossa masses, 3) abscesses from highgrade gliomas and metastases, 4) schwannomas and meningiomas, 5) lymphomas and high-grade gliomas and metastases, and 6) typical and atypical meningiomas.

N2  -  Recent investigations on transient focal cerebral ischemia suggested recovery of energy metabolism during early reperfusion, but followed by secondary energy failure. As disturbances of energy metabolism are reflected by changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water, the aim of the current study was to follow the dynamics of the ADC during 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 10 hours of reperfusion. The right MCA was occluded in male Wistar rats inside the magnet using a remotely controlled thread occlusion model. Diffusion-, perfusion-, and T-2- weighted images were performed repetitively, and ADC, perfusion, and T-2 maps were calculated and normalized to the respective preischemic value. The lesion volume at each time point was defined by ADC < 80% of control. At the end of 1-hour MCAO the hemispheric lesion volume was 22.3 +/- 9.0%: it decreased to 6.4 +/- 5.7% in the first 2 hours of reperfusion (P < 0.01), but then increased again, and by the end of 10 hours of reperfusion reached 17.3 +/- 9.3%. The mean relative ADC in the end ischemic lesion volume significantly improved within 2 hours of reperfusion (From 65.7 +/- 1.2% to 90.1 +/- 6.7% of control), but later declined and decreased to 75.4 +/- 7.3% of control by the end of the experiment. Pixels with secondary deterioration of ADC showed a continuous increase of T-2 value during the first 2 hours of reperfusion in spite of ADC improvement, indicating improving cytotoxic, but generation of vasogenic edema during early reperfusion. A significant decrease of the perfusion level was not observed during 10 hours of recirculation. The authors conclude that the improvement of ADC in the early phase of reperfusion may be followed by secondary deterioration that was not caused by delayed hypoperfusion.

N2  -  The effectiveness of correcting diffusion Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) distortion and its impact on tractography reconstruction have not been adequately investigated in the intraoperative MRI setting, particularly for High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) acquisition. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of EPI distortion correction using 27 legacy intraoperative HARDI datasets over two consecutive surgical time points, acquired without reverse phase-encoded data, from 17 children who underwent epilepsy surgery at our institution. The data was processed with EPI distortion correction using the Synb0-Disco technique (Schilling et al., 2019) and without distortion correction. The corrected and uncorrected b0 diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were first compared visually. The mutual information indices between the original T1-weighted images and the fractional anisotropy images derived from corrected and uncorrected DWI were used to quantify the effect of distortion correction. Sixty-four white matter tracts were segmented from each dataset, using a deep-learning based automated tractography algorithm for the purpose of a standardized and unbiased evaluation. Displacement was calculated between tracts generated before and after distortion correction. The tracts were grouped based on their principal morphological orientations to investigate whether the effects of EPI distortion vary with tract orientation. Group differences in tract distortion were investigated both globally, and regionally with respect to proximity to the resecting lesion in the operative hemisphere. Qualitatively, we observed notable improvement in the corrected diffusion images, over the typically affected brain regions near skull-base air sinuses, and correction of additional distortion unique to intraoperative open cranium images, particularly over the resection site. This improvement was supported quantitatively, as mutual information indices between the FA and T1-weighted images were significantly greater after the correction, compared to before the correction. Maximum tract displacement between the corrected and uncorrected data, was in the range of 7.5 to 10.0 mm, a magnitude that would challenge the safety resection margin typically tolerated for tractography-informed surgical guidance. This was particularly relevant for tracts oriented partially or fully in-line with the acquired diffusion phase-encoded direction. Portions of these tracts passing close to the resection site demonstrated significantly greater magnitude of displacement, compared to portions of tracts remote from the resection site in the operative hemisphere. Our findings have direct clinical implication on the accuracy of intraoperative tractography-informed image guidance and emphasize the need to develop a distortion correction technique with feasible intraoperative processing time.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - To investigate whether neuroimaging information has added predictive value compared with clinical information for independency in activities of daily living (ADL) 1 year after stroke.
Methods - Seventy-five first-ever middle cerebral artery stroke survivors were evaluated in logistic regression analyses. Model 1 was derived on the basis of clinical variables; for model 2, neuroimaging variables were added to model 1. Independent variables were stroke severity ( National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), consciousness ( Glasgow Coma Scale), urinary continence, demographic variables ( age, gender, relationship, educational level), hospital of admission, and clinical instruments: sitting balance ( trunk control test), motor functioning (Motricity Index), and ADL (Barthel Index). Neuroimaging variables, determined on conventional MRI scans, included: number of days to scanning, lesion volume, lesion localization (cortexsubcortex), hemisphere, and the presence of white matter lesions. ADL independency was defined as 19 and 20 points on Barthel Index. Differences in accuracy of prediction of ADL independence between models 1 and 2 were analyzed by comparing areas under the curve (AUC) in a receiver operating characteristic analysis.; Results - Model 1 contained as significant predictors: age and ADL ( AUC 0.84), correctly predicting 77%. In model 2, number of days to scanning, hemisphere, and lesion volume were added to model 1, increasing the AUC from 0.84 to 0.87, accurately predicting 83% of the surviving patients.; Conclusions - Clinical variables in the second week after stroke are good predictors for independency in ADL 1 year after stroke. Neuroimaging variables on conventional MRI scans do not have added value in long-term prediction of ADL.

N2  -  Morbidity attributable to hypoxic-ischaemic injury (HIE) in the perinatal period remains problematic, and timely and accurate assessment of the degree of injury is required for clinical management and prognosis. Conventional MR sequences typically appear normal in the first 48 h post HIE. While diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps register the injury earlier, perhaps within the first 24 h, it has been suggested that there may be a propensity at that early stage to underestimate the lesion severity or extent.
To assess whether MR imaging that included DWI, measured ADC values and T1- and T2-weighted sequences ultimately correlated with either neurodevelopmental outcome or with late MR imaging at 2 years of age. In addition, we wished to compare the performance of MR imaging with cranial US imaging.; All infants presenting with HIE who had an MRI within 10 days of life were eligible for enrollment and subsequently underwent a full neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age. All children underwent repeat MRI at this time. All neonates had at least one cranial US study. The US findings were categorized as normal, abnormalities confined to the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter, isolated central grey matter hyperechogenicity, and central hyperechogenicity combined with cerebral corticalsubcortical changes. All MRI studies were retrospectively reviewed by three radiologists. The patterns of injury on the early DWI and ADC maps and early T1- and T2-W studies were recorded as diffuse, central, watershed or atypical. The patterns of signal abnormality were assessed using a scoring system that yielded four separate scores basal ganglia (BG), watershed (W), BGW and summation (S) for the three sets of images, a total of 12 scores in all. The appearance of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) on T1-W inversion recovery sequences and of the corpus callosum on all sequences was also documented. After detailed neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age, infants were classified into two groups according to whether they had a favourable or unfavourable outcome.; Of the 26 infants, 6 infants died before formal assessment at the age of 2 years. A further 5 infants had moderate to severe cerebral palsy in addition to severe cognitive impairment. The remaining 15 infants were categorized in the favourable outcome group. The US appearance performed well in terms of predicting final outcome (P = 0.005). The pattern of ischaemia seen on early MRI was a significant predictor of outcome (P < 0.0001). The BG, BGW and S scores of the diffusion imaging were significantly associated with outcome (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0005 respectively). DWI was predictive of outcome group (P < 0.0001), as were the early T1- and T2-W sequences (P = 0.002) and cranial US (P = 0.005). Assessment of the PLIC in infants with watershed or atypical patterns of ischaemia was found to be less reliable in predicting outcome. The measured ADC value in the PLIC was significantly reduced in those children who had an unfavourable outcome (P = 0.03).; While early MRI performed better than cranial US, the sonography findings were useful. The pattern of ischaemia on early MRI was a good predictor of prognosis. All infants with watershed or atypical patterns had a favourable outcome. The majority of infants with central patterns of ischaemia had an unfavourable outcome and all infants with a diffuse pattern had an unfavourable outcome. DWI was predictive of outcome group, as were early T1- and T2-W sequences and cranial US.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and its numerical expression via apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values are commonly utilized in non-invasive assessment of various brain pathologies. Although numerous studies have confirmed that ADC values could be pathognomic for various ring-enhancing lesions (RELs), their true potential is yet to be exploited in full. The article was designed to introduce an image analysis method allowing REL recognition independently of either absolute ADC values or specifically defined regions of interest within the evaluated image. For this purpose, the line of interest (LOI) was marked on each ADC map to cross all of the RELs' compartments. Using a machine learning approach, we analyzed the LOI between two representatives of the RELs, namely, brain abscess and glioblastoma (GBM). The diagnostic ability of the selected parameters as predictors for the machine learning algorithms was assessed using two models, the k-NN model and the SVM model with a Gaussian kernel. With the k-NN machine learning method, 80% of the abscesses and 100% of the GBM were classified correctly at high accuracy. Similar results were obtained via the SVM method. The proposed assessment of the LOI offers a new approach for evaluating ADC maps obtained from different RELs and contributing to the standardization of the ADC map assessment.

N2  -  The determination and mapping of the origin within the cerebellar nuclei of the various cerebellofugal components of the cerebellar peduncles by means of the method of retrograde reaction was studied. The site and extent of the retrograde changes in the nerve cells of the cerebellar nuclei following a variety of lesions inflicted upon the cerebellar peduncles and the brain stem in kittens warrant these conclusions: the great majority possibly all the cells of the cerebellar nuclei send their axons to the brain stem; the fibers from the lateral and interpositus nuclei join in the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle to form the major part of the brachium conjunctivum; about one quarter of the nerve cells of the lateral and interpositus nuclei most of them located in the caudal half of the nuclei remain intact after transection of the decussation of the brachium conjunctivum indicating that a considerable number of the axons from these nuclei do not decussate; the fibers from the medial nucleus leave the cerebellum by way of the superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles. The great majority of the fibers join the inferior peduncles in the cat distributed approximately equally on the 2 sides. The direct fibers (tract fastigiobulbaris rectus) have their cells of origin in the rostral half of the medial nucleus while the crossed fibers (fasciculus uncinatus) are derived from cells in the caudal 2/3 of the nucleus. Some of the fibers from the medial nucleus (presumably 10-15%) join the contralateral brachium conjunctirum. These fibers decussate within the cerebellum and do not decussate in the midbrain. Transection of the middle cerebellar peduncle was not followed by detectable retrograde changes In the cerebellar nuclei. The method of retrograde reaction failed to give informations concerning the origin of the fibers of the brachium con-junctivum that pass rostralward beyond the red nucleus.

N2  -  A 67-year-old woman was brought to our institution because of unconsciousness. Clinical and electrophysiological findings lead us to diagnose her with nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Initial magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintensity in the left cerebral cortex and the right cerebellum on diffusion-weighted image and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Single-photon emission computed tomography showed increased blood flow in the left frontal cerebrum but not in the right cerebellum. The hyperintensity in the left cerebrum on the follow-up FLAIR was still present. The contralateral cerebellum remained undamaged even though the blood flow was not increased in this region because the excitotoxicity there was far lesser than that in the cerebrum.

N2  -  Objective: To establish a cerebral hypoxia ischaemic model in piglets and to explore the early diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) as well as the expression of heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70) with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy ( HIE).
Methods: Twenty four 3 day old piglets were permanently ligated common carotid arteries bilaterally and ventilated with 3% oxygen for 30 minutes, and their brains were examined at three hours, six hours, and 24 hours after hypoxic ischaemia with T2 weighted images and diffusion weighted images. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) values were measured and HSP70 expression was detected in the central and peripheral regions of lesions.; Results: Abnormal signal intensity was detected on DWI and ADC maps in three hypoxic ischaemic groups. ADC values in the central lesions rapidly decreased, whereas ADC values in the peripheral regions reduced prominently at 24 hours after hypoxic ischaemia. There were significant differences ( p < 0.01) between ADC values of the central regions and the peripheral regions of lesions. The number of HSP70 positive cells was low at three hours, raised at the highest peak at six hours, and then rapidly decreased. There was statistical difference between HSP70 positive cells in the central regions and those in peripheral regions ( p < 0.01).; Conclusion: DWI may identify more early lesions, and improve conspicuity in the acute setting. ADC values can be used as an objective measure for hypoxic ischaemic injury. Tissue reversibility can be further reflected according to the information of ADC values and HSP70 immunohistochemical staining.

N2  -  Object. To identify the primary motor area (PMA) quickly and correctly, the authors used magnetic resonance (MR) axonography, including anisotropic diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging and three-dimensional anisotropic contrast (3DAC) imaging, which was performed to visualize the corticospinal tract mainly originating from the PMA.
Methods. All studies were obtained in 10 normal volunteers and in 17 patients with brain tumors affecting the central motor system. Data sets of anisotropic DW imaging and anatomical and functional (f)MR imaging were acquired while the participants executed simple hand movements. Offline processing of 3DAC MR axonography images was subsequently done to extract only the anisotropic components of the tract fibers. Somatosensory evoked fields (SSEFs) and intraoperative cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded after electrical stimulation of the median nerve.; Conclusions. In normal volunteers, anisotropic DW imaging, 3DAC imaging, fMR imaging, and magnetoencephalography consistently localized the PMA in both hemispheres. In contrast, fMR imaging and SSEFs failed to identify the PMA in seven and one of the 17 patients, respectively, because of cortical dysfunctions due to brain tumor. The anisotropic DW imaging data acquired within 30 seconds with no patient tasks successfully identified the PMA in 12 patients, and failed in five patients because of the lesions involving the frontal lobe. The anisotropic axonal components were distinctly visualized on 3DAC images and indicated the PMA location, which was confirmed on intraoperative SSEPs in all 17 affected hemispheres. Swift and noninvasive PMA identification by rapid scanning with MR axonography is a promising method for routine clinical use and is especially beneficial for patients who have severe cortical dysfunction in the PMA.

N2  -  Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is a new development in medicine that bridges the specialties of surgery and radiology. Deficiencies in the visualization of anatomical architecture and the perception of tumour boundaries in conventional open surgery have led to the integration of imaging within surgery. The superior soft tissue and multiplanar imaging features of magnetic resonance (MR) make this imaging modality superior to that of alternatives. The unique properties of MR to detect heat change and perfusion, and diffusion characteristics of tissue enhance the usefulness of this medium. Concurrent developments in computer aided image guidance and thermoablative technology, herald the era of minimally invasive tumour ablation. Applications have been developed for areas such as neurosurgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology.

N2  -  We analyzed whether the combined visualization of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) in perfusion imaging can identify prognosis-related growth patterns in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Sixty-five consecutive patients were examined with diffusion and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion weighted MRI. ADC and CBV maps were co-registered on the T1-w image and a region of interest (ROI) was manually delineated encompassing the enhancing lesion. Within this ROI pixels with ADC values < the 30th percentile (ADC(min)), pixels with CBV values > the 70th percentile (CBVmax) and the intersection of pixels with ADC(min) and CBVmax were automatically calculated and visualized. Initially, all tumors with a mean intersection greater than the upper quartile of the normally distributed mean intersection of all patients were subsumed to the first growth pattern termed big intersection (BI). Subsequently, the remaining tumors' growth patterns were categorized depending on the qualitative representation of ADC(min), CBVmax and their intersection. Log-rank test exposed a significantly longer overall survival of BI (n = 16) compared to non-BI group (n = 49) (p = 0.0057). Thirty-one, four and 14 patients of the non-BI group were classified as predominant ADC-, CBV- and mixed growth group, respectively. In a multivariate Cox regression model, the BI-, CBV- and mixed groups had significantly lower adjusted hazard ratios (p-value, alpha(Bonferroni) < 0.006) when compared to the reference group ADC: 0.29 (0.0027), 0.11 (0.038) and 0.33 (0.0059). Our study provides evidence that the combination of diffusion and perfusion imaging allows visualization of different glioblastoma growth patterns that are associated with prognosis. A possible biological hypothesis for this finding could be the interpretation of the ADC(min) fraction as the invasion-front of tumor cells while the CBVmax fraction might represent the vascular rich tumor border that is "trailing behind" the invasion-front in the ADC group.

N2  -  Signal intensity in Na-23 images is altered in pathologic conditions such as ischemia and may provide information regarding tissue viability complementary to MR diffusion and perfusion imaging. However, the multicomponent transverse relaxation of Na-23 (spin 3/2) complicates the determination of tissue sodium concentration from Na-23 images with nonzero echo-time. The purpose of this study was to measure the long component time constant of tissue sodium T-2(*) relaxation in the healthy human brain at 4 T. Multiecho gradient-echo Na-23 images (10 echo-times ranging from 3.8-68.7 ms) were acquired in five healthy human volunteers. T-2(*) was quantified on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a nonnegative least squares fitting routine using 100 equally spaced bins between 0.5-99.5 ms and parametric maps were produced representing components between 0.5-3, 3.1-50, 50.1-98, and 98.1-99.5 ms. The long T-2(*) component of tissue sodium (average +/- standard deviation) varied between cortex (occipital = 22.0 +/- 2.4 ms), white matter (parietal 18.2 +/- 1.9 ms), and subcortical gray matter (thalamus = 16.9 +/- 2.4 ms). These results demonstrate considerable regional variability and establish a foundation for future characterization of Na-23 T-2(*). in 2 conditions such as cerebral ischemia and cancer.

N2  -  Serotonin (5-HT) transporter, the mechanism for 5-HT high affinity uptake, is the essential component for the termination of 5-HT transmission. In order to identify transporter sites on 5-HT neurons or on other 5-HT uptaking cells, three rabbit antisera against cocaine sensitive-serotonin transporter (5-HTT) were produced. Antisera 5-HTT55 (against amino acid sequence 55-68 in cytoplasmic N-terminal) and 5-HTT315 (against amino acid sequence 315-325, a 3rd external loop peptide) were produced against synthetic multiple-antigenic peptides (MAP). Antiserum 5-HTTN was produced against a fusion protein of the first 71 amino acids of N-terminal peptide expressed in recombinant DNA transformed bacteria. SDS-PAGE/Western blots indicate that 5-HTT55 and 5-HTT315 recognized bands of 74 and 64 kDa in rat brains with densities in the order of cortex greater than or equal to hippocampus > cerebellum, but not in liver, or muscle. The 5-HTTN recognized the fusion protein expressed in the bacteria,and the 64 kDa band with a similar density profile in the rat brain regions, and negative staining in liver and muscle. The immunocytochemistry of all three antisera revealed 5-HTT-immunostaining (5-HTT-im) in a pattern similar to 5-HT fiber distribution. 5-HTT55 and 5-HTT315 stainings were punctate in appearance; while 5-HTTN outlined the fibers in the 5-HT fiber areas, and neurons in raphe but not in substantia nigra or locus ceruleus. The preimmune serum and immune serum preabsorbed with 5-HTTN showed negative or diminished staining. Specific neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesion removed all of the 5-HTTN fibers from the injection site, indicating that 5-HTTN-im fibers are 5-HT fibers in nature. Our study indicates that the three antibodies we produced recognize various domains of the 5-HTT. Our 5-HTT antibodies could be used as new markers of 5-HT fibers, and are particularly useful for the study of the plasticity of 5-HT fibers free of the complications involved with 5-HT content.

N2  -  Gliomas are neoplasms that arise from glial cell origin and represent the largest fraction of primary malignant brain tumours (77%). These highly infiltrative malignant cell clusters modify brain structure and function through expansion, invasion and intra-tumoral modification. Depending on the growth rate of the tumour, location and degree of expansion, functional reorganization may not lead to overt changes in behaviour despite significant cerebral adaptation. Studies in simulated lesion models and in patients with stroke reveal both local and distal functional disturbances, using measures of anatomical brain networks. Investigations over the last two decades have sought to use diffusion tensor imaging tractography data in the context of intracranial tumours to improve surgical planning, intraoperative functional localization, and post-operative interpretation of functional change. In this study, we used diffusion tensor imaging tractography to assess the impact of tumour location on the white matter structural network. To better understand how various lobe localized gliomas impact the topology underlying efficiency of information transfer between brain regions, we identified the major alterations in brain network connectivity patterns between the ipsilesional versus contralesional hemispheres in patients with gliomas localized to the frontal, parietal or temporal lobe. Results were indicative of altered network efficiency and the role of specific brain regions unique to different lobe localized gliomas. This work draws attention to connections and brain regions which have shared structural susceptibility in frontal, parietal and temporal lobe glioma cases. This study also provides a preliminary anatomical basis for understanding which affected white matter pathways may contribute to preoperative patient symptomology.

N2  -  We present the first in vivo application of the filter-exchange imaging protocol for diffusion MRI. The protocol allows noninvasive mapping of the rate of water exchange between microenvironments with different self-diffusivities, such as the intracellular and extracellular spaces in tissue. Since diffusional water exchange across the cell membrane is a fundamental process in human physiology and pathophysiology, clinically feasible and noninvasive imaging of the water exchange rate would offer new means to diagnose disease and monitor treatment response in conditions such as cancer and edema. The in vivo use of filter-exchange imaging was demonstrated by studying the brain of five healthy volunteers and one intracranial tumor (meningioma). Apparent exchange rates in white matter range from 0.8 +/- 0.08 s-1 in the internal capsule, to 1.6 +/- 0.11 s-1 for frontal white matter, indicating that low values are associated with high myelination. Solid tumor displayed values of up to 2.9 +/- 0.8 s-1. In white matter, the apparent exchange rate values suggest intra-axonal exchange times in the order of seconds, confirming the slow exchange assumption in the analysis of diffusion MRI data. We propose that filter-exchange imaging could be used clinically to map the water exchange rate in pathologies. Filter-exchange imaging may also be valuable for evaluating novel therapies targeting the function of aquaporins. Magn Reson Med, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  PURPOSE
We aimed to investigate the effect of key imaging parameters on the accuracy of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps using a phantom model combined with ADC calculation simulation and propose strategies to improve the accuracy of ADC quantification.; METHODS; Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were acquired on a phantom model using single-shot echo-planar imaging DWI at 1.5 T scanner by varying key imaging parameters including number of averages (NEX), repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and diffusion preparation pulses. DWI signal simulations were performed for varying TR and TE.; RESULTS; Magnetic resonance diffusion signal and ADC maps were dependent on TR and TE imaging parameters as well as number of diffusion preparation pulses, but not on the NEX. However, the choice of a long TR and short TE could be used to minimize their effects on the resulting DWI sequences and ADC maps.; CONCLUSION; This study shows that TR and TE imaging parameters affect the diffusion images and ADC maps, but their effect can be minimized by utilizing diffusion preparation pulses. Another key imaging parameter, NEX, is less relevant to DWI and ADC quantification as long as DWI signal-to-noise ratio is above a certain level. Based on the phantom results and data simulations, DWI acquisition protocol can be optimized to obtain accurate ADC maps in routine clinical application for whole body imaging.

N2  -  Background: The substantia nigra (SN) is suspected to be affected after remote infarction, in view of its large array of connections with the supratentorial brain. Whether secondary involvement of SN worsens overall clinical outcome after a supratentorial stroke has not previously been studied.
Purpose: To assess longitudinal changes in SN R2* by using MRI in the setting of ipsilesional supratentorial infarct and the relationship of SN signal change to clinical outcome.; Materials and Methods: Participants prospectively included from 2012 to 2015 were evaluated at 24-72 hours (baseline visit) and at 1 year with MRI to quantify R2*. The SN was segmented bilaterally to calculate an R2* asymmetry index (SN-AI); greater SN-AI indicated greater relative R2* in the ipsilateral compared with contralateral SN. The 95th percentile of R2* (hereafter, SN-AI 95) was compared according to infarct location with mixed linear regression models. We also conducted voxel-based comparisons of R2* and identified individual infarcted voxels associated with high SN-AI 95 through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Multivariable regression models tested the association between SN-AI 95 and clinical scores.; Results: A total of 181 participants were evaluated (127 men, 54 women; mean age 6 standard deviation, 64.2 years 6 13.1; 75 striatum infarcts, 106 other locations). Visual inspection, SN-AI 95, and average maps consistently showed higher SN R2* at 1 year if ipsilateral striatum was infarcted than if it was not (SN-AI 95, 4.25 vs 20.88; P < .001), but this was not observed at baseline. The striatal location of the infarct was associated with higher SN-AI 95 at 1 year independently from infarct volume, SN-AI 95 at baseline, microbleeds, age, and sex (beta = 4.99; P < .001). Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping confirmed that striatum but also insula, internal capsule, and external capsule were associated with higher SN-AI 95 at 1 year. SN-AI 95 was an independent contributor of poor motor outcome (Box and Block Test, beta = 2.62 points; P = .01).; Conclusion: In patients with stroke, greater substantia nigra R2*, likely reflective of greater iron content, can be observed at 1 year ipsilateral from remote infarcts of specific location, which is associated with worse motor function.

N2  -  The use of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion and C-11-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) for glioma grading is currently not standardized. The purpose of this study was to identify regions of interest (ROIs) that enable the best performance and clinical applicability in both methods, as well as to evaluate the complementarity of DSC perfusion and MET-PET in spatial hotspot definition.
In 41 patient PETMRI datasets, different ROIs were drawn: in T2-hyperintense tumour, in T2-hyperintense tumour and adjacent oedema and in tumour areas with contrast enhancement, altered perfusion or pathological radiotracer uptake. The performance of DSC perfusion and MET-PET using the different ROIs to distinguish high- and low-grade gliomas was assessed. The spatial overlap of hotspots identified by DSC perfusion and MET-PET was assessed visually.; ROIs in T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence-hyperintense tumour revealed the most significant differences between high- and low-grade gliomas and reached the highest diagnostic performance in both DSC perfusion (p = 0.046; area under the curve = 0.74) and MET-PET (p = 0.007; area under the curve = 0.80). The combination of methods yielded an area under the curve of 0.80. Hotspots were completely overlapped in one half of the patients, partially overlapped in one third of the patients and present in only one method in approximately 20% of the patients.; For multi-parametric examinations with DSC perfusion and MET-PET, we recommend an ROI definition based on T2-hyperintense tumour. DSC perfusion and MET-PET contain complementary information concerning the spatial hotspot definition.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to optimize intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) measurement in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of breast cancer by separating perfusion and diffusion effects through the determination of an optimal threshold b-value, thus benign and cancerous breast tissues can be accurately differentiated using IVIM-derived diffusion and perfusion parameters.
Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight patients, with biopsy-confirmed breast cancers, were studied with a 3T MRI scanner, using T1-weighted dynamic contrastenhanced MRI images, and diffusion-weighted images with nine b-values, ranging from 0 to 1000 smm(2) . IVIM-derived parameter maps for tissue diffusion coefficients D, perfusion fraction f, and pseudo-diffusion coefficients D* were computed using the segmented fitting method with optimized threshold b-value, and the sum of squared residuals (SSR) were calculated for IVIM-derived parameters in different breast lesions.; Results: The IVIM analysis method developed in this work can separate perfusion and diffusion effects with the optimal threshold b-value of 300 smm(2), and the results of diffusion and perfusion parameters from IVIM analysis can be used to differentiate pathological changes in breast tissues. It was found that the averages and standard deviations of the diffusion and perfusion parameters, D, f, D*, are the following, for malignant, benign and normal breast tissues respectively: D (0.813 +- 0.225 9 10(-)3 mm(2)s, 1.437 +- 0.538 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, 1.838 +- 0.213 x 10(-3) mm(2)s), f (10.73 +- 3.44%, 7.86 +- 3.70%, 8.92 +- 3.72%), D* (15.23 +- 12.17x10(-3) mm(2)s, 12.02 +- 3.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, 12.03 +- 7.21 x 10(-3) mm(2)s).; Conclusion: IVIM-derived diffusion and perfusion parameter maps depend highly on the choice of threshold b-value. Using the methodology developed in this work, and with the optimized threshold b-value, the diffusion and perfusion parameters of breast tissues can be accurately assessed, making IVIM MRI a technique of choice for differential diagnosis of breast cancer.

N2  -  Objective: Studies of motor outcome after Neonatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke (NAIS) often rely on lesion mapping using MRI. However, clinical measurements indicate that motor deficit can be different than what would solely be anticipated by the lesion extent and location. Because this may be explained by the cortical disconnections between motor areas due to necrosis following the stroke, the investigation of the motor network can help in the understanding of visual inspection and outcome discrepancy. In this study, we propose to examine the structural connectivity between motor areas in NAIS patients compared to healthy controls in order to define the cortical and subcortical connections that can reflect the motor outcome. Methods: Thirty healthy controls and 32 NAIS patients with and without Cerebral Palsy (CP) underwent MRI acquisition and manual assessment. The connectome of all participants was obtained from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. Results: Significant disconnections in the lesioned and contra-lesioned hemispheres of patients were found. Furthermore, significant correlations were detected between the structural connectivity metric of specific motor areas and manuality assessed by the Box and Block Test (BBT) scores in patients. Interpretation: Using the connectivity measures of these links, the BBT score can be estimated using a multiple linear regression model. In addition, the presence or not of CP can also be predicted using the KNN classification algorithm. According to our results, the structural connectome can be an asset in the estimation of gross manual dexterity and can help uncover structural changes between brain regions related to NAIS.

N2  -  Object. The authors performed a retrospective study to assess the impact of functional neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI (iMRI) on surgery of extratemporal epileptogenic lesions on postsurgical morbidity and seizure control.
Methods. Twenty-five patients (14 females and 11 males) underwent extratemporal resections for drug-resistant epilepsy close to speechmotor brain areas or adjacent to white matter tracts. The mean age at surgery was 34 years (range 12-67 years). The preoperative mean disease duration was 13.2 years. To avoid awake craniotomy, cortical motor-sensory representation was mapped during preoperative evaluation in 14 patients and speech representation was mapped in 15 patients using functional MRI. In addition, visualization of the pyramidal tract was performed in 11 patients, of the arcuate fascicle in 7 patients, and of the visual tract in 6 patients using diffusion tensor imaging. The mean minimum distance of tailored resection between the eloquent brain areas was 5.6 mm. During surgery, blood oxygen level-dependent imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data were integrated into neuronavigation and displayed through the operating microscope. The postoperative mean follow-up was 44.2 months.; Results. In 20% of these patients, further intraoperative resection was performed because of intraoperatively documented residual lesions according to iMRI findings. At the end of resection, the final iMRI scans confirmed achievement of total resection of the putative epileptogenic lesion in all patients. Postoperatively, transient complications and permanent complications were observed in 20% and 12% of patients, respectively. Favorable postoperative seizure control (Engel Classes I and II) was achieved in 84% and seizure freedom in 72% of these consecutive surgical patients.; Conclusions. By using functional neuronavigation and iMRI for treatment of epileptogenic brain lesions, the authors achieved a maximum extent of resection despite the lesions' proximity to eloquent brain cortex and fiber tracts in all cases. The authors' results underline possible benefits of this technique leading to a favorable seizure outcome with acceptable neurological deficit rates in difficult-to-treat extratemporal epilepsy.

N2  -  Brain regions are removed to treat lesions, but great care must be taken not to disturb or remove functional areas in the lesion and in-surrounding tissue where healthy and diseased cells may be intermingled, especially for infiltrating tumors. Cortical functional areas and fiber tracts can be localized preoperatively by probabilistic anatomical tools, but mapping of functional integrity by neurophysiology is essential. Identification of the primary motor cortex seems to be more effectively performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) than functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Language area localization requires auditory evoked potentials or TMS, as well as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging for fiber tracts. Somatosensory cortex is most effectively mapped by somatosensory evoked potentials. Crucial eloquent areas, such as the central sulcus, primary somatomotor areas, corticospinal tract must be defined and for some areas that must be removed, potential compensations may be identified. Oncological/functional ratio must be optimized, resecting the tumor maximally but also sparingly, as far as possible, the areas that mediate indispensable functions. In some cases, a transient postoperative deficit may be inevitable. In this article, we review intraoperative exploration of motricity, language, somatosensory, visual and vestibular function, calculation, memory and components of consciousness.

N2  -  Choreoathetosis is a rare neurologic complication of the diabetic disease. The purpose of this case report is to increase the knowledge of such occurrence by describing the case of an elderly woman who was admitted to our institution for an over 20-day history of choreic movement in the left side of the body. She had a 6-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with a poor metabolic control including a glycosylated hemoglobin of 13%. Unenhanced computed tomography of the brain was negative. At magnetic resonance imaging, the right putamen showed high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and an area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. During the hospitalization, an adequate diet therapy was performed, and insulin therapy was gradually adjusted using regular insulin at main meals associated with basal insulin (glargine) "bed time". This resulted in progressive normalization of blood glucose values and an improvement of dyskinesia. There is a deep correlation between non-chetotic hyperglycemia and neurologic lesions leading to choreoathetosis. The etiopathogenesis seems multifactorial, and include hyperosmolar damage on cortical cells, alteration in GABA neurotransmission and in cerebral vascular self-regulation mechanism. Notably, in DM type 2 choreoathetosis may be related to both vascular and neuro-metabolic alterations in the basal nucleus due to inadequate glycemic control continuing in the time. This rare complication of DM type 2 is a pathological entity to be considered benign, since it is generally transient and reversible with the attainment of an adequate metabolic compensation.

N2  -  We aimed in this study to assess the clinical usefulness of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps in the evaluation of lacunar infarctions in striatum, internal capsule and thalamus. We retrospectively reviewed 28 patients (18 men, 10 women; mean age 63 years) who had acute lacunar infarction in striatum, internal capsule and thalamus on diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated in addition to conventional T2 weighted images (T2WI) and trace maps of DWI. Two radiologists reviewed the location of infarcts in combination with and without FA maps. Exact location of infarction was determined by FA maps, i.e. on the white band of internal capsule or outside the internal capsule. Accuracy and inter-observer agreement on determination of the location of infarction was evaluated. Accuracy of infarct localization by T2WI-DWI only was varied from 72 to 91% according to the observers. Inter-observer agreement value was moderate (Kappa=0.446), when images were interpreted by T2WI-DWI only. Clinical manifestation of each lesions were varied, but sensory motor stroke was mainly observed in thalamic lesion (50%), while pure motor hemiparesis was predominant in the case of infarct involving internal capsule, corona radiata (91%) and basal ganglia (83%). The FA map is useful in the evaluation of lacunar lesions in striatum, internal capsule and thalamus. Clinical presentation varies according to the exact location of lacunar infarctions, and more accurate diagnosis can be made by FA maps as well as conventional T2-weighted image and DWI.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent experience suggests that diffusion-weighted MR imaging may be decisive in the differential diagnosis of ring-enhaneing cerebral lesions. Whether restricted diffusion within a ring-enhancing cerebral mass lesion is pathognomonic for abscess was studied.
METHODS: Seventeen patients with ring-enhancing cerebral lesions (three abscesses, six glioblastomas, eight metastases) on conventional contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were examined with echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and the ADCs were calculated for all lesions. Lesions with signs of intralesional hemorrhage on unenhanced T1-weighted images were excluded.; RESULTS: The central portion of all six glioblastomas and seven of eight metastases showed unrestricted diffusion, whereas two of three abscesses showed restricted diffusion (low ADC values) in their cavity. However, restricted diffusion also was found in one metastasis, and one abscess within a postoperative cavity showed unrestricted diffusion within a larger nondependent portion.; CONCLUSION. In patients with ring-enhancing cerebral mass lesions, restricted diffusion might be characteristic but is not pathognomonic for abscess, as low ADC values also may be found in brain metastases.

N2  -  PurposeThe purpose of this study was to develop a neural network that accurately performs diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction from highly accelerated scans.
Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted using data acquired between 2013 and 2018 and was approved by the local institutional review board. DTI acquired in healthy volunteers (N=10) was used to train a neural network, DiffNet, to reconstruct fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps from small subsets of acquired DTI data with between 3 and 20 diffusion-encoding directions. FA and MD maps were then reconstructed in volunteers and in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, N=12) using both DiffNet and conventional reconstructions. Accuracy and precision were quantified in volunteer scans and compared between reconstructions. The accuracy of tumor delineation was compared between reconstructed patient data by evaluating agreement between DTI-derived tumor volumes and volumes defined by contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. Comparisons were performed using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).; ResultsDiffNet FA reconstructions were more accurate and precise compared with conventional reconstructions for all acceleration factors. DiffNet permitted reconstruction with only three diffusion-encoding directions with significantly lower bias than the conventional method using six directions (0.010.01 vs 0.06 +- 0.01, P<0.001). While MD-based tumor delineation was not substantially different with DiffNet (AUC range: 0.888-0.902), DiffNet FA had higher AUC than conventional reconstructions for fixed scan time and achieved similar performance with shorter scans (conventional, six directions: AUC=0.926, DiffNet, three directions: AUC=0.920).; ConclusionDiffNet improved DTI reconstruction accuracy, precision, and tumor delineation performance in GBM while permitting reconstruction from only three diffusion-encoding directions.

N2  -  Simple Summary Advances in our understanding of human brain structure and function have been facilitated through improved mapping of the structural and functional neural connections throughout the human brain 'connectome'. By utilizing different statistical techniques and non-invasive imaging modalities to capture the structural and functional properties of the brain connectome, such as with diffusion or functional MRI, the brain can also be represented as a graph of individual nodes which are connected throughout a network. Previously, the neurosurgical community has often relied on traditional maps of the human brain to identify highly functional regions, often called 'eloquent', but these regions differ between patients and do not always provide an adequate guide to reliably prevent functional deficits. Through graphically representing the brain, mathematical graph theory approaches may be able to provide additional information on important inter-individual network properties and functionally eloquent brain regions. This review attempts to outline and review the applicability of graph theory for neurosurgery. Improving patient safety and preserving eloquent brain are crucial in neurosurgery. Since there is significant clinical variability in post-operative lesions suffered by patients who undergo surgery in the same areas deemed compensable, there is an unknown degree of inter-individual variability in brain 'eloquence'. Advances in connectomic mapping efforts through diffusion tractography allow for utilization of non-invasive imaging and statistical modeling to graphically represent the brain. Extending the definition of brain eloquence to graph theory measures of hubness and centrality may help to improve our understanding of individual variability in brain eloquence and lesion responses. While functional deficits cannot be immediately determined intra-operatively, there has been potential shown by emerging technologies in mapping of hub nodes as an add-on to existing surgical navigation modalities to improve individual surgical outcomes. This review aims to outline and review current research surrounding novel graph theoretical concepts of hubness, centrality, and eloquence and specifically its relevance to brain mapping for pre-operative planning and intra-operative navigation in neurosurgery.

T2  -  MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used in tumor growth models to provide information on the infiltration pathways of tumor cells into the surrounding brain tissue. When a patient-specific DTI is not available, a template image such as a DTI atlas can be transformed to the patient anatomy using image registration. This study investigates a model, the invariance under coordinate transform (ICT), that transforms diffusion tensors from a template image to the patient image, based on the principle that the tumor growth process can be mapped, at any point in time, between the images using the same transformation function that we use to map the anatomy. The ICT model allows the mapping of tumor cell densities and tumor fronts (as iso-levels of tumor cell density) from the template image to the patient image for inclusion in radiotherapy treatment planning. The proposed approach transforms the diffusion tensors to simulate tumor growth in locally deformed anatomy and outputs the tumor cell density distribution over time. The ICT model is validated in a cohort of ten brain tumor patients. Comparative analysis with the tumor cell density in the original template image shows that the ICT model accurately simulates tumor cell densities in the deformed image space. By creating radiotherapy target volumes as tumor fronts, this study provides a framework for more personalized radiotherapy treatment planning, without the use of additional imaging.

N2  -  Large unilateral lesions were made in the superior olivary complex of 9 adult cats. After 1-7 postoperative days the animals were killed by perfusion-fixation, and the brains were frozen and sectioned. Lesions were mapped in cresyl violet material. Degeneration was studied in modified Nauta preparations. Distributions of degeneration were studied in recent subdivisions of the cat cochlear nucleus. Because more abundant preterminal degeneration occurred after 4 days, these animals were predominantly used for general descriptions of fiber distribution. In general, most preterminal degeneration occurred in the contralateral anterior ventral cochlear nucleus, the overlying granule cells and in deep dorsal cochlear nuclei of both sides. Sparse to moderate, mostly peridendritic degeneration occurred in posterior ventral cochlear nuclei; less preterminal degeneration occurred caudally than rostrally. Because fibers of passage were not differently distributed from those in 2 control cats (subjected to electrode insertion only), these fibers were not considered in overall patterns of superior olivary complex input to cochlear nuclei. Such patterns are discussed with respect to classes of cell innervated, possible reciprocal connections, and other known inputs to cochlear nucleus. In particular, primary afferent inputs vs. efferents described here were discussed. Possible functions of descending fibers were briefly considered.

N2  -  The aims of this study were to investigate and categorize peritumoral fiber tract alterations while considering changes in metabolism and integrity of fiber structures using multimodal neuroimaging-that is, PET with O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine and diffusion tensor imaging evaluated by fiber density mapping-and to correlate categories of fiber alterations with pre-operative neurologic deficits and postoperative course. Methods: We examined 26 patients with cerebral gliomas. Fiber density data were used to segment peritumoral fiber structures and were coregistered to anatomic MR images and PET data. Fiber density and O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine uptake values were evaluated as ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratios. Four metabolic categories were defined on the basis of O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine values: tumor-infiltrated tissue, reactive tissue (astrogliosis and microglial activation), normal brain tissue, and tissue with attenuated amino acid metabolism. Fiber density values were grouped in 3 categories for structural integrity: compressed, normal, and attenuated fibers. Results: We evaluated and classified 103 peritumoral fiber structures with 10 patterns of fiber tract alterations. Fiber structures in tumor-infiltrated, reactive, and normal brain tissue showed compressed fibers, displaced fibers, and (partly) destroyed fibers, respectively. Attenuated amino acid metabolism was associated only with attenuated fiber density. Thirteen patients showed white matter-related neurologic deficits (paresis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, or anopia) as initial symptoms. Three patients showed tumor infiltration in the corresponding fiber tracts; all the others had reactive or normal brain tissue. Fiber structures were compressed or attenuated but not normal. The 3 patients with tumor infiltration in the corresponding fiber tracts and 1 with compressed fibers in normal brain showed no improvements or worsening of the deficits in the postoperative course. Eight patients with the corresponding fiber tracts in reactive or normal brain areas showed improvement of deficits. One patient underwent biopsy only. Conclusion: Our multimodal neuroimaging approach provides complementary information and more detailed understanding of peritumoral fiber tract alterations in gliomas which are more complex as described so far. We presented a classification model for systematic assessment of these alterations that may be helpful for treatment planning and prediction of patients' prognoses.

N2  -  Background and PurposeHemispatial neglect is characterized by a reduced awareness to stimuli on the contralateral side. Current literature suggesting that damage to the right parietal lobe and attention networks may cause hemispatial neglect is conflicting and can be improved by investigating a connectomic model of the "neglect system" and the anatomical specificity of regions involved in it.MethodsA meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of hemispatial neglect was used to identify regions associated with neglect. We applied parcellation schemes to these regions and performed diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) tractography to determine their connectivity. By overlaying neglect areas and maps of the attention networks, we studied the relationship between them.ResultsThe meta-analysis generated a list of 13 right hemisphere parcellations. These 13 neglect-related parcellations were predominantly linked by the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) throughout a fronto-parietal-temporal network. We found that the dorsal and ventral attention networks showed partial overlap with the neglect system and included various other higher-order networks.ConclusionsWe provide an anatomically specific connectomic model of the neurobehavioral substrates underlying hemispatial neglect. Our model suggests a fronto-parietal-temporal network linked via the SLF supports the functions impaired in neglect and implicates various higher-order networks which are not limited to the attention networks.

N2  -  Purpose As conventional quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters are weakly associated with cognitive impairment (CI) in early multiple sclerosis (MS), we explored microstructural white matter alterations in early MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) comparing patients with or without CI. Methods Based on a preceding tract-based spatial statistics analysis (3 Tesla MRI) which contrasted 106 patients with early MS or CIS and 49 healthy controls, diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy, FA, mean diffusivity, MD) were extracted from significant clusters using an atlas-based approach. The FA and MD were compared between patients with (Ci_P n = 14) and without (Cp_P n = 81) cognitive impairment in a subset of patients who underwent CI screening. Results The FA was reduced in Ci_P compared to Cp_P in the splenium of corpus callosum (p = 0.001), right parahippocampal cingulum (p = 0.002) and fornix cres./stria terminalis (0.042), left posterior corona radiata (p = 0.012), bilateral cerebral peduncles, medial lemniscus and in cerebellar tracts. Increased MD was detected in the splenium of corpus callosum (p = 0.01). The CI-related localizations overlapped only partially with MS lesions. Conclusion Microstructural white matter alterations at disease onset were detectable in Ci_P compared to Cp_P in known cognitively relevant fiber tracts, indicating the relevance of early treatment initiation in MS and CIS.
