N2  -  In order to assess the role of striatal dopamine (DA) afferents in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, we have studied a large series of rats sustaining 2, 3, or 4 unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the lateral striatum. This type of lesion produced a dose-dependent depletion of DA fibers in the caudate-putamen, which was most pronounced in the lateral aspects of this structure. An additional group of rats was injected with 6-OHDA in the medial forebrain bundle to obtain complete DA denervation on one side of the brain. During a course of chronic L-DOPA treatment, rats with intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesions developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), which mapped onto striatal domains exhibiting at least similar to90% denervation, as judged by DA transporter autoradiography. The denervated areas showed local upregulation of preproenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA, and FosB-like immunoreactivity, which were highly correlated with the rats' AIM scores. When compared to completely DA-denervated animals, the rats with intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesions showed an overall lower incidence, lower severity and different topographic distribution of AIMS. The involvement of proximal limb and axial muscles in the abnormal movements was proportional to the spreading of the lesion from lateral towards medial aspects of the caudate-putamen. Locomotive AIMS were only seen in rats with complete lesions, but not in any of the animals with intrastriatal 6-OHDA (which showed > 5% DA fiber sparing in the medial striatum). Intrastriatally 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had a larger therapeutic window for L-DOPA than did rats with complete bundle lesions, since they exhibited an overall lower predisposition to dyskinesia but a similar degree of drug-induced motor improvement in a test of forelimb stepping. Our results are the first to demonstrate that selective and partial DA denervation in the sensorimotor part of the striatum can confer cellular and behavioral supersensitivity to L-DOPA, and that the phenomenology of L-DOPA-induced rat AIMS can be accounted for by the topography of DA denervation within the caudate-putamen.

N2  -  Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary radiotherapy method developed to treat patients with certain malignant tumours. To date, over 300 treatments have been carried out at the Finnish BNCT facility in various on-going and past clinical trials. In this technical review, we discuss our research work in the field of medical physics to form the groundwork for the Finnish BNCT patient treatments, as well as the possibilities to further develop and optimize the method in the future. Accordingly, the following aspects are described: neutron sources, beam dosimetry, treatment planning, boron imaging and determination, and finally the possibilities to detect the efficacy and effects of BNCT on patients.

N2  -  Purpose: To optimize the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map for monitoring tumor treatment response in cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Using Monte Carlo simulations, measurement precision of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and particularly accuracy of threshold determination from healthy reference tissue, are evaluated by investigating the repeatability limit of the ADC as a function of different degrees of diffusion weighting of the sequence. Phantom and in-vivo experiments are performed to verify and illustrate the results of the simulations. Results: While diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map is hardly diminished by differing values of the T2 relaxation time in tumor and reference tissue, it is shown to be impaired by differing ADCs, resulting in erroneously determined segmentation thresholds. This problem can be addressed by decreasing the maximum b-factor and increasing the number of signal averages at the maximum b-factor or, alternatively, the number of b-factors while favoring schemes with higher b-factors. Phantom experiments confirm the results of the simulations. In-vivo data are presented to illustrate the effect of sequence optimization on the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map. Conclusion: The present work demonstrates that the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map can be impaired by inaccurate segmentation thresholds and derives means for its optimization that will increase the fidelity of future clinical studies.

N2  -  Preoperative brain mapping methods are particularly important in modern neuro-oncology when a tumor affects eloquent language areas since damage to parts of the language circuits can cause significant impairments in daily life. This narrative review examines the literature regarding preoperative and intraoperative language mapping using repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rnTMS) with or without direct electrical stimulation (DES) in adult patients with tumors in eloquent language areas. The literature shows that rnTMS is accurate in detecting preexisting language disorders and positive intraoperative mapping regions. In terms of the region extent and clinical outcomes, rnTMS has been shown to be accurate in identifying positive sites to guide resection, reducing surgery duration and craniotomy size and thus improving clinical outcomes. Before incorporating rnTMS into the neurosurgical workflow, the refinement of protocols and a consensus within the neuro-oncology community are required.

N2  -  Diffuse World Health Organization grade II glioma (GIIG) is a slow-growing brain cancer that migrates along the white matter (WM) tracts. Neuroplastic changes were described in reaction to GIIG progression, opening the window to extensive cerebral surgical resection in patients able to resume an active life with no functional consequences. However, atlases of cortico-subcortical neural plasticity emphasized the limited potential of axonal reorganization. Yet, the removal of WM involved by GIIG can be possible, at least to some extent, without generating permanent neurological disturbances. Here, the aim was to discuss mechanisms underlying functional compensation which make feasible resection of the subcortical component of GIIG and to propose a new model of adaptative neural reconfiguration at the level of the axonal connectivity. In this model, 2 parts of the WM tracts are considered: (1) the stem of the bundle that represents the actual limitation of plastic potential, as supported by reproducible behavioral disorders elicited by intraoperative axonal electrostimulation mapping (ESM) and (2) the terminations/origins of the bundle that may no longer be critical in case of functional reallocation of the cortex to/from which these WM fibers run-thus inducing no behavioral troubles during direct ESM. Understanding that a certain degree of axonal compensation in specific portions of the tracts is driven by cortical remodeling may enable to rethink the concept of WM plasticity and to refine the preoperative estimation of extent of resection for GIIG. Identifying eloquent fibers by ESM, especially their convergence in the depth, is essential to achieve an individualized connectome-based resection.

N2  -  Introduction: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is an X-linked hereditary disorder caused by a deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Patients present with hyperuricaemia, intellectual difficulties, self-injurious behaviour and movement disorders such as dystonia and spasticity. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is reported to be beneficial for control of dystonia and self-injurious behaviour. We describe our case series of four patients who had bilateral GPi stimulation for LND. Methods: Prospectively collected data on demographics, clinical outcomes, outcome measures (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale [BFMDRS] and Behavioural Problems Inventory [BPI]) and complications were analysed. Results: Four male patients between the ages of 11 to 16 years had DBS implantation between the years 2011 and 2018. The target chosen was the GPi nucleus, and in all but one patient, a total of 4 electrodes were inserted into the anterior limbic and posterior motor parts of the GPi. Two patients had infected implants requiring a period of explantation and antibiotics followed by reimplantation. Improvements in both dystonic symptoms and self-injurious behaviour were achieved with stimulation as evidenced by stable BFMDRS scores and decrease in BPI scores in the self-injury and aggressive/destructive behaviours sub-categories. Conclusion: LND is a challenging condition to treat. Surgical treatment helps control dystonia and self-injurious behaviour, resulting in better care, comfort and quality of life for patient and carers.
Objective: Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an established surgical treatment for dystonia in children. MRI-based direct targeting has become the method of choice for stereotactic DBS surgery, but accurate identification of the target structure and of the final position of electrode contacts remains challenging. The aim of this study was to study the applicability of normative brain atlases in the clinical practice of DBS in children. Methods: Six children with bilateral GPi-DBS for dystonia (Medtronic 3389) were reviewed. The preoperative planning MRI was fused with the postoperative CT and the anatomical position of each electrode contact was determined by a senior surgeon on a standard workstation (Stealth, Medtronic). All scans were blindly processed (Lead-DBS Toolbox), normalized to MNI space and merged with a normative brain atlas for 3D reconstruction and parcellation of the basal ganglia. The locations of electrode contacts were classified as GPi, internal lamina, GPe or outside GP. Surgeon?s and Lead-DBS results were compared. Results: The median age of the children was 10 (range 7?12). A total of 12 DBS electrodes (48 contacts) were studied. There was a 56% (2748) agreement between surgeon and Lead-DBS. Following this comparison the surgeon reclassified 13 (27%) electrode contacts resulting in 75% (3648) agreement. 91% (1112) of mismatched positions lay within 1.3?mm (one electrode width, within tolerances of image fusion). Conclusion: Visual identification of electrode contacts on the child?s own scan remains the gold standard but image quality, fusion accuracy and pathology may introduce errors resulting in electrode contacts appearing outside the GPi. Toolboxes such as Lead-DBS may be a useful adjunct and assist in verification. Further studies with a larger cohort of patients are required to validate this method, and its role in DBS programming and outcome in children.; Introduction: The use of stereoelectroencepha-lography (SEEG) in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy is increasing. The utility of SEEG in MRI negative epilepsy in children is not widely reported. Methods: We reviewed eight children who underwent SEEG as part of pre-surgical evaluation for MRI negative epilepsy at King?s College Hospital from 2016 to 2018. Results: The median age at time of SEEG was 16 (range 9?17). The median age at epilepsy onset was 5 years (range 4?12) and duration of epilepsy was 9 years (4?13). In all patients, concordance between semiology, video telemetry and PET established a region of interest. The regions of interest were right frontalcentral (1), right frontaltemporal (1), left frontal (1), left parietal (2), left temporal (1), left temporalparietal (1), left perisylvianinsulaoperculum (1). The mean number of electrodes was 11 (range 8?15). All implantations targeted the PET abnormality and adjacent areas to distinguish onset versus spread of seizures, map function, and delineate surgical resection. SEEG identified focal onset in 6 patients (75%) and surgical resection was offered. Resections consisted of frontal (2), parietal (1), frontal operculum (1) and temporal lobectomy (2). Intraoperative electrocorticography was used in 5 patients. The median follow-up is 4 months (range 4?18). The outcomes were Engel 1 (4), Engel 3a (2). Histology showed FCD type 2 in one patient and non-specific changes in all others. Conclusions: SEEG is helpful in selected children to facilitate surgical resection in MRI negative epilepsy. Patient selection, implantation strategy and resection strategy require careful consideration in this patient group. The various factors that lead to a good or poor outcome in individual patients require further detailed study and are difficult to evaluate in population studies.; Introduction: Ictal body image disturbance, or asomatognosia, is rarely described in the literature. Methods: We present the case of a 70-year old, otherwise healthy right-handed lady with ictal asomatognosia as a feature of her longstanding drug-resistant epilepsy. Results: The patient had two distinct seizure types which occurred daily. The first consisted of brief episodes of right, then bilateral upper limb automatisms with loss of awareness. The second type involved a sudden and brief distortion of bodily perception such that she would perceive her face to be on the right of where it should be, or that her head is detached from the rest of her body. This occurred with preservation of awareness and there was no visual distortion of objects around her. Scalp telemetry showed a right parietal seizure onset for both seizure types, and interictal epileptiform discharges and runs of fast activity over the same regions. MRI revealed focal cortical thickening and blurring of grey-white matter junction in the right parietal lobe with abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity tapering toward the right lateral ventricle. SEEG recordings confirmed the seizure onset zone within the lesion, and low current electrical stimulation within the lesion elicited both seizure types. The patient underwent image guided resection of the lesion and remains seizure free. The histology showed cortical dysplasia type 2B. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that ictal asomatognosia can arise from disruption of the non-dominant parietal lobe and its connections, which are thought to mediate a heteromodal representation of one?s own body in space.; Objective: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of non-progressive motor disorders with a prevalence of 2?3 per 1000 live births and approximately 10% or less of them suffer from the subtype called Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy. Dyskinetic CP is characterised by abnormal, involuntary and uncontrolled movements. Advances in neuroimaging have expanded our knowledge of the pathophysiology surrounding CP. However, there still seems to be a paucity of studies using newer neuroimaging techniques to study dyskinetic CP. For a cohort of dyskinetic CP children, we aimed to the study the white matter pathways and correlate them with clinical function, measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Methods: 30 children with dyskinetic CP (mean age =9.8 years) were enrolled and classified between GMFCS levels II-V (mean =3.9). All images, acquired on a 1.5T MRI scanner (Achieva, Phillips), had undergone pre-processing before we ran a tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) analysis. Next, we used diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to study the corticospinal tracts (CST) and the thalami-cortical tracts and extracted the anisotropic metrics to correlate with GMFCS levels. Results: The TBSS analysis produced a significant negative correlation between GMFCS levels and the fractional anisotropy (FA), with correlations noted in the supratentorial white matter with relative sparring of the corticospinal tracts. With the tract-based analysis, we did not find a significant relationship between GMFCS levels and white matter volumetric changes, FA and mean diffusivity (MD). Conclusion: The increased sensitivity of the TBSS analysis allowed us to demonstrate a relationship that we could not reproduce with tract-based measures. This may reflect the focal nature of the white matter changes that cannot be demonstrated with a small-sized study involving a less sensitive tract-based technique. We put forth that there is a more significant thalamo-cortical involvement with relative sparing of the cortocospinal tract in these patients.; Introduction: There is well-reported efficacy of globus pallius interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) for idiopathic generalised dystonia, but the outcomes in the treatment of secondary dystonias have been variable. There is emerging evidence that stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may be beneficial in some cases of dystonia. We report our experience in three patients with medically refractory post-infarct hemidystonia treated with STN DBS. Methods: Prospectively collected data on demographics, clinical outcomes, Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) and complications were analysed. Results: All patients had abnormal GPi on imaging leading to the use of STN as the target. Two patients had unilateral electrodes implanted, and the third patient had bilateral electrodes implanted. At 2 years post-surgery, there was a modest improvement in the BFMDRS score, but significant improvements in pain and comfort levels were achieved, leading to improved quality of life. One patient required electrode revision after sustaining local trauma, and there were no infections. Conclusion: The subthalamic nucleus is a viable target for the treatment of hemidystonia in selected cases and should be considered as an alternative target to the globus pallidus.; Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for movement disorders. We have previously shown that the majority of adult patients prefer fixed-life implantable pulse generators (IPG), although rechargeable batteries are increasingly used. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients? long-term satisfaction with their choice of battery and factors that influence their decision. Methods: 24 adult patients with movement disorders attending the DBS clinic postoperatively completed a questionnaire on long-term satisfaction and experience with the type of battery they had chosen. Results: Twenty patients completed the survey. The mean age was 67.7???7.3 years (range 47?82 years) and 85% (1720) were male. The mean follow-up interval was 18.0???7.2 months (range 9?29 months). The indications for DBS were Parkinson?s disease (75%, 1520), tremor (15%, 320) and dystonia (10%, 220). All patients had bilateral surgery and the targets were the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (65%, 1320), the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) (25%, 520), and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) (10%, 220). Ten patients (50%) had chosen the rechargeable battery. All patients were still happy with their choices and would not change the type of battery if they had the chance to do so. However, in patients who chose the fixed life battery, concern about the size of battery rose from 10 to 50% and concern about the need to have further surgery to replace the battery rose from 10 to 30%. In patients who chose the rechargeable battery, concern about the need to recharge the battery did not change postoperatively. In this group, the ideal charging frequency rated preoperatively was daily (40%), weekly (20%), whereas postoperatively it was daily (0%), weekly (60%), but the actual charging frequency was daily (20%), weekly (40%), suggesting that patients prefer a longer charging interval and adjust their recharging interval accordingly. 50% of patients who chose the rechargeable battery stated that they forget to recharge their mobile phones, but this did not correlate with forgetting to recharge their IPGs. Recharging seems to become easily integrated in patients? daily routine. Interestingly, even though the main reason cited for choosing the fixed-life battery was the convenience and concern about forgetting to recharge the battery, patients who had chosen a rechargeable IPG did not experience this problem. Conclusion: Patients and caregivers should be involved in the choice of battery, as each type of IPG has its own advantages and disadvantages. Long-term evaluation of patient?s experience and satisfaction with battery of choice revealed that size of the IPG, need for further replacement surgeries and need for recharging remain matters of major concern post-surgery. Although preoperatively often underestimated, the size of the battery seems to be an important factor in long-term satisfaction, whereas the need for recharging becomes usually fully integrated in patient?s routine.; Introduction: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) has become a popular, and potentially more efficacious, alternative modality to spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. The mechanisms underlying pain relief from this method of neuromodulation have largely been suggested to mediate decreased neuronal excitability in the peripheral nervous system. The aim of our study is to investigate using magnetoencephalography (MEG) the cerebral changes that occur in response to DRGS and how these patterns reflect the subjective pain experience. Methods: Sixteen patients with medically refractory chronic pain syndromes who had undergone surgical implantation of DRG stimulators at the John Radcliffe Hospital were recruited for the study. Informed consent was obtained, and MEG Recordings were performed at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA) using a 306-channel Elekta Neuromag MEG system comprised of 102 magnetometers and 204 planar gradiometers at a sampling rate of 1000?Hz. Patients were sat upright in a magnetically-shielded room and scanned at rest with eyes fixed on a cross for 8?minutes while the stimulator was on. The stimulator was then turned off and a washout period of 10?minutes elapsed prior to MEG recordings during the off condition. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded before and after onset of DRGS. Raw MEG recordings were MaxFiltered to remove any artefact of stimulation and power spectral analysis conducted offline in Matlab using the Fieldtrip toolbox. Statistical significance across groups was tested using two-way ANOVA with Tukey?s multiple comparison post-hoc tests. Results: Of the sixteen patients recruited, three were excluded due to unacceptable artefact in MEG recordings which would preclude reliable signal analysis. Among all participants the mean change in VAS in response to DRG stimulation was 21%. Two participants exhibited posturalmobility-associated pain, and so experienced no pain during MEG recordings, while two participants reported increase in pain scores during the ON stimulation condition. Patients were categorized as no pain (VAS =0), mild pain (VAS ?5), moderate pain (VAS =5?8) or severe pain (VAS >8). At rest, significant increases (p?<?0.01) in mean theta (4?7?Hz) power and significant decreases in mean alpha power (p?<?0.05) were observed in increasing pain categories. This shift towards lower frequencies at rest was contrasted by a shift towards higher frequencies (low beta 13?20?Hz activity) in response to pain relief. A significant correlation (Pearson?s correlation r?=?0.7 p?<?0.05) was found between the increase in low beta activity and the degree of pain relief.; PU; PI; PA

N2  -  Between March 2009 and January 2010, 36 patients with 38 supratentorial cavernous malformations in eloquent brain areas underwent surgery with the aid of intraoperative MRI (iMRI), functional neuronavigation, and electrocorticography (ECoG). To optimize outcomes, the hemosiderin-stained tissue surrounding the lesion in addition to the cavernous malformation itself (lesion) was microsurgically removed, leaving behind only small areas adjacent to, or overlapping with, functional areas. According to the Zabramski classification, there were 13 type I lesions, which all underwent total resection. There were 25 type II or III lesions with a surrounding hypointense rim, and all of these lesions were completely removed; the surrounding hypointense rims were completely removed in 15 patients and partially removed in 10. No new neurologic disorders occurred postoperatively. Twenty patients had preoperative epileptic seizures, nine of whom were refractory to treatment. During follow-up, seizure outcome was assessed using the Engel classification, and 11 patients with non-refractory epilepsy had a class I outcome. Of the nine patients with refractory epilepsy, seven (77.8%) had a class I outcome, one (11.1%) had a class II outcome, and one (11.1%) had a class III outcome. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  How does the human brain's structural scaffold give rise to its intricate functional dynamics? This is a central question in translational neuroscience that is particularly relevant to epilepsy, a disorder affecting over 50 million subjects worldwide. Treatment for medication-resistant focal epilepsy is often structural-through surgery or laser ablation-but structural targets, particularly in patients without clear lesions, are largely based on functional mapping via intracranial EEG. Unfortunately, the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the seizing brain is poorly understood. In this study, we quantify structure-function coupling, specifically between white matter connections and intracranial EEG, across pre-ictal and ictal periods in 45 seizures from nine patients with unilateral drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We use high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography to construct structural connectivity networks and correlate these networks with time-varying broadband and frequency-specific functional networks derived from coregistered intracranial EEG. Across all frequency bands, we find significant increases in structure-function coupling from pre-ictal to ictal periods. We demonstrate that short-range structural connections are primarily responsible for this increase in coupling. Finally, we find that spatiotemporal patterns of structure-function coupling are highly stereotyped for each patient. These results suggest that seizures harness the underlying structural connectome as they propagate. Mapping the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in epilepsy may inform new therapies to halt seizure spread, and pave the way for targeted patient-specific interventions.

N2  -  Maximal safe resection is the cornerstone of treatment for low-grade and high-grade gliomas. In addition to high-resolution anatomic MRI studies that highlight tumor architecture, it is important to determine the relationship of the tumor to the eloquent cortical and subcortical areas to avoid introducing or exacerbating a neurologic deficit. The goal of this article was to highlight imaging modalities that provide functional information and can be integrated with intraoperative MRI navigation to maximize the extent of resection while preserving a patient's neurologic function.

N2  -  Temporoinsular gliomas are frequently large-sized tumors that require meticulous planning to ensure maximum surgical resection and minimal neurologic deficits in patients. Here, we demonstrate our technique encompassing multi-modal imaging guidance and awake brain mapping which enables maximum safe resection of such tumors.
The patient, a 39-yr-oldman, presented with depression and memory loss for 18 mo. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens) revealed a nonenhancing lesion in the left dominant temporoinsular lobe. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the cholineN-acetyl-aspartate index which suggested a low-grade glioma diagnosis. Informed patient consent was obtained.; After craniotomy, the mouth motor, speech arrest, and word generation areas were mapped via direct cortical stimulation under awake mapping. A strip electrode was placed across the precentral gyrus for continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. Cortical incisions were made in nonfunctional cortical areas and tumor was resected in the temporal lobe. Following this, tumor at the inferior insular zone was carefully debunked with Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (Integra Lifescience) also through the temporal window. The hippocampus was preserved since it was not invaded by tumor. Subcortical mapping combined with Diffuse Tensor Imaging tractography-based navigation (Medtronic lnc.) was performed to localize the motor and language pathways. Intraoperative MRI evaluation showed tumor resection extent of 95%. Pathological and molecular analysis revealed a diagnosis of Grade II IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma. After surgery the patient was administered chemotherapy (Temozolomide). He recovered without language or motor deficits.

N2  -  Different colors of visible light penetrate to varying depths in tissue due to the wavelength dependence of tissue optical absorption and elastic scattering. We exploit this to map the contour of the closest surface of a buried fluorescent object. This uses a novel algorithm based on the diffusion theory description of light propagation in tissue at each excitation wavelength to derive metrics that define the depth of the top surface of the object. The algorithm was validated using a tissue-simulating phantom. It was then demonstrated in vivo by subsurface brain tumor topography in a rodent model, using the fluorescence signal from protoporphyrin IX that is preferentially synthesized within malignant cells following systemic application of aminolevulinic acid. Comparisons to histomorphometry in the brain post mortem show the spatial accuracy of the technique. This method has potential for fluorescence image-guided tumor surgery, as well as other biomedical and nonbiological applications in subsurface sensing.

N2  -  Brainstem gliomas are a heterogeneous group of lesions that account for 15% of all pediatric tumors of the central nervous system. Diagnosis and treatment planning for these tumors is based on the observation of Epstein and Fanner that the growth of lesions with low malignant potential is limited by the anatomical structures of the brainstem. Surgery is offered only to those patients with a high probability of harboring a low-grade tumor, because the attendant risk for significant morbidity outweighs the therapeutic benefit of debulking the tumor in cases of high-grade tumors.
The authors report two cases that highlight the potential of diffusion tensor (DT) imaging to identify local white matter tracts in the pons, medulla, and cervical cord and to improve the preoperative assessment of low-grade gliomas. Preoperative DT imaging in both cases demonstrated that the white matter tracts were displaced by the bulk of the low-grade tumors but were structurally preserved. Intraoperative and neurological findings were consistent with the preoperative interpretation of the DT images. These cases demonstrate that DT imaging is a useful method for visualizing the relationship between tumor and normal brainstem white matter architecture, as well as for improving the surgical evaluation and management of pediatric brainstem tumors.

N2  -  IMPORTANCE Approximately 10% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have symptoms that are refractory to pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral therapies. Neurosurgical interventions can be effective therapeutic options in these patients, but not all individuals respond. The mechanisms underlying this response variability are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE To identify neuroanatomical characteristics on preoperative imaging that differentiate responders from nonresponders to dorsal anterior cingulotomy, a neurosurgical lesion procedure used to treat refractory OCD.; DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We retrospectively analyzed preoperative T1 and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging sequences from 15 patients (9 men and 6 women) who underwent dorsal anterior cingulotomy. Eight of the 15 patients (53%) responded to the procedure.; MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging to identify structural and connectivity variations that could differentiate eventual responders from nonresponders. The VBM and probabilistic tractography metrics were correlated with clinical response to the cingulotomy procedure as measured by changes in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score.; RESULTS Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed a gray matter cluster in the right anterior cingulate cortex, anterior to the eventual lesion, for which signal strength correlated with poor response (P = .017). Decreased gray matter in this region of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex predicted improved response (mean SD gray matter partial volume for responders vs nonresponders, 0.47 0.03 vs 0.66 0.03; corresponding to mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score change, -60%19 vs -11% 9, respectively). Hemispheric asymmetry in connectivity between the eventual lesion and the caudate (for responders vs nonresponders, mean SD group laterality for individual lesion seeds, -0.79 0.18 vs -0.08 0.65; P = .04), putamen (-0.55 0.35 vs 0.50 0.33; P = .001), thalamus (-0.82 0.19 vs 0.41 0.24; P = .001), pallidum (-0.78 0.18 vs 0.43 0.48; P = .001), and hippocampus (-0.66 0.33 vs 0.33 0.18; P = .001) also correlated significantly with clinical response, with increased right-sided connectivity predicting greater response.; CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We identified features of anterior cingulate cortex structure and connectivity that predict clinical response to dorsal anterior cingulotomy for refractory OCD. These results suggest that the variability seen in individual responses to a highly consistent, stereotyped procedure may be due to neuroanatomical variation in the patients. Furthermore, these variations may allow us to predict which patients are most likely to respond to cingulotomy, thereby refining our ability to individualize this treatment for refractory psychiatric disorders.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the impact of augmented reality intraoperative fiber tractography (AR-iFT) on extent of resection (EOR), motor functional outcome, and survival of patients with primary motor area (M1) intra-axial malignant tumors. METHODS Data obtained from patients who underwent AR-iFT for M1 primary tumors were retrospectively analyzed and compared with those from a control group who underwent unaugmented reality intraoperative fiber tractography (unAR-iFT). A full asleep procedure with electrical stimulation mapping and fluorescein guidance was performed in both groups. The Neurological Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO), Medical Research Council (MRC), and House-Brackmann grading systems were used for neurological, motor, and facial nerve assessment, respectively. Three-month postoperative NANO and MRC scores were used as outcome measures of the safety of the technique, whereas EOR and survival curves were related to its cytoreductive efficacy. In this study, p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS This study included 34 and 31 patients in the AR-iFT and unAR-iFT groups, respectively. The intraoperative seizure rate, 3-month postoperative NANO score, and 1-week and 1-month MRC scores were significantly (p < 0.05) different and in favor of the AR-iFT group. However, no difference was observed in the rate of complications. Glioma had incidence rates of 58.9% and 51.7% in the study and control groups, respectively, with no statistical difference. Metasta- sis had a slightly higher incidence rate in the control group, without statistical significance, and the gross-total resection and near-total resection rates and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were higher in the study group. Overall survival was not affected by the technique. CONCLUSIONS AR-iFT proved to be feasible, effective, and safe during surgery for M1 tumors and positively affected the EOR, intraoperative seizure rate, motor outcome, and PFS. Integration with electrical stimulation mapping is criti-cal to achieve constant anatomo-functional intraoperative feedback. The accuracy of AR-iFT is intrinsically limited by diffusion tensor-based techniques, parallax error, and fiber tract crowding. Further studies are warranted to definitively validate the benefits of augmented reality navigation in this surgical scenario.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The critical role of different adjuncts in improving the neurological outcome in intrinsic brain le-sions affecting eloquent areas is demonstrated by their more diffuse utilization. Neurosurgeons often rely on pre-operative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography to improve the operative strategy and prog-nosis. We aimed to identify and validate a diffusion tensor imaging-based classification considering the relationship between the brain lesion and the corticospinal tract to predict a >50% reduction of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during surgical excision of lesions involving the motor pathways. -METHODS: We included patients consecutively enrolled at our institution between April 2020 and September 2022 with 3 patterns of increasing complexity according to the relationship between the lesion and the corticospinal tract as identified on preoperative diffusion tensor imaging. Outcome measures were >50% reduction in intraoperative MEPs and neurological outcome defined as unchanged, improved, or worsened.RESULTS: The study included 83 patients. A statistically significant linear trend between higher rates of reduction of MEPs and higher classification grades was observed (P = 0.001), with sensitivity 0.60, specificity 0.88, accuracy 0.83, and area under the curve 0.75. Higher grades were associated with worse neurological outcomes (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: The classification proved reliable in anticipating reduction in intraoperative MEPs and in predicting neurological outcome. Using this classification in patients undergoing surgery for lesions involving the motor pathways could help in counseling the patient, sur-gical planning, enhancing teamwork of operating room personnel, and improving the patient's prognosis.

N2  -  We herein report the case of a 53-year-old woman with Behcet's disease and an acute T2-hyperintense lesion in left side of the pons. Echo-planar "trace" diffusion MR imaging revealed high signal intensity changes at the lesion site on b = 1000 s/mm(2) images, initially suggesting restricted diffusion. On corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps, however, the lesion had high signal intensity and high apparent diffusion coefficient values (1.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), compared with the contralateral normal side of the pons (0.86 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and compared with the normal temporal white matter (0.80 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). This was consistent with the presence of increased diffusion, hence vasogenic edema. Proton MR spectroscopy excluded acute infarction. This particular pattern (high signal intensity on b = 1000 s/mm(2) images in association with high apparent diffusion coefficient values) likely represented the acute inflammatory process associated with disrupted brain-blood barrier in the fulminant form of neuro-Behcet's disease. Follow-up examinations less than or equal to2 years later revealed a remaining gliotic lesion.

Purpose To validate the generalization ability of radiomics models based on multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) for differentiating PCNSL from GBM. Study Type Retrospective. Population In all, 240 patients with GBM (n= 129) or PCNSL (n= 111). Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T scanners (two vendors). Sequences: fluid-attenuation inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI). Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were derived from DWI. Assessment Cross-vendor and mixed-vendor validation were conducted. In cross-vendor validation, the training set was 149 patients' data from vendor 1, and test set was 91 patients' data from vendor 2. In mixed-vendor validation, a training set was 80% of data from both vendors, and the test set remained at 20% of data. Single and multisequence radiomics models were built. The diagnoses by radiologists with 5, 10, and 20 years' experience were obtained. The integrated models were built combining the diagnoses by the best-performing radiomics model and each radiologist. Model performance was validated in the test set using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Histological results were used as the reference standard. Statistical Tests DeLong test: differences between AUCs.U-test: differences of numerical variables. Fisher's exact test: differences of categorical variables. Results In cross-vendor and mixed-vendor validation, the combination of CE-T1WI and ADC produced the best-performing radiomics model, with AUC of 0.943 vs. 0.935,P= 0.854. The integrated models had higher AUCs than radiologists, with 5 (0.975 vs. 0.891,P= 0.002 and 0.995 vs. 0.885,P= 0.007), 10 (0.975 vs. 0.913,P= 0.029 and 0.995 vs. 0.900,P= 0.030), and 20 (0.975 vs. 0.945,P= 0.179 and 0.995 vs. 0.923,P= 0.046) years' experiences. Data Conclusion Radiomics for differentiating PCNSL from GBM was generalizable. The model combining MP-MRI and radiologists' diagnoses had superior performance compared to the radiologists alone.

N2  -  Background Preoperative differentiation of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and solitary brain metastasis (SBM) contributes to guide neurosurgical decision-making. Purpose To explore the value of histogram analysis based on neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in differentiating between GBM and SBM and comparison of the diagnostic performance of two region of interest (ROI) placements. Study Type Retrospective. Population In all, 109 patients with GBM (n = 57) or SBM (n = 52) were enrolled. Field Strength/Sequence A 3.0 T scanners. T-2-dark-fluid sequence, contrast-enhanced T-1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence, and NODDI. Assessment ROIs were placed on the peritumoral edema area (ROI1) and whole tumor area (ROI2, included the cystic, necrotic, and hemorrhagic areas). Histogram parameters of each isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), and orientation dispersion index (ODI) from NODDI images for two ROIs were calculated, respectively. Statistical Tests Mann-Whitney U test, independent t-test, chi-square test, multivariate logistic regression analysis, DeLong's test. Results For the ROI1 and ROI2, the ICVFmin and ODImean obtained the highest area under curve (AUC, AUC = 0.741 and 0.750, respectively) compared to other single parameters, and the AUC of the multivariate logistic regression model was 0.851 and 0.942, respectively. DeLong's test revealed significant difference in diagnostic performance between optimal single parameter and multivariate logistic regression model within the same ROI, and the multivariate logistic regression models between two different ROIs. Data Conclusion The performance of multivariate logistic regression model is superior to optimal single parameter in both ROIs based on NODDI histogram analysis to distinguish SBM from GBM, and the ROI placed on the whole tumor area exhibited better diagnostic performance.

N2  -  Factors that determine the extent of the penumbra in the initial diagnostic workup using whole brain CT Perfusion (WB-CTP) remain unclear. The purpose of the current study was to determine a possible dependency of the initial mismatch size between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) from time after symptom onset, leptomeningeal collateralization, and occlusion localization in acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions.
Out of an existing cohort of 992 consecutive patients receiving multiparametric CT scans including WB-CTP due to suspected stroke, we included patients who had (1) a witnessed time of symptom onset, (2) an infarction of the MCA territory as documented by follow-up imaging, and (3) an initial CBF volume of > 10 ml. CBF and CBV lesion sizes, collateralization grade, and the site of occlusion were determined.; We included 103 patients. Univariate analysis showed that time from symptom onset (168 +-aEuro parts per thousand 91.2 min) did not correlate with relative or absolute mismatch volumes (p = 0.458 and p = 0.921). Higher collateralization gradings were associated with small absolute mismatch volumes (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions were associated with large absolute mismatch volumes (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed that ICA occlusion was associated with large absolute mismatch volumes (p = 0.005), and high collateral grade was associated with small absolute mismatch volumes (p = 0.017).; There is no significant correlation between initial CTP mismatch and time after symptom onset. Predictors of mismatch size include the extent of the collaterals and a proximal location of the occlusion.

N2  -  Visual input has a profound effect on the developmet of binocular maps in the tectum of the frog Xenopus laevis. Input from the ipsilateral eye, which is relayed to the tectum via the opposite nucleus isthmi, is normally in register with the retinotectal map from the contralateral eye. However, if one eye is rotated during larval stages while the other eye is left in normal orientation, then the resulting mismatched visual input induces the crossed isthmotectal axons to change their  trajectories and to establish a reoriented ipsilateral visuotectal map in register with the contralateral retinotectal map. The major cue which aligns the two maps is the correlation of visually-evoked activity from the two eyes. This experiment was designed to determine whether the uncrossed isthmotectal projection is necessary to organize the map transmitted by the crossed isthmotectal axons. Each NI receives a topographic map from the tectum on the same side of the brain and therefore carries the same topographic information as the retinotectal projection, and each NI transmits that map not only to the opposite tectum but also back to the same tectum from which it received its input. Thus, the uncrossed isthmotectal axons provide each tectum with a map which is essentially topographically identical to the retinotectal map but which is slightly delayed temporally. The uncrossed isthmotectal axons therefore could provide topographic cues to the guide the alignment of the  crossed isthmotectal axons as they establish the ipsilateral visuotectal map. In order to determine whether the uncrossed isthmotectal projection is an important source of topographic cues for the crossed isthmotectal axons, the right nucleus isthmi was ablated and one eye was rotated by 90.degree.-150.degree. in midlarval tadpoles. At 23-63 weeks post-metamorphosis, the binocular projections to the right tectum were mapped electrophysiologically. In 7 of the 8 frogs with lesions of at least 44% of the  nucleus isthmi, the ipsilateral map was aligned with the contralateral map. Thus, the crossed isthmotectal fibers, which relay the ipsilateral visuotectal projection, do not require the presence of the uncrossed isthmotectal axons in order to form a map in alignment with the contralateral retinotectal projection.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate if T2*-weighted dynamic susceptibility-weighted first-pass perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is feasible at 3.0 T and which dose of contrast agent is suitable for high-field-strength imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was obtained from all participants; study protocol was approved by the institutional review board. Study included three volunteers (two men, one woman aged 35, 39, and 52 years) and 26 patients (mean age, 49 years +- 12.8 standard deviation; range, 19-76 years). Volunteers underwent 3.0-T perfusion MR imaging with 0.20, 0.10, and 0.05 mmol per kilogram body weight of gadopentetate dimeglumine; patients underwent imaging with 0.10- and 0.05-mmol doses. Perfusion MR imaging was performed with three-dimensional echo-shifted echo-planar imaging (repetition time msececho time msec, 1421; isotropic 4 mm(3) voxels; 50 dynamic volumes with 30 sections each, covering entire brain at temporal resolution of 1.5 seconds per MR image). Quality of source echo-planar images and perfusion maps was assessed; perfusion maps obtained at studies with different contrast media doses were compared. Quantitative perfusion values and diagnostic sensitivity of perfusion studies with 0.10-mmol dose were compared with results with 0.05-mmol dose. Image quality scores were compared with marginal homogeneity test for multinomial variables (Mantel-Haenszel statistics for ordered categorized values). Signal-to-noise ratio and baseline signal intensity in perfusion studies were tested (Student t test for paired samples). Mean transit time (MTT), negative integral (NI), and maximum T2* effect from region-of-interest analysis were compared (one-tailed Student t test for paired samples). Quantitative data on number of gamma-fitted pixels were compared (t test for paired samples). Difference with P = .05 (t test for paired samples) was considered significant.; RESULTS: Perfusion image quality was satisfactory even in areas close to skull base (47 of 52 images, minor distortions; remaining images, marked distortions). Perfusion imaging with 0.20-mmol dose caused almost complete signal cancellation during first pass, particularly in cortical gray matter, since mean maximum T2* effect of 98%, 99%, and 98% for gray matter was reached such that the accurate calculation of perfusion maps was impossible. With 0.10-mmol dose, the NI and maximum T2* effect were comparable to published data for 1.5-T perfusion imaging with 0.20- and 0.05-mmol doses, perfusion maps of sufficient diagnostic quality were obtained. For gray matter, mean maximum T2* effect was 25.4% +- 9.8 with 0.10-mmol dose and 17.5% +- 9.0 with 0.05-mmol dose. For white matter, mean maximum T2* effect was 15.2% +- 4.5 with 0.10-mmol dose and 7.7% +- 2.9 with 0.05-mmol dose. Difference in maximum signal intensity decrease was significant (P < .01). For NI, the difference between 0.10- and 0.05-mmol doses was significant: For gray matter, mean NI was 3.1 +- 1.60 for 0.10-mmol dose and 1.56 +- 1.16 for 0.05-mmol dose. For white matter, mean NI was 1.35 +- 0.59 with 0.1-mmol dose and 0.59 +- 0.30 with 0.05-mmol dose.; CONCLUSION: With echo-shifted multishot echo-planar imaging, dynamic susceptibility-weighted perfusion MR imaging at high field strength is feasible without relevant image distortions. Compared with contrast agent dose for 1.5 T imaging, the dose for 3.0 T can be reduced to 0.10 mmol. (C) RSNA, 2005.

N2  -  Interstitial laser therapy (ILT) is a promising therapeutic technique in which laser energy is delivered percutaneously to various depths in tissue. In this study, the authors compared high-speed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of ILT in tissues during treatment with post-treatment histopathologic specimens. The use of 5-second MRI scans allowed detection of thermal damage by the 1064-nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser in ex vivo liver and brain tissues. These tissues were treated by ILT with 20 W of laser output for 5 to 30 seconds via a 600-mu m fiberoptic inserted 1 cm into the specimens at a power density of 7 kW/cm(2) at the tip of the bare fiber.
Sequential MRI measurements of lesion areas made during and after treatment were compared to measurements of laser-induced tissue damage in histolopathologic sections. Fast MRI scans and tissue histology both demonstrated increased lesion size with time of ILT. Serial images obtained during ILT detected thermal changes as areas of low signal intensity that exceeded the size of the post-treatment lesions as measured on either final MRI or histology. The thermal effects detectable by these high-speed MRI sequences can be used to monitor laser-induced tissue changes during therapy, thereby providing a valuable noninvasive method for the intraoperative assessment of heat distribution during ILT.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A new FPCT application offers the possibility of perfusion (FPCT CBV) and parenchymal (FPCT) imaging within the angiography suite. We tested the hypothesis that findings in FPCT CBV and FPCT would correlate with those obtained using MSCT and PCT. MATERIALS AND
METHODS: In 16 patients with acute MCA occlusion, FPCT CBV was performed immediately posttreatment. The volume of tissue having abnormal CBV values was determined by FPCT CBV and PCT images. Stroke volume on follow-up MSCT was determined, CBV values in the effected parenchyma were measured, and FPCT images were reviewed.; RESULTS: In 6 cases, we found a FPCT CBV value identical or higher (hyperemia) in comparison with the contralateral side. In 10 cases, we found CBV lesions with values lower (oligemia) than the contralateral brain tissue. We found a high correlation of CBV lesion volume on FPCT CBV images to stroke volume on follow-up MSCT (r = 0.9, P < .05) in the oligemia group. Absolute FPCT CBV and PCT CBV values were comparable and showed good correlation (r = 0.9, P < .05). In 8 patients, contrast medium extravasation was visible.; CONCLUSIONS: The new FPCT application allows assessment of CBV in acute stroke patients. Our initial results indicate that these measurements may predict final infarct volume. The ability to assess this key parameter of cerebral perfusion within the angiographic suite may improve the management of these patients.

N2  -  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the relationship between TBI and PTSD is not well understood. We present the case of a 31-year-old male veteran with PTSD who reported TBI before entering the military. The reported injury appeared to be mild: He was struck on the head by a baseball, losing consciousness for similar to 10 seconds. Years later, he developed severe PTSD after combat exposure. He was not receiving clinical services for these issues but was encountered in the context of a research study. We conducted cognitive, autonomic, and MRI assessments to assess brain function, structure, and neurophysiology. Next, we compared amygdala volume, uncinate fasciculus diffusion, functional connectivity, facial affect recognition, and baroreceptor coherence with those of a control group of combat veterans (n = 23). Our veteran's MRI revealed a large right medial-orbital prefrontal lesion with surrounding atrophy, which the study neuroradiologist interpreted as likely caused by traumatic injury. Comparison with controls indicated disrupted structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal-limbic structures and impaired emotional, cognitive, and autonomic responses. Detection of this injury before combat would have been unlikely in a clinical context because our veteran had reported a phenomenologically mild injury, and PTSD is a simple explanation for substance abuse, sleep impairment, and psychosocial distress. However, it may be that right prefrontal-limbic disruption imparted vulnerability for the development of PTSD and exacerbated our veteran's emotional response to, and recovery from, PTSD.

N2  -  Surgical resection of brain tumors is challenging because of the delicate balance between maximizing tumor removal and preserving vital brain functions. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers noninvasive preoperative mapping of widely distributed brain areas and is increasingly used in presurgical functional mapping. However, its impact on survival and functional outcomes is still not well-supported by evidence. Task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) maps blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during specific tasks, while resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) examines spontaneous brain activity. rs-fMRI may be useful for patients who cannot perform tasks, but its reliability is affected by tumor-induced changes, challenges in data processing, and noise. Validation studies comparing fMRI with direct cortical stimulation (DCS) show variable concordance, particularly for cognitive functions such as language; however, concordance for tb-fMRI is generally greater than that for rs-fMRI. Preoperative fMRI, in combination with MRI tractography and intraoperative DCS, may result in improved survival and extent of resection and reduced functional deficits. fMRI has the potential to guide surgical planning and help identify targets for intraoperative mapping, but there is currently limited prospective evidence of its impact on patient outcomes. This review describes the current state of fMRI for preoperative assessment in patients undergoing brain tumor resection. (c) RSNA, 2023

N2  -  Background: The integrity of the motor system can be examined by applying navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) to the cortex. The corresponding motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the target muscles are mirroring the status of the human motor system, far beyond corticospinal integrity. Commonly used time domain features of MEPs (e.g., peak-to-peak amplitudes and onset latencies) exert a high inter-subject and intra-subject variability. Frequency domain analysis might help to resolve or quantify disease-related MEP changes, e.g., in brain tumor patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the time-frequency representation of MEPs in brain tumor patients, its relation to clinical and imaging findings, and the differences to healthy subject.
Methods: This prospective study compared 12 healthy subjects with 12 consecutive brain tumor patients (with and without a paresis) applying nTMS mapping. Resulting MEPs were evaluated in the time series domain (i.e., amplitudes and latencies). After transformation into the frequency domain using a Morlet wavelet approach, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were calculated and compared to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results.; Results: There were no significant differences in the time series characteristics between groups. MEPs were projecting to a frequency band between 30 and 300 Hz with a local maximum around 100 Hz for both healthy subjects and patients. However, there was ERSP reduction for higher frequencies (>100 Hz) in patients in contrast to healthy subjects. This deceleration was mirrored in an increase of the inter-peak MEP latencies. Patients with a paresis showed an additional disturbance in ITC in these frequencies. There was no correlation between the CST integrity (as measured by DTI) and the MEP parameters.; Conclusion: Time-frequency analysis may provide additional information above and beyond classical MEP time domain features and the status of the corticospinal system in brain tumor patients. This first evaluation indicates that brain tumors might affect cortical physiology and the responsiveness of the cortex to TMS resulting in a temporal dispersion of the corticospinal transmission.

N2  -  Resection of motor pathway gliomas requires the intraoperative recognition of essential cortical-subcortical motor structures. The degree of involvement of motor structures is variable, and increases as result of treatments patients are submitted to. Intraoperative neurophysiology offers various stimulation modalities, which efficiency is based on the ability to recognize essential sites with the highest possible resolution in most clinical conditions. Two stimulation paradigms evolved for intraoperative guidance of motor tumors removal: the 60 Hz-technique [low frequency (LF)] and the pulse-technique [high frequency-(HF)], delivered by bipolar or monopolar probe respectively. Most surgical teams rely on to either of the 2 techniques. The key point is the integration of the choice of the stimulation modality with the clinical context.
In 591 tumors involving the corticospinal tract, the use of HF and LF was tailored to the clinical context defined by patient clinical history and tumor features (by imaging). The effect was evaluated on the feasibility of mapping, the impact on immediate and permanent morbidity, the extent of resection, and the number of patients treated.; By integrating the choice of the probe and the stimulation protocol with patient clinical history and tumor characteristics, the best probe-frequency match was identified for the different sets of clinical conditions. This integrative approach allows increasing the extent of resection and patient functional integrity, and greatly expands the number of patients who could benefit from surgery.; The integration of stimulation modalities with clinical context enhances the extent and safety of resection and expands the population of patients who could benefit from surgical treatment.

N2  -  Various subnuclei of the rat thalamus were punched out or finely microdissected from frozen coronal sections of brain and assayed for GABA by microdansylation. Highest levels were recorded in the ventromedial and parafascicular regions, corresponding to the sites of termination of nigrothalamic neurons. One week after placing a unilateral ectrolytic lesion in the zona reticulata of the substantia nigra there were significant decreases in GABA levels in the ipsilateral ventromedial (-14%) and parafascicular (-11%) nuclei, but not in other nuclei tested. Falls in the level of GABA of 19-26% were confined to the ventromedial region in microdissections of brain slices containing this nucleus, 2 wk after injecting 1 .mu.g kainic acid into the substantia nigra. The concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, glycine and alanine were not altered in the deafferented ventromedial thalamus. Pathological effects of kainate were registered as complete loss of neuronal perikarya at the injection site coupled with intense gliosis. Mild gliosis, but not postysynaptic neuronal damage, was visible in the corresponding ventromedial and parafascicular nuclei in the thalamus, although degenerating electron-dense terminal boutons were occasionally seen by EM of this tissue. In rats in which thalamic glutamate decarboxylase activity was inhibited by stemic injection of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, trains of biphasic electrical pulses delivered to the nigra (100 Hz, 0.1 mA, width 0.6 ms for 15 min) evoked a stimulus-dependent decrease in ventromedial (-17%) and parafascicular (-10%) GABA content, but not in that of other thalamic nuclei. Similar post-stimulus falls in the level of GABA in the ventromedial nucleus were noted after direct stereotaxic injection of this nucleus with the enzyme inhibitor. These findings are consistent with the existence of GABA-containing nigrothalamic fibers whose cell bodies lie in the medial part of the substantia nigra zona reticulata and which terminate in the ventromedial and parafascicular nuclear regions of the thalamus.

N2  -  The basal ganglia and substantia nigra, taken from control human brain and from patients dying with a diagnosis of Parkinson''s disease or Huntington''s chorea, were analysed with histochemical and biochemical techniques. The pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta possess tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and are disposed in three major layers, alpha, beta and gamma. This pattern became obscured in choreic brains by the severe shrinkage of the nigra, but total numbers of pigmented neurons were within the normal range. In contrast, pigmented neurons were lost from all layers of the substantia nigra in Parkinson''s disease, although examination of cases with minimal cell loss suggested that an internal part of the lateral alpha sub-layer was most severely and consistenly affected. A dopaminergic projection between this internal part of the alpha sub-layer and the putamen was suggested by the preferential loss of catecholamines from the putamen in Parkinson''s disease. The distribution of the peptides, substances P, methionine-enkephalin and dynorphin 1-17 were mapped immunohistochemically within the substantia nigra. The different patterns of immunoreactive axons and terminals were found to be extensive, at least partially overlapping, and largely avoided the region of the pigmented perikarya of the alpha sub-layer and nucleus paranigralis. All peptides were depleted in choreic substantia nigra, reflecting the degeneration of the striatonigral pathway. However, concentratios of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity were increased within the interpeduncular necleus. In Parkinson''s disease there was a loss of enkephalin- and dynorphin-like immunoreactivity from the substantia nigra but a fall in substance P-like immunoreactivity was only detected by radioimmunoassay, not by immunocytochemisty. Peptide immunoreactivity was also reduced within choreic basal ganglia. However, no gross changes were found in peptide staining of the parkinsons basal ganglia. In summary we have reported a number of changes in peptide-containing pathways in human degenerative disorders that may reflect the degeneration of neuronal pathways either as a primary event or secondary to initial lesion. We have also emphasized the sensivity of the alpha sub-layer of nigral neurons to damage in Parkinson''s disease. We suggest that the lower density of peptidergic fibres in the area of the perikarya may contribute to the susceptibility of these neurons to damage.

N2  -  Resection of gliomas in or close to motor areas is at high risk for morbidity and development of surgery-related deficits. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) including nTMSbased tractography is suitable for presurgical planning and risk assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of postoperative motor status and the spatial relation to motor eloquent brain tissue in order to increase the understanding of postoperative motor deficits. Patient data, nTMS examinations and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed, corticospinal tracts (CST) were reconstructed with two different approaches of nTMS-based seeding. Postoperative imaging and nTMS-augmented preoperative imaging were merged to identify the relation between motor positive cortical and subcortical areas and the resection cavity. 38 tumor surgeries were performed in 36 glioma patients (28.9% female) aged 55.1 +/- 13.8 years. Mean distance between the CST and the lesion was 6.9 +/- 5.1 mm at 75% of the patientindividual fractional anisotropy threshold and median tumor volume reduction was 97.7 +/- 11.6%. The positive predictive value for permanent deficits after resection of nTMS positive areas was 66.7% and the corresponding negative predictive value was 90.6%. Distances between the resection cavity and the CST were higher in patients with postoperative stable motor function. Extent of resection and distance between resection cavity and CST correlated well. The present study strongly supports preoperative nTMS as an important surgical tool for preserving motor function in glioma patients at risk.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. Techniques for the quantitative assessment of neurodegenerative lesions remain to be established in this disease. We attempted to quantify global and region-specific neuro. degeneration in DRPLA using analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.
METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images (b = 1000 smm(2)) by echo-planar sequences were obtained with the use of a 1.5T clinical scanner. Whole-brain histogram and region of interest (ROI) analyses of ADC values as well as conventional MR imaging studies were performed in 6 patients with genetically confirmed DRPLA.; RESULTS: Histograms demonstrated significantly higher mean ADC values in the patients than in age- and sex-matched control subjects (P <.01). 1901 analysis revealed that the patients had significantly higher ADC values in the cerebellum and globus pallidus, preferentially affected regions (P <.05), but not in the thalamus, the region relatively spared in this disease. ADC values in the white matter were higher only in patients with adult-onset disease. Histogram analyses could more sensitively identify abnormalities than ROI analyses, because the former avoided errors associated with setting ROIs and thus had smaller P values on statistical analysis than the latter.; CONCLUSIONS: Histogram ADC analyses were more sensitive for the detection of neurodegeneration in DRPLA than ROI analyses, whereas ROI analyses revealed regional alterations reflecting the distribution of pathologic changes. Thus, histogram and ROI analyses complement each other and may permit the sensitive, quantitative evaluation of neurodegeneration in DRPLA, especially that involving the globus pallidus showing normal T2 signals.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between stroke lesion location and the resulting somatosensory deficit. We studied exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory symptoms and stroke lesions in 38 patients with first-ever acute stroke. The Erasmus modified Nottingham Sensory Assessment was used to clinically evaluate somatosensory functioning in the arm and hand within the first week after stroke onset. Additionally, more objective measures such as the perceptual threshold of touch and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded. Non-parametric voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to investigate lesion contribution to different somatosensory deficits in the upper limb. Additionally, structural connectivity of brain areas that demonstrated the strongest association with somatosensory symptoms was determined, using probabilistic fiber tracking based on diffusion tensor imaging data from a healthy age-matched sample. Voxels with a significant association to somatosensory deficits were clustered in two core brain regions: the central parietal white matter, also referred to as the sensory component of the superior thalamic radiation, and the parietal operculum close to the insular cortex, representing the secondary somatosensory cortex. Our objective recordings confirmed findings from clinical assessments. Probabilistic tracking connected the first region to thalamus, internal capsule, brain stem, postcentral gyrus, cerebellum, and frontal pathways, while the second region demonstrated structural connections to thalamus, insular and primary somatosensory cortex. This study reveals that stroke lesions in the sensory fibers of the superior thalamocortical radiation and the parietal operculum are significantly associated with multiple exteroceptive and proprioceptive deficits in the arm and hand.

N2  -  Brain tumors are one of the major common causes of cancer-related death, worldwide. Growth prediction of these tumors, particularly gliomas which are the most dominant type, can be quite useful to improve treatment planning, quantify tumor aggressiveness, and estimate patients' survival time towards precision medicine. Studying tumor growth prediction basically requires multiple time points of single or multimodal medical images of the same patient. Recent models are based on complex mathematical formulations that basically rely on a system of partial differential equations, e.g. reaction diffusion model, to capture the diffusion and proliferation of tumor cells in the surrounding tissue. However, these models usually have small number of parameters that are insufficient to capture different patterns and other characteristics of the tumors. In addition, such models consider tumor growth independently for each subject, not being able to get benefit from possible common growth patterns existed in the whole population under study. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method via stacked 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), named GP-GAN, for growth prediction of glioma. Specifically, we use stacked conditional GANs with a novel objective function that includes both l1 and Dice losses. Moreover, we use segmented feature maps to guide the generator for better generated images. Our generator is designed based on a modified 3D U-Net architecture with skip connections to combine hierarchical features and thus have a better generated image. The proposed method is trained and tested on 18 subjects with 3 time points (9 subjects from collaborative hospital and 9 subjects from BRATS 2014 dataset). Results show that our proposed GP-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods for glioma growth prediction and attain average Jaccard index and Dice coefficient of 78.97% and 88.26%, respectively.

N2  -  Donepezil (DP), a cognitive-enhancing drug targeting the cholinergic system, combined with massed sentence repetition training augmented and speeded up recovery of speech production deficits in patients with chronic conduction aphasia and extensive left hemisphere infarctions (Berthier et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a still unsettled question is whether such improvements correlate with restorative structural changes in gray matter and white matter pathways mediating speech production. In the present study, we used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to study treatment-induced brain changes in gray matter and white matter tracts in a right-handed male with chronic conduction aphasia and a right subcortical lesion (crossed aphasia). A single-patient, open-label multiple-baseline design incorporating two different treatments and two post-treatment evaluations was used. The patient received an initial dose of DP (5 mg/day) which was maintained during 4 weeks and then titrated up to 10 mg/day and administered alone (without aphasia therapy) during 8 weeks (Endpoint 1). Thereafter, the drug was combined with an audiovisual repetition-imitation therapy (Look-Listen-Repeat, LLR) during 3 months (Endpoint 2). Language evaluations, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed at baseline and at both endpoints in JAM and once in 21 healthy control males. Treatment with DP alone and combined with LLR therapy induced marked improvement in aphasia and communication deficits as well as in selected measures of connected speech production, and phrase repetition. The obtained gains in speech production remained well-above baseline scores even 4 months after ending combined therapy. Longitudinal DWI showed structural plasticity in the right frontal aslant tract and direct segment of the arcuate fasciculus with both interventions. VBM revealed no structural changes in other white matter tracts nor in cortical areas linked by these tracts. In conclusion, cholinergic potentiation alone and combined with a model-based aphasia therapy improved language deficits by promoting structural plastic changes in right white matter tracts.

However, such relationships have not been fully explored for the lower limb. We aimed to test whether variation in walking impairment was associated with variation in the structural or functional integrity of the CST.
Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to stimulate each motor cortex while EMG recordings were taken from the vastus lateralis (VL) bilaterally; these EMG measures were used to calculate both ipsilateral and contralateral recruitment curves for each lower limb. The slope of these recruitment curves was used to examine the strength of functional connectivity from the motor cortex in each hemisphere to the lower limbs in chronic stroke patients and to calculate a ratio between ipsilateral and contralateral outputs referred to as the functional connectivity ratio (FCR). The structural integrity of the CST was assessed using diffusion tensor MRI to measure the asymmetry in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the internal capsule. Lower limb impairment and walking speed were also measured.; Results: The FCR for the paretic leg correlated with walking impairment, such that greater relative ipsilateral connectivity was associated with slower walking speeds. Asymmetrical FA values, reflecting reduced structural integrity of the lesioned CST, were associated with greater walking impairment. FCR and FA asymmetry were strongly positively correlated with each other.; Conclusions: Patients with relatively greater ipsilateral connectivity between the contralesional motor cortex and the paretic lower limb were more behaviorally impaired and had more structural damage to their ipsilesional hemisphere CST.; Significance: Measures of structural and functional damage may be useful in the selection of therapeutic strategies, allowing for more tailored and potentially more beneficial treatments.

N2  -  Simple Summary Several advantages of molecular imaging, namely, positron emission tomography (PET), have been already described in different settings of glioma management. Particularly, the use of amino acidic radiotracers for PET imaging has gained favor for their added value in diagnosis, grading, guidance, and response to treatment and in order to rule out recurrences. Despite the meaning of the biologically active volume of the tumor, a PET-integrated resection of adult-type diffuse high-grade gliomas is not routinely performed, but it can represent a further perspective for neurosurgeons. A systematic review of the literature has been performed to investigate this topic with a precise focus on the neurosurgeon's point of view presented, examining the reasons of its limited use in surgical practice and possible applications. Amino acid PET imaging has been used for a few years in the clinical and surgical management of gliomas with satisfactory results in diagnosis and grading for surgical and radiotherapy planning and to differentiate recurrences. Biological tumor volume (BTV) provides more meaningful information than standard MR imaging alone and often exceeds the boundary of the contrast-enhanced nodule seen in MRI. Since a gross total resection reflects the resection of the contrast-enhanced nodule and the majority of recurrences are at a tumor's margins, an integration of PET imaging during resection could increase PFS and OS. A systematic review of the literature searching for "PET" [All fields] AND "glioma" [All fields] AND "resection" [All fields] was performed in order to investigate the diffusion of integration of PET imaging in surgical practice. Integration in a neuronavigation system and intraoperative use of PET imaging in the primary diagnosis of adult high-grade gliomas were among the criteria for article selection. Only one study has satisfied the inclusion criteria, and a few more (13) have declared to use multimodal imaging techniques with the integration of PET imaging to intentionally perform a biopsy of the PET uptake area. Despite few pieces of evidence, targeting a biologically active area in addition to other tools, which can help intraoperatively the neurosurgeon to increase the amount of resected tumor, has the potential to provide incremental and complementary information in the management of brain gliomas. Since supramaximal resection based on the extent of MRI FLAIR hyperintensity resulted in an advantage in terms of PFS and OS, PET-based biological tumor volume, avoiding new neurological deficits, deserves further investigation.

N2  -  Objectives: Meningioma is one of the most common primary intracranial tumors. Diagnosis by imaging is not difficult. However evaluation of tumor consistency is an important factor affecting the surgical outcomes. The purpose of our study is to discover the relationship of different findings on pre-operative MRI, with a focus on detailed architectures, and different degrees of infra-operative stiffness of meningioma. Consistency of meningioma is also analyzed in compression to semi-quantitative pathological grading of fibrosis.
Patients and Methods: Sixty patients who underwent pre-operative MRI and primary surgery at our hospital were included in prospective fashion. Pre-operative MRI parameters, including general data and detailed internal architectures, were recorded. Intra-operative grading of tumor consistency was performed by the neurosurgeon. Pathological report according to WHO 2007 was performed with additional semi-quantitative grading of fibrosis. This study is focused on correlation of operative grade and MRI findings.; Results: Meningioma with hard consistency shows significant correlation with several features including en plaque appearance (p = 0.0427), higher ADC value (p = 0.0046) and ratio (p = 0.0016), absent of prominent enhanced rim (p = 0.0306), absent of enostotic spur (p = 0.0040) and absent of vascular core (p = 0.0133) in univariate analysis but no significant correlation is found in multivariate analysis in all except ADC ratio. Higher ADC ratio increase relative risk of hard consistency of meningioma by a factor of 41.22 (ORs = 41.22; 95%CI = 1.19-1426.24, P = 0.04). Good to very good inter-rater agreements are found. No significant correlation between tumor consistency and WHO grading was shown (p = 0.606). However, near significant p-value (p = 0.055) is found with increase degree of fibrosis in pathology as increase degree of tumor consistency.; Conclusion: We found that en plaque appearance, higher ADC value and ADC ratio, absent of prominent capsular enhancement and absent of vascular core were suggestive of hard consistency in univariate analysis but not independent factors. Additionally, semi-quantitative pathological grading of fibrosis showed near significant correlation with tumor consistent.

T2  -  CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY

N2  -  Purpose of review To describe the path of technological developments that have led to the actual application of MRI-guided focused ultrasound in multiple neurological disorders and to update the more recent technical advances in the field. An insight into the latest clinical achievements in movement disorders will be provided, together with the neuroimaging advances for the screening, planning, and outcome evaluation. Recent findings Developments, such as phased array transducers and MRI guidance have allowed the use of focused ultrasound to successfully perform incisionless therapeutic ablation in deep brain structures. Although its indication through a thalamotomy has been approved for essential and parkinsonian tremor, it has also shown preliminary efficacy for other types of tremor, Parkinson's disease motor signs and neuropsychiatric disorders. In parallel, neuroradiological techniques have helped to improve treatment application and provided new evidence in terms of lesion topography, impact on distant structures and understanding of action mechanisms. Neuroimaging developments have helped to increase successful applications of focused ultrasound as a minimally invasive ablative approach and to understand the mechanisms by which ablation of a certain brain region improves neurological disorders. The field is expanding rapidly and in the coming years it will transform functional neurosurgery.

N2  -  BackgroundDiffuse lower-grade glioma (DLGG) in the central lobe is a challenge for safe resection procedures. To improve the extent of resection and reduce the risk of postoperative neurological deficits, we performed an awake craniotomy with cortical-subcortical direct electrical stimulation (DES) mapping for patients with DLGG located primarily within the central lobe. We investigated the outcomes of cortical-subcortical brain mapping using DES in an awake craniotomy for central lobe DLGG resection. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data of a cohort of consecutively treated patients from February 2017 to August 2021 with diffuse lower-grade gliomas located primarily within the central lobe. All patients underwent awake craniotomy with DES for cortical and subcortical mapping of eloquent brain areas, neuronavigation, and/or ultrasound to identify tumor location. Tumors were removed according to functional boundaries. Maximum safe tumor resection was the surgical objective for all patients. ResultsThirteen patients underwent 15 awake craniotomies with intraoperative mapping of eloquent cortices and subcortical fibers using DES. Maximum safe tumor resection was achieved according to functional boundaries in all patients. The pre-operative tumor volumes ranged from 4.3 cm(3) to 137.3 cm(3) (median 19.2 cm(3)). The mean extent of tumor resection was 94.6%, with eight cases (53.3%) achieving total resection, four (26.7%) subtotal and three (20.0%) partial. The mean tumor residue was 1.2 cm(3). All patients experienced early postoperative neurological deficits or worsening conditions. Three patients (20.0%) experienced late postoperative neurological deficits at the 3-month follow-up, including one moderate and two mild neurological deficits. None of the patients experienced late onset severe neurological impairments post-operatively. Ten patients with 12 tumor resections (80.0%) had resumed activities of daily living at the 3-month follow-up. Among 14 patients with pre-operative epilepsy, 12 (85.7%) were seizure-free after treatment with antiepileptic drugs 7 days after surgery up to the last follow-up. ConclusionsDLGG located primarily in the central lobe deemed inoperable can be safely resected using awake craniotomy with intraoperative DES without severe permanent neurological sequelae. Patients experienced an improved quality of life in terms of seizure control.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Microsurgery within eloquent cortex is a controversial approach because of the high risk of permanent neurological deficit. Few data exist showing the relationship between the mapping stimulation intensity required for eliciting a muscle motor evoked potential and the distance to the motor neurons; furthermore, the motor threshold at which no deficit occurs remains to be defined.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of low threshold motor evoked potential mapping for tumor resection close to the primary motor cortex.; METHODS: Fourteen patients undergoing tumor surgery were included. Motor threshold was defined as the stimulation intensity that elicited motor evoked potentials fromtarget muscles (amplitude > 30 mu V). Monopolar high-frequency motor mapping with train-of-5 stimuli (HF-TOF; pulse duration = 500 microseconds; interstimulus interval = 4.0 milliseconds; frequency = 250 Hz) was used to determine motor response-negative sites where incision and dissection could be performed. At sites negative to 3-mA HF-TOF stimulation, the tumor was resected.; RESULTS: HF-TOF mapping localized the motor neurons within the precentral gyrus by using variable, low-stimulation intensities. The lowest motor thresholds after final resection ranged from 3 to 6 mA, indicating close proximity of motor neurons. Post-operatively, 12 patients had no new motor deficit, 1 patient had a minor new temporary deficit (M4+, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 1), and another patient had a minor new permanent deficit ( M4+, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 2). Thirteen patients had complete or gross total resection.; CONCLUSION: These preliminary data demonstrate that a monopolar HF-TOF threshold > 3 mA was not associated with a significant new motor deficit.

N2  -  Purpose: The desire to quantitatively discriminate the extra-and intracellular tissue 1H2O MR signals has gone hand-in-hand with the continual, historic increase in MRI instrument magnetic field strength [ B0]. However, recent studies have indicated extremely valuable, novel metabolic information can be readily accessible at ultralow B0. The two signals can be distinguished, and the homeostatic activity of the cell membrane sodium/potassium pump (Na+, K+, ATPase) detected. The mechanism allowing 1H2O MRI to do this is the newly discovered active transmembrane water cycling (AWC) phenomenon, which we found using paramagnetic extracellular contrast agents at clinical B0 values. AWC is important because Na+, K+, ATPase can be considered biology's most vital enzyme, and its in vivo steady-state activity has not before been measurable, let alone amenable to mapping with high spatial resolution. Recent reports indicate AWC correlates with neuronal firing rate, with malignant tumor metastatic potential, and inversely with cellular reducing equivalent fraction. We wish to systematize the ways AWC can be precisely measured. Methods: We present a theoretical longitudinal relaxation analysis of considerable scope: it spans the low-and high-field situations. Results: We show the NMR shutter-speed organizing principle is pivotal in understanding how trans-membrane steady-state water exchange kinetics are manifest throughout the range. Our findings illuminate an aspect, apparent population inversion, which is crucial in understanding ultra-low field results. Conclusions: Without an appreciation of apparent population inversion, significant misinterpretations of future data are likely. These could have unfortunate diagnostic consequences.

N2  -  Proton phase shift imaging methods with keyholing were developed to rapidly monitor temperature during MR-guided radiofrequency (RF) interventional procedures on a .2-T open configuration scanner. Temperature calibration was performed on thermally controlled gel phantom and ex vivo bovine liver samples. Keyholing methods were implemented for rapid imaging and tested both in simulation experiments and in the gel phantom. Phase drifts from extraneous sources were monitored and compensated for using reference phantoms. Sequence parameters TE, TR, and flip angle (FA) were optimized for maximum temperature sensitivity and minimum noise., Reduction of phase noise from coupling of the magnetic field to external perturbations using navigator-echo-based correction schemes were also investigated. The extraneous phase drifts from the magnet could be minimized by keeping the electromagnet on continuously. Navigator echo corrected keyholed FLASH sequences (TE = 30 msec, TR = 60 msec, FA = 40 degrees, 64 x 128 matrix) were used to monitor the RF lesioning process in gel phantoms yielding images every 4 seconds with a temperature sensitivity of .015 ppm/degrees C. RF ablation in the bovine tissue was monitored using navigator-echo-corrected keyholed fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequences (TE = 30 msec, TR = 100 msec, FA = 40 degrees, 128 x 256 matrix) with a temporal resolution of 13 seconds and a temperature sensitivity of .007 ppm/degrees C. The results indicate that monitoring of an RF ablation procedure by mapping temperature with sufficient temporal resolution is possible using phase images of FLASH sequences on a .2-T open scanner.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively evaluate whether cardiac gating can improve the reproducibility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters in the head and neck, we performed IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using 4 b values (4b), 4 b values with cardiac gating (4b gating) and 17 b values (17b).
Methods: We performed IVIM DWI twice per person on nine healthy volunteers using 4b, 4b gating and 17b and five patients with head and neck masses using 4b gating and 17b. The ADC, perfusion fraction (f), diffusion coefficient (D) and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (D-star) were calculated in the brain, masticator muscle, parotid gland, submandibular gland, tonsil and masses. Intraclass coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman analysis (BAA) and coefficient of variation (CV) were used to assess short-term test-retest reproducibility. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test were used to investigate whether 4b, 4b gating or 17b had significant influences on the parameters.; Results: For normal tissues and masses, ICC was excellent for all maps except the D-star map. All parameters showed the lowest CV in the 4b gating. BAA also revealed the narrowest 95% limits of agreement using 4b gating for all parameters. In the subgroup analysis, almost all parameters in brain, muscle, parotid gland and submandibular gland showed the best reproducibility using 4b gating. In the muscle, parotid gland and submandibular gland, the values of ADC, f and D were not significantly different between among the three methods.; Conclusion: 4b gating was more reproducible with respect to measurements of IVIM parameters in comparison with 4b or 17b.

N2  -  Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion weighted image (DWI) in the prediction of neuroepithelial tumors grading, and to appraise the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of neuroepithelial tumors with histologic findings as a reference standard.
Materials and Methods: ADC values in 110 patients with pathologically proved neuroepithelial tumors, Including 77 astrocytic tumors, 16 oligodendroglial tumors, 11 oligoastrocytic tumors, and 6 ependymal tumors, were investigated retrospectively. The minimum ADC (MinADC) value of tumors was measured postoperatively on ADC maps, avoiding cystic, necrotic, or hemorrhagic components. The Ki-67 Labeling Index (Ki-67 LI) was determined by immunohistochemistry. The patients were classified into low (WHO II) and high (WHO III or IV) grade groups. Correlation analysis, Student t-test, Welch test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and analysis of variance were used for statistical evaluation.; Results: There was a negative correlation between MinADC value and Ki-67 LI (P < 0.001). The mean MinADC value (1.057 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) of low grade group was higher than that (0.773 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) of high grade group. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.809, and the cutoff MinADC value of 0.900 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for the differentiation between high and low grade neuroepithelial tumors provided the best combination of sensitivity (85.4%) and specificity (71.0%).; Conclusion: MinADC value may be a simple and effective optional tool for the prediction of neuroepithelial tumor grading.

N2  -  Introduction Surgery remains the mainstay for treatment of primary glioblastoma, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current standard of care during surgery involves the intraoperative use of image-guidance and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). There are multiple other surgical adjuncts available to the neuro-oncology surgeon. However, access to, and usage of these varies widely in UK practice, with limited evidence of their use. The aim of this trial is to investigate whether the addition of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) to the standard of care surgery (intraoperative neuronavigation and 5-ALA) impacts on deterioration free survival (DFS). Methods and analysis This is a two-stage, randomised control trial (RCT) consisting of an initial non-randomised cohort study based on the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term follow-up) stage-IIb format, followed by a statistically powered randomised trial comparing the addition of DTI and iUS to the standard of care surgery. A total of 357 patients will be recruited for the RCT. The primary outcome is DFS, defined as the time to either 10-point deterioration in health-related quality of life scores from baseline, without subsequent reversal, progressive disease or death. Ethics and dissemination The trial was registered in the Integrated Research Application System (Ref: 264482) and approved by a UK research and ethics committee (Ref: 20/LO/0840). Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Further dissemination to participants, patient groups and the wider medical community will use a range of approaches to maximise impact.

N2  -  Introduction: The pathomechanism of a single subcortical infarct (SSI) may be better determined by assessing the perfusion status between parent artery and ischemic lesion. We aimed to compare the classifications into branch atheromatous disease (BAD) versus non-BAD based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or computed tomography perfusion (CTP), and to test whether a CTP-based classification improves the predicting power for progression in SSI (PSSI) compared to that by DWI. Methods: We enrolled 109 consecutive patients with SSI examined by wholesupratentorial brain CTP and follow-up DWI. Time-to-drain (TTD) maps were calculated from 1-mm dynamic CTP data. BAD was assumed when either the ischemic lesion extended to the basal surface of the parent artery on axial DWI or the hypoperfused area (TTD >= 5 seconds) was < 5 mm apart from the cerebrospinal fluid perforators interface on both coronal and sagittal CTPs. We tested the relationship between DWI and CTP for determining BAD, and compared demographics, imaging, and the frequency of PSSI between the BAD and non-BAD based on CTP. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine predicting factors for PSSI. Results: On DWI, 66 of 109 patients (60.6%) were classified as BAD; on CTP, 32 patients were classified as BAD (29.4%), showing significant difference (P =.047). PSSI was significantly different between BAD versus non-BAD by CTP (40.6% versus 11.7%, P =.002), but not different by DWI (21.2% versus 18.6%, P =.930). BAD-type perfusion was the only independent predictor for PSSI (OR, 5.209; 95% CI, 1.745-15.555; P =.003). Conclusion: The classifications of SSI with and without BAD by CTP and DWI are significantly different. CTP may help to predict PSSI. (C) 2017 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background Mutant mouse models suggest that the chloride channel ClC-2 has functions in ion and water hornoeostasis, but this has not been confirmed in human beings. We aimed to define novel disorders characterised by distinct patterns of MR1 abnormalities in patients with leukoencephalopathies of unknown origin, and to identify the genes mutated in these disorders. We were specifically interested in leukoencephalopathies characterised by white matter oedema, suggesting a defect in ion and water homoeostasis.
Methods In this observational analytical study, we recruited patients with leukoencephalopathies characterised by MRI signal abnormalities in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, midbrain cerebral peduncles, and middle cerebellar peduncles from our databases of patients with leulcoencephalopathies of unknown origin. We used exome sequencing to identify the gene involved. We screened the candidate gene in additional patients by Sanger sequencing and mRNA analysis, and investigated the functional effects of the mutations. We assessed the localisation of ClC-2 with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in post-mortem human brains of individuals without neurological disorders.; Findings Seven patients met our indusion criteria, three with adult-onset disease and four with childhood-onset disease. We identified homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in CLCN2 in three adult and three paediatric patients. We found evidence that the CLCN2 mutations result in loss of function of ClC-2. The remaining paediatric patient had an X-linked family history and a mutation in GJB1, encoding connexin 32. Clinical features were variable and included cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, chorioretinopathy with visual field defects, optic neuropathy, cognitive defects, and headaches. MM showed restricted diffusion suggesting myelin vacuolation that was confined to the specified white matter structures in adult patients, and more diffusely involved the brain white matter in paediatric patients. We detected ClC-2 in all components of the panglial syncytium, enriched in astrocytic endfeet at the perivascular basal lamina, in the glia limitans, and in ependymal cells.; Interpretation Our observations substantiate the concept that ClC-2 is involved in brain ion and water homoeostasis. Autosomal-recessive CLCN2 mutations cause a leukoencephalopathy that belongs to an emerging group of disorders affecting brain ion and water homoeostasis and characterised by intramyelinic oedema.

N2  -  We built normative brain atlases that animate millisecond-scale intra-and inter-hemispheric white matter-level connectivity dynamics supporting object recognition and speech production. We quantified electrocorticographic modulations during three naming tasks using event-related high-gamma activity from 1,114 nonepileptogenic in-tracranial electrodes (i.e., non-lesional areas unaffected by epileptiform discharges). Using this electrocorticogra-phy data, we visualized functional connectivity modulations defined as significant naming-related high-gamma modulations occurring simultaneously at two sites connected by direct white matter streamlines on diffusion-weighted imaging tractography. Immediately after stimulus onset, intra-and inter-hemispheric functional con-nectivity enhancements were confined mainly across modality-specific perceptual regions. During response prepa-ration, left intra-hemispheric connectivity enhancements propagated in a posterior-to-anterior direction, involv-ing the left precentral and prefrontal areas. After overt response onset, inter-and intra-hemispheric connectivity enhancements mainly encompassed precentral, postcentral, and superior-temporal (STG) gyri. We found task-specific connectivity enhancements during response preparation as follows. Picture naming enhanced activity along the left arcuate fasciculus between the inferior-temporal and precentral/posterior inferior-frontal (pIFG) gyri. Nonspeech environmental sound naming augmented functional connectivity via the left inferior longitudi-nal and fronto-occipital fasciculi between the medial-occipital and STG/pIFG. Auditory descriptive naming task enhanced usage of the left frontal U-fibers, involving the middle-frontal gyrus. Taken together, the commonly ob-served network enhancements include inter-hemispheric connectivity optimizing perceptual processing exerted in each hemisphere, left intra-hemispheric connectivity supporting semantic and lexical processing, and inter-hemispheric connectivity for symmetric oral movements during overt speech. Our atlases improve the currently available models of object recognition and speech production by adding neural dynamics via direct intra-and inter-hemispheric white matter tracts.

N2  -  Introduction. Glioblastomas multiformes (GBM) remain incurable in most cases. Their invasion into normal brain makes current therapies ineffective. Post-mortem studies suggest about a 25% of GBMs invade less than 1 cm from the tumour bulk and 20% invade more than 3 cm. Aim of study. The study aims to use DTI to assess tumour extension and determine how previously reported patterns relate to the progression-free survival (PFS). Materials and methods. Twenty-five patients with GBM treated according to the EORTC/NCIC protocol were retrospectively analysed. Patients were imaged post-operatively at 1.5 T. The sequences were composed of standard anatomical and a standard DTI sequence. As described earlier p and q maps were constructed. For each of the p and q maps, regions of interest were drawn around the visible abnormality. Patients were assigned a diffuse, localised or minimally invasive pattern. Progression was defined according to the RANO criteria(4) and PFS determined in days. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival for the three groups were plotted as were the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 24 months. Results. The median PFS for the diffuse group was 278 days, for the localised group 605 days and 820 days for the minimally invasive group. Three-fourth of the minimally invasive group were progression-free at 24 months (LOG RANK 9.25; p = 0.010). Conclusion. It is possible to identify three invasive phenotypes in GBMs using Diffusion tensor imaging, and these three phenotypes have different progression free survival. A minimal phenotype (20% of patients) predicts a greater delay to progression.

N2  -  Fiber tracking of the white matter using diffusion tensor imaging is a new imaging technique to visualize the integrity of the white matter. This study investigated the capability of this technique to localize the lacunar infarctions, particularly with respect to the body parts affected, by correlating the location of the lesion with the clinical symptoms topographically. Twenty-seven patients with capsular and pericapsular small acute infarctions underwent diffusion tensor imaging and subsequent fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract (CST). According to the lesion topography with regard to the CST, the infarctions were classified into four types: (1) the anterior type (n = 9) involving the anterior part of the CST, (2) the central type (n = 9) involving the middle or whole part of the CST, (3) the posterior type (it = 5) involving the posterior part of the CST and (4) the intact type (n = 4) not involving the CST. Motor weakness of the face, upper extremities and lower extremities was found at 100%, 67% and 44%, respectively in the anterior type, at 89%, 100% and 89%, respectively in the central type and at 20%, 80% and 100%, respectively in the posterior type. The intact type was not associated with motor weakness. In conclusion, the fiber tracking technique of the CST enables the specific localization of capsular and pericapsular infarctions with regard to the body parts affected. These results also confirm the topographical accuracy of the fiber tracking of the CST. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-tensor fractional anisotropy (FA) is an index of neural-fiber damage in patients following stroke. To better characterize FA, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is frequently used, which involves spatial transformation into the standard brain space. Despite its utility, this technique is susceptible to space-occupying hematoma in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. To correct this, "lesion making" has been proposed. Here, FA values from TBSS without lesion masking and TBSS with lesion masking were compared, and the clinical utility was evaluated. Methods: Forty patients from our previously published work were entered into the study. Diffusion-tensor imagings were acquired 14-21 days after onset and FA maps were generated. Lesion masks were produced in reference with nondiffusion (b = 0) brain images. Two types (with or without lesion masking) of TBSS were then performed. For both types, using individual data we extracted mean FA values within for the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). FA ratio (rFA) between the lesioned hemisphere and the unaffected hemisphere was then calculated. The two sets of the data were then compared by assessing residuals of mean root sum square error (RMSE). Results: Although rFA obtained from TBSS with lesion masking tended to be slightly smaller, the estimated RMSE was .025 for both the CST and the SLF. Conclusions: The estimated FA differences between the two sets of TBSS were very small. Considering the time for manual labor for producing lesion masks, regular TBSS without lesion masking may be sufficient in terms of clinical utility.

N2  -  High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of neural structures has been used since 1997 as an alternative to lesions in functional neurosurgery of movement disorders and more recently, it has been applied to the treatment of epilepsies, obsessive-compulsive disorders, cluster headaches, and has other applications in experimental models, particularly for obesity. Although their clinical efficacy is not questioned, and that the effects most of the time parallel those of ablative techniques, leading to the concept of functional inhibition, the intimate mechanisms by which HFS induces excitation within fiber bundles and seems to inhibit cellular nuclei is still strongly debated. Principally due to the observation of long-term clinical effects over a period up to 15 years, it is clear that the mechanism is not due to a progressive lesion, as at every moment the interruption of stimulation reverses totally the effects. There is no current proof that long-term HFS is able to reset neural networks, or to induce profound modifications of the functional organization or of the synaptic connectivity. To understand what is responsible for the immediate, reversible and adaptable effects of HFS, several mechanisms must be considered, which might be involved simultaneously or in sequence : i) Jamming of neural transmission through stimulated nuclei is one possibility, based on the principle that the regular imposed activity might drive the neurons to fire in a regular pattern, making it impossible to transmit more subtle messages, either normal or abnormal. Although it is difficult to prove this type of mechanism, it might account for the reports of increased activity following HFS in various structures. ii) Direct inhibition of spike initiation at the level of the membrane could be due to activation of inhibitory terminals, particularly gaba-ergic, or by a blockade of the voltage gated ion channels. iii) Recent data show that HFS decreases the production and release of low molecular weight proteic neurotransmitters, which could account for the functional inhibition while the efferent axon is still excited by the electrical stimulus. iv) Retrograde activation of upstream neuronal structures, as reported in the external pallidum during stimulation of STN, might be responsible of additional jamming-like effects due to collisions with descending spikes. Due to the geometry of the chronic electrodes used in human patients, and to their size as compared to the size of the neural elements, the tentative model of the mechanisms of HFS must take into account possible simultaneous effects of stimulation on the presynaptic, synaptic, axonal, dendritic and post synaptic events, as well as on the fibers "de passage" involved in the vicinity of the stimulating electrodes. To this respect, modeling of the spatial distribution of voltages and currents appears to be of extreme importance. A global model of the mechanism of HFS is proposed. At the level of the somata and cell bodies, spike initiation is profoundly altered leading to a total suppression of spikes, as recorded in pallidal and subthalamic neurons of parkinsonian patients, possibly alterning with intensity driven spike activity such as reported in STN on brain slices, using intracellular recordings. It seems from these studies that the presynaptic effects are not the determining events. The axonal efferents of the stimulated neurons, whatever happens at the level of the cell body, are more than probably excited.
Therefore, the spikes which are initiated will travel along the axons down to the next synapse where tey should initiate the release of neurotransmitter However recent data tend to prove that the synapse might not be able to function due to the shortage of neurotransmitter induced by the arrest of protein synthesis, transfer and release induced by HFS as shown by the use of protein molecular approaches. The fibers passing within the area and influenced by stimulation, but coming from neurons, whose cell bodies are situated at distance and not influenced by stimulation, are clearly stimulated and the spikes therefore initiated would trigger neurotransmitter release at their far target destination. This would account for the induction of clinical side effects, which are typically of excitatory type.

N2  -  Classic models of language organization posited that separate motor and sensory language foci existed in the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and superior temporal.gyrus (Wernicke's area), respectively, and that connections between these sites (arcuate fasciculus) allowed for auditory-motor interaction. These theories have predominated for more than a century, but advances in neuroimaging and stimulation mapping have provided a more detailed description of the functional neuroanatomy of language. New insights have shaped modern network-based models of speech processing composed of parallel and interconnected streams involving both cortical and subcortical areas. Recent models emphasize processing in "dorsal" and "ventral" pathways, mediating phonological and semantic processing, respectively. Phonological processing occurs along a dorsal pathway, from the posterosuperior temporal to the inferior frontal cortices. On the other hand, semantic information is carried in a ventral pathway that runs from the temporal pole to the basal occipitotemporal cortex, with anterior connections. Functional MRI has poor positive predictive value in determining critical language sites and should only be used as an adjunct for preoperative planning. Cortical and subcortical mapping should be used to define functional resection boundaries in eloquent areas and remains the clinical gold standard. In tracing the historical advancements in our understanding of speech processing, the authors hope to not only provide practicing neurosurgeons with additional information that will aid in surgical planning and prevent postoperative morbidity, but also underscore the fact that neurosurgeons are in a unique position to further advance our understanding of the anatomy and functional organization of language.

N2  -  Acute brain plasticity during resection of central lesions has been recently described. In the cases reported, perilesional latent networks, useful to preserve the neurological functions, were detected in asymptomatic patients. In this paper, we presented a case of acute functional reactivation (AFR) of the language network in a symptomatic patient. Tumor resection allowed to acutely restore the neurological deficit. Intraoperative direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and functional neuroimaging showed new epicentres of activation of the language network after tumor excision. DCS in awake surgery is mandatory to reveal AFR needful to improve the extent of resection preserving the quality of life.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: It has been difficult to obtain anatomic and functional information about the visual pathway during neurosurgical operations. The aim of this study was to combine the information of the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and the anatomic navigation of the optic radiation by diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography for functional monitoring of the visual pathway.
METHODS: The subjects were two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the visual pathway. Diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography of the optic radiation was performed by selecting appropriate regions of interest and by fractional anisotropy. During surgery, cortical VEPs were recorded continuously under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. In Patient 2, the results of optic radiation tractography were imported to a neuronavigation system to better understand the spatial relationships between the lesions and the visual pathway (functional neuronavigation).; RESULTS: In Patient 1, the lesion did not seem to be attached to the optic radiation, and VEP profiles remained stable during resection. In Patient 2, who had a lesion adjacent to the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, VEPs suddenly diminished when resection reached the optic radiation as illustrated on the neuronavigation system. AS a result, complete left hemianopia developed after surgery in Patient 2.; CONCLUSION: We confirmed functional correlations of the results of diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography by monitoring intraoperative VEPs. The combination of continuous VEP and optic-radiation tractography is reliable to monitor the visual function and is helpful in performing neurosurgical planning near the visual pathway.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this work is to define a methodological strategy for the minimally invasive tubular retractor (MITR) parafascicular transulcal approach (PTA) for the management of brain tumors sited in eloquent areas. Methods: An observational prospective study was designed to evaluate the benefits of PTA associated with MITRs, tractography and intraoperative cortical stimulation. They study was conducted from June 2018 to June 2021. Information regarding white matter tracts was processed, preventing a potential damage during the approach and/or resection. All patients older than 18 years who had a single brain tumor lesion were included in the study. Patients with a preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score greater than 70% and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score > 14 points were included. Results: 72 patients were included in the study, the mean age was 49.6, the most affected gender was male, 12.5% presented aphasia, 11.1% presented paraphasia, 41.6% had motor deficit, 9.7% had an affection in the optic pathway, the most frequently affected region was the frontal lobe (26.3%), the most frequent lesions were high-grade gliomas (34.7%) and the measurement of the incisions was on average 5.58 cm. Of the patients, 94.4% underwent a total macroscopic resection and 90.2% did not present new postoperative neurological deficits. In all cases, a PTA was used. Conclusion: Tubular minimally invasive approaches (MIAs) allow one to perform maximal safe resection of brain tumors in eloquent areas, through small surgical corridors. Future comparative studies between traditional and minimally invasive techniques are required to further investigate the potential of these surgical nuances.

N2  -  A new model based on an extension of the Krogh's cylindrical model was developed to calculate tumor oxygen tension (pO(2)) from the H-1 dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) measurements. The model enables one to calculate the tumor pO(2) using the vascular volume fraction (f(b)) obtained by the DCE-MRI. The proposed model has three parameters. For small values of f(b) one assumes that there exists a linear relationship between and f(b). The constant of proportionality in this case is given by C-1 - the oxygen tension per vascular volume fraction. For larger values of f(b) a modified version of Krogh model using two parameters is developed and here C-2 - is the integrated blood oxygen tension, and C-3 - given by the combination of the oxygen diffusion coefficient, solubility of oxygen in the tissue, capillary radius, and tissue metabolic consumption rate. The parameters of the model can be determined by performing simultaneous in-vivo F-19 MRI oxygen tension measurement and dynamic Gd-DTPA enhanced MRI on the same tumor. Dynamic MRI data can be used with a compartmental model to calculate tumor vascular volume fraction on a pixel by pixel basis. Then tumor oxygen tension map can be calculated from the vascular volume fraction by the extended Krogh model as described above. In the present work, the model parameters were determined using three rats bearing Walker-256 tumors and performing simultaneous F-19 and DCE MRI on the same tumor. The parameters obtained by fitting the model equation to the experimental data were: C-1 = 983.2 +/- 133.2torr, C-2 = 58.20 +/- 2.4 torr, and C-3 = 1.7 +/- 0.1 torr. The performance of the extended Krogh model was then tested on two additional rats by performing both F-19 and DCE-MRI studies and calculating the pO(2) (H-1) using the model and comparing it with the pO(2) (F-19) obtained from the F-19 MRI. It was found that the measurements obtained by both techniques had a high degree of correlation [pO(2) (H-1) = (1.01 +/- 0.07) pO(2) (F-19) + (0.91 +/- 0.05) and r=0.96], indicating the applicability of the proposed model in determining pO(2) from the DCE-MRI.

N2  -  In cancer research, tumor spheroids are a well established system to study tumor metabolism resembling the situation in vivo more closely cell monolayers. Spherical aggregates of malignant melanoma cells (MV3) and their invasion into rat brain aggregates have been investigated by quantitative NMR microscopy, Relaxation times (T-1, T-2) and diffusion parameter images were acquired with an in-plane resolution of 14 x 14 mu m(2) The authors were able to demonstrate that the morphology of the spheroids can be visualized on these NMR maps, The contrast was mainly manifested in relaxation maps, where average relaxation times T-1 = 1.94 +/- 0.17 s and T-2 = 42.8 +/- 6.3 ms were obtained for proliferating cells, and T-1 = 2.49 +/- 0.31 s and T-2 = 104.3 +/- 29.4 ms for the necrobiotic center, The mean diffusion coefficients were 0.59 +/- 0.12 mu m(2)/ms and 0.85 +/- 0.14 mu m(2)/ms, respectively, The authors could follow the dynamic process of tumor cell invasion in the investigated co-culture system, Knowledge about tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion is essential for the understanding of cancer and its therapy, Quantitative NMR microscopy can study this dynamic process noninvasively and therefore may help to assess the influence of therapy on the micromilieu of these spheroids.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have evaluated 12 patients with cerebral alveolar echinococcosis (AE). All patients underwent surgery for cerebral AE. We aimed to demonstrate the relationship between the demographic properties of patients and surgical outcomes as well as surgical suggestions about surgical approaches.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were analyzed according to demographic properties, hepaticpulmonary AE lesion existence, symptoms, neurological and radiological examination, histopathological findings, and outcome after treatment.; RESULTS: Preoperative diagnosis based on the history of the patient, neurological examination, serological tests, and radiology. When enhanced radiological imaging like MR-Tractography and intraoperative neuromonitoring is combined with precision surgical methods cerebral AE is treatable. Ten of twelve cerebral AE patients had favorable outcomes after surgery.; CONCLUSIONS: AE of the brain is a rare but life-threatening parasitic disease. Wherever the primary focus is, surgery for cerebral involvement of AE is challenging but safe with appropriate surgical techniques and the help of radiological examination.

N2  -  ObjectiveTo explore the relationship between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cerebral deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), and measures of white matter integrity in patients with late-onset depression, with respect to vascular risk factors.
MethodWe examined 22 patients with late-onset depression and 22 matched controls. Quantification of plasma BDNF and VEGF levels were performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Measures of white matter integrity comprised apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA), obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Effects of DWMLs, FA, ADC, and vascular risk factors on BDNF and VEGF were assessed using multiple linear regression.; ResultsThe BDNF and VEGF levels did not differ significantly between groups. With pooled data for patients and controls, the BDNF level was positively associated with both number (t=2.14, P=0.039) and volume (t=2.04, P=0.048) of prefrontal DWMLs and negatively associated with FA in prefrontal normal-appearing white matter (t=-2.40, P=0.02), adjusted for age and gender. Smoking and hypercholesterolemia was positively associated with the BDNF (t=2.36, P=0.023) and VEGF levels (t=2.28, P=0.028), respectively.; ConclusionOur results suggest a role for BDNF in the complex pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying DWMLs in both normal aging and late-onset depression.

N2  -  The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of preoperative fMRI, tractography, and intraoperative continuous task during awake surgery in preserving postoperative motor function. in patients undergoing resection of metastatic brain tumors in or near the primary motor area. Three patients with metastatic brain tumors in the primary motor area elected to undergo surgical treatment. Preoperative fMRI and tractography were performed, and various primary motor areas (e.g., hand, arm, face and leg) were identified and confirmed by cortical mapping or by the outcome of awake surgery. Cortical mapping and continuous appropriate task were performed during awake surgery. Preoperative fMRI and tractography correctly identified the primary motor area. In contrast, cortical mapping identified the gyrus of the primary motor area but was unable to identify specific primary motor areas, such as those for the hand or arm, which were compressed by the tumor. Tumor resection was terminated when any deterioration in continuous task performance was observed during awake surgery. Paresis was transient and resolved within one week in all cases. The combination of preoperative fMRI, tractography and continuous task during awake surgery helped to maintain motor function following surgical management of metastatic brain tumors of the primary motor cortex.

N2  -  We present two patients with metastatic brain tumors who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT that yielded estimates of blood volume, blood flow, and microvascular permeability. For one patient, these CT-based quantifications were compared with contrast-enhanced MR-based assessments of fractional blood volume and permeability. Regional blood volume heterogeneity patterns were consistent between both CT- and MR imaging-based mapping. Permeability variations across the tumor, however, were less consistent, perhaps because of differences between ionic and non-ionic contrast agents. The advantages of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT in comparison with dynamic, contrast-enhanced MR imaging for microvascular quantifications are its availability and lower costs, applicability in the presence of MR imaging contraindications, and potentially more accurate analyses. The disadvantages are its limited anatomic coverage, radiation exposure, and the need for injection of a contrast agent.

N2  -  Purpose of review
This review will report on the new aspects of management of 'malignant' middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions.; Recent findings; Large MCA infarctions have been associated with high death rates for years. The most reliable predictors of a 'malignant' course are hypodensity in more than 50% of the MCA territory on computed tomography as well as stroke volume greater than 145 ml on diffusion-weighted imaging. Real-time neuromonitoring may be helpful in the detection of development of cerebral edema. The attempt of recanalization of the affected artery utilizing a combination of intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is crucial. Monitoring of intracranial pressure has not been proven helpful. Decompressive surgery within 48 h after symptom onset in patients less than 60 years old reduces mortality and severe disability. The quality of life perceived by the survivors is variable and deserves further study. The neuroprotective effect of hypothermia requires additional investigation.; Summary; The era of decompressive hemicraniectomy has changed the prospects of patients with large infarctions in the MCA or internal carotid artery territory who are at risk of development of 'malignant' cerebral edema. Timing of surgery and appropriate patient selection based on age and other criteria need to be refined.

N2  -  Object. Preservation of the visual field in glioma surgery, especially avoidance of hemianopia, is crucial for patients' quality of life, particularly for driving. Recent studies used tractography or cortical occipital stimulation to try to avoid visual deficit. However, optic radiations have not been directly mapped intraoperatively. The authors present, for the first time to their knowledge, a consecutive series of awake surgeries for cerebral glioma with intrasurgical identification and preservation of visual pathways using subcortical electrical mapping.
Methods. Fourteen patients underwent awake resection of a glioma (1 WHO Grade I, 11 WHO Grade II, 2 WHO Grade III) involving the optic radiations. The patients had no presurgical visual field deficit. Intraoperatively, a picture-naming task was used, with presentation of 2 objects situated diagonally on a screen divided into 4 quadrants. An image was presented in the quadrant to be saved and another image was presented in the opposite quadrant. Direct subcortical electrostimulation was repeatedly performed without the patient's knowledge, until optic radiations were identified (transient visual disturbances). All patients underwent an objective visual field assessment 3 months after surgery.; Results. All patients experienced visual symptoms during stimulation. These disturbances led the authors to stop the tumor resection at that level. Postoperatively, only 1 patient had a permanent hemianopia, despite an expected quadrantanopia in 12 cases. The mean extent of resection was 93.6% (range 85%-100%).; Conclusions. Online identification of optic radiations by direct subcortical electrostimulation is a reliable and effective method to avoid permanent hemianopia in surgery for gliomas involving visual pathways.

N2  -  Object: Damage to the deep venous system, occipital lobe, and/or corpus callosum is well known to cause complications associated with the occipital transtentorial approach (OTA), but ischemic complications are not well documented. The authors investigated the high incidences of ischemic complications associated with removal of pineal/tectal/thalamic tumors through the OTA.
Methods: Clinical records of 29 patients who underwent 31 surgeries using the OTA from December 2001 to May 2011 were retrospectively studied. Tumor locations were the pinealtectalthalamic region for 19, cerebellum for 7, and medial temporal lobe for 3.; Results: Postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained within 72 h after surgery detected infarction in the tectalsplenialthalamic region, presumably representing the medial posterior choroidal artery (MPChA) territory, in 10 patients. All these patients had tumor in the pinealtectalthalamic region. Deteriorated or newly developed eye symptoms including vertical gaze palsy tended to persist in these patients compared to those without ischemic complications.; Conclusions: A relatively high incidence of MPChA territory infarction was associated with removal of tumors in the pinealtectalthalamic region through the OTA. Eye symptoms often occurred post-surgery and tended to persist in these patients. Neurosurgeons must be aware of the possibility of MPChA territory infarction to further increase the safety of the OTA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  A 43-year-old man presented with a grade II astrocytoma in the left postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule. Preoperative functional MR imaging and diffusion tensor imaging mapped distal upper-extremity primary motor cortex and white matter, respectively, adjacent to the tumor, within a congenitally truncated precentral gyrus. Because of the congenital anomaly, this region of primary motor cortex was inaccessible to direct visualization or intraoperative electrocortical stimulation. The integration of preoperative and intraoperative mapping data facilitated resection of the tumor while avoiding a postoperative motor deficit.

N2  -  Left hemispatial neglect (neglect) is an impaired state of spatial attention. We aimed to reconstruct structural connectivity in the spatial attention network and to identify disconnection patterns underlying neglect. We enrolled 59 right-handed patients who had their first-ever infarction in the right hemisphere and classified them into neglect group (34 patients with neglect) and control group (25 patients without neglect). The neglect group was further subcategorized into 6 subgroups based on infarcted vascular territories. Diffusion tensor imaging data were obtained from all patients. Fractional anisotropy maps were compared between neglect group/subgroups and the control group by using non-parametric voxel-based analysis, generating a lesion path mask. Probabilistic tractography analysis using the lesion path mask reconstructed the following structural connectivity in the spatial attention network, which is specifically damaged in neglect patients: (1) superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) I connecting the superior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus with the superior frontal gyrus/frontal eye field (SFG/FEF) (dorsal attention network); (2) SLF III/the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the extreme capsule/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) connecting the right inferior parietal lobule/temporoparietal junction/superior temporal gyrus (IPL/TPJ/STG) with the middle frontal gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus (ventral attention network); (3) the thalamic radiations to the spatial attention-related cortices; and (4) SLF II and IFOF interconnecting dorsal and ventral attention networks. Individual analysis indicated that isolated damage in SLF I, SLF II, SLF III/AF or the thalamic radiations to IPL/TPJ/STG due to posterior cerebral artery infarction, or simultaneous damage in four thalamic radiations due to anterior choroidal artery infarction, underlies different phenotypes of neglect.

N2  -  Two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to interact, with the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influencing the timing of the interactions. We introduce an in vivo approach for measuring functional delays across the whole brain in humans (of either sex) using magneto/electroence-phalography (MEG/EEG) and integrating them with the structural bundles. The resulting topochronic map of the functional delays/velocities shows that larger bundles have faster velocities. We estimated the topochronic map in multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and controls, demonstrating greater delays in patients across the network and that structurally lesioned tracts were slowed down more than unaffected ones. We provide a novel framework for estimating functional transmission delays in vivo at the single-subject and single-tract level.

N2  -  Introduction: In the field of Glioma surgery, there has been an increasing interest in the use of assistive technologies to overcome the difficulty of preserving brain function while improving surgical radicality. In most reports, tumor localization has seldom been considered a variable and the role of intraoperative adjuncts is yet to be determined for gliomas of the insula.
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of fluorescence-guided resection with 5-ALA, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM), neuronavigation, and tractography in the Extent of Resection (EOR), functionality scores, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a retrospective cohort of insular gliomas.; Methods: We reviewed all cases of insular tumors operated on at the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Tubingen Germany, between May 2008 and November 2013. EOR was determined by volumetric analysis. Mann Whitney, Chi-square and Kaplan Meier functions were used for assessment of each technology's effect on primary and secondary outcomes.; Results: 28 cases (18 men (64%) and 10 women (36%); median age at diagnosis: 52.5 years, range 12 - 59) were considered eligible for analysis. High grade and low grade gliomas accounted for 20 (71%) and 8 (29%) cases, respectively. The most used technologies were IOM (64%) and Neuronavigation (68%). 5-ALA was the only technique associated with EOR >= 90% (p = 0.05). Tractography determined improvement in the Karnofsky Performance Scale (50% vs. 5% cases improved, p = 0.02). There was a positive association between the use of neuronavigation and overall survival (23 vs. 27.4 months, p = 0.03), but the use of 5-ALA was associated with shorter OS (34.8 vs. 21.1 months, p = 0.01) and PFS (24.4 vs. 11.8, p = 0.01).; Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that for insular gliomas 5-ALA plays a role in achieving higher EOR, although this technology was associated with poor OS and PFS; also tractography and neuronavigation can be of great importance in the treatment of insular gliomas as they determined better functionality and OS in this study, respectively. Prospective studies with a more prominent sample and proper multivariate analysis will help determine the real benefit of these adjuncts in the setting of insular gliomas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Purpose Diaschisis of cerebrocerebellar loops contributes to cognitive and motor deficits in pediatric cerebellar brain tumor survivors. We used a cerebellar white matter atlas and hypothesized that lesion symptom mapping may reveal the critical lesions of cerebellar tracts. Methods We examined 31 long-term survivors of pediatric posterior fossa tumors (13 pilocytic astrocytoma, 18 medulloblastoma). Patients underwent neuronal imaging, examination for ataxia, fine motor and cognitive function, planning abilities, and executive function. Individual consolidated cerebellar lesions were drawn manually onto patients' individual MRI and normalized into Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space for further analysis with voxel-based lesion symptom mapping. Results Lesion symptom mapping linked deficits of motor function to the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), deep cerebellar nuclei (interposed nucleus (IN), fastigial nucleus (FN), ventromedial dentate nucleus (DN)), and inferior vermis (VIIIa, VIIIb, IX, X). Statistical maps of deficits of intelligence and executive function mapped with minor variations to the same cerebellar structures. Conclusion We identified lesions to the SCP next to deep cerebellar nuclei as critical for limiting both motor and cognitive function in pediatric cerebellar tumor survivors. Future strategies safeguarding motor and cognitive function will have to identify patients preoperatively at risk for damage to these critical structures and adapt multimodal therapeutic options accordingly.

N2  -  Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and the trace of diffusion tensor [Trace (D)], a marker of water molecule diffusivity, provide information on structural integrity of nervous tissues. To investigate structural lesions within the brain's neuronal architecture in early stages of Parkinson's disease, 12 patients with disease duration of 3.5 +/- 1.5 years were studied with DWI. Data were compared with 12 age-matched healthy control subjects. To objectively localize focal changes of structural neuronal integrity without having to make an a priori hypothesis as to its location statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was applied to our DWI study. SPM localized significant increases of diffusivity in the region of both olfactory tracts in patients (P < 0.001). Trace (D) cut-off values for the voxel cluster of the olfactory tracts have been calculated from the subjects entered into SPM and applied to a total of 17 different individuals (9 patients with Parkinson's disease, disease duration 3.1 +/- 1.3 years and 8 age-matched healthy subjects). Out of 17 subjects, 16 subjects, i.e. 94%, were correctly discriminated with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%. All patients with Parkinson's disease were correctly classified and only one normal subject was classified as having the disease, underlining the high potential of this method to separate patients with the illness from healthy subjects. Increased diffusivity in the olfactory tract is in line with the well-established clinical finding of hyposmia in Parkinson's disease. Whether DWI can be used as a marker to identify individuals at risk to develop this disease remains to be shown.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The frontal aslant tract (FAT) is a white matter fiber pathway connecting the superior frontal gyrus to the Broca area. This tract in the dominant hemisphere has been shown to play a role in speech initiation and production, and direct subcortical stimulation can induce stuttering and speech arrest in a patient. However, controversy remains as to whether disruption of this pathway will lead to a permanent language deficit and if it is even necessary to map this tract during tumor resections of the dominant frontal lobe.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a case of a patient with a lower-grade diffuse glioma invading the dominant FAT that was removed with an asleep craniotomy. In the immediate postoperative state, the patient had a transcortical motor dysphasia and was unable to initiate speech. These immediate language deficits quickly recovered, and the patient was neurologically intact at the time of discharge a few days after surgery.; CONCLUSIONS: Given the high likelihood for a complete neurologic recovery including transient aphasia, we propose that awake mapping for the purpose of identifying the dominant FAT is unnecessary during tumor resection and that disruption of this tract is not associated with any long-term language deficits.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to describe the clinicodemographic profiles, management, and outcomes of brain stem lesions in 53 pediatric patients with brain stem lesions. Most of the patients were male, 6 to 10 years of age (8.66 +/- 4.69). Out of 53 patients, there were 77.36% brain stem gliomas, 11.32% tuberculomas, 5.66% abscesses, 3.77% cavernomas, and 1.89% schwannomas. With advancement in neuroimaging (e.g., tractography), intraoperative technology (e.g., ultrasound, neurophysiological monitoring, and magnetic resonance imaging), and safe and precise incision for particular lesions, majority of brain stem lesions had improved outcomes (67.92%) with significant reduction in morbidity and mortality (11.32%).

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging has been widely used in the research on post-stroke verbal fluency but acquiring diffusion data is not always clinically feasible. Achieving comparable reliability for detecting brain variables associated with verbal fluency impairments, based on more readily available anatomical, non-diffusion images (T1, T2 and FLAIR), enables clinical practitioners to have complementary neurophysiological information at hand to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of language impairment. Meanwhile, although the predominant focus in the stroke recovery literature has been on cortical contributions to verbal fluency, it remains unclear how subcortical regions and white matter disconnection are related to verbal fluency. Our study thus utilized anatomical scans of ischaemic stroke survivors (n = 121) to identify longitudinal relationships between subcortical volume, white matter tract disconnection, and verbal fluency performance at 3-and 12-months post stroke. Subcortical grey matter volume was derived from FreeSurfer. We used an indirect probabilistic approach to quantify white matter disconnection in terms of disconnection severity, the proportion of lesioned voxel volume to the total volume of a tract, and disconnection probability, the probability of the overlap between the stroke lesion and a tract. These disconnection variables of each subject were identified based on the disconnectome map of the BCBToolkit. Using a linear mixed multiple regression method with 5-fold cross-validations, we correlated the semantic and phonemic fluency scores with longitudinal measurements of subcortical grey matter volume and 22 bilateral white matter tracts, while controlling for demographic variables (age, sex, handedness and education), total brain volume, lesion volume, and cortical thickness. The results showed that the right subcortical grey matter volume was positively correlated with phonemic fluency averaged over 3 months and 12 months. The finding generalized well on the test data. The disconnection probability of left superior longitudinal fasciculus II and left posterior arcuate fasciculus was negatively associated with semantic fluency only on the training data, but the result aligned with our previous study using diffusion scans in the same clinical population. In sum, our results presented evidence that routinely acquired anatomical scans can serve as a reliable source for deriving neural variables of post-stroke verbal fluency performance. The use of this method might provide an ecologically valid and more readily implementable analysis tool.

N2  -  The production and comprehension of human language is thought to involve a network of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical loci interconnected by two dominant white matter pathways. These two white matter bundles, often referred to as the dorsal and ventral processing tracts, are hypothesized to have markedly different language functions. The dorsal tract is thought to process phonological processing, while the ventral tract is considered to abet semantics. This proposed functional differentiation of tracts is similar to the ventral and dorsal dichotomy proposed for the visual and auditory systems. The present study evaluated this characterization of the language system in the context of various components involved in its function. Twenty-four chronic stroke patients completed a battery of 10 language tests designed to measure performance on the comprehension and production of phonology, morphology, semantics, and syntax. The patients also completed diffusion MRI scanning. Lesions were confined to the left hemisphere, but the size and location of the insult varied so that patients had damage to a single tract, both tracts, or neither tract. Individual FA maps were generated, and focal areas of hypointensity served as markers of white matter damage. Whole-brain voxel-by-voxel correlations revealed that only phonological and semantic tasks fit into the dual-stream model, while syntax and morphology involved both pathways. ROI analyses of the arcuate fascicle and extreme capsule supported this finding. These data suggest that natural language function is more likely to reflect a synergistic system rather than a segregated dual-stream system.

N2  -  The ability to perceive and produce music is a quintessential element of human life, present in all known cultures. Modern functional neuroimaging has revealed that music listening activates a large-scale bilateral network of cortical and subcortical regions in the healthy brain. Even the most accurate structural studies do not reveal which brain areas are critical and causally linked to music processing. Such questions may be answered by analysing the effects of focal brain lesions in patients' ability to perceive music. In this sense, acquired amusia after stroke provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neural architectures crucial for normal music processing. Based on the first large-scale longitudinal studies on stroke-induced amusia using modern multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (Mn) techniques, such as advanced lesion-symptom mapping, grey and white matter morphometry, tractography and functional connectivity, we discuss neural structures critical for music processing, consider music processing in light of the dual-stream model in the right hemisphere, and propose a neural model for acquired amusia.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Super-resolution track density imaging generates anatomic images with submillimeter voxel resolution by using high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging and fiber-tractography. TDI within the diseased human brain has not been previously described. The purpose of this study was to correlate TDI with histopathologic features of GBM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 tumor specimens (24 contrast-enhancing, 12 NE, and 7 centrally necrotic regions) were collected from 18 patients with treatment-naive GBM by use of MR imaging-guided neurosurgical techniques. Immunohistochemical stains were used to evaluate the following histopathologic features: hypoxia, architectural disruption, microvascular hyperplasia, and cellular proliferation. We reconstructed track density maps at a 0.25-mm isotropic spatial resolution by using probabilistic streamline tractography combined with constrained spheric deconvolution (model order, 8; 0.1-mm step size; 1 million seed points). Track density values were obtained from each tissue site. A P value of .05 was considered significant and was adjusted for multiple comparisons by use of the false discovery rate method.; RESULTS: Track density was not significantly different between contrast-enhancing and NE regions but was more likely to be elevated within regions demonstrating aggressive histopathologic features (P < .05). Significant correlation between relative track density and hypoxia (odds ratio, 3.52; P = .01), architectural disruption (odds ratio, 3.49; P = .03), and cellular proliferation (odds ratio, 1.70; P = .05) was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of contrast enhancement.; CONCLUSIONS: Numeric values of track density correlate with GBM biologic features and may be clinically useful for identification of regions of tumor infiltration within both enhancing and NE components of GBM.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In adult patients, an increasing group of neurosurgeons specialize entirely in the treatment of highly eloquent tumors, particularly gliomas. In contrast, extensive perioperative neurophysiological workup for pediatric cases has been limited essentially to epilepsy surgery.
METHODS The authors discuss radio- oncological and general oncological considerations based on the current literature and their personal experience.; RESULTS While several functional mapping modalities facilitate preoperative identification of cortically and subcortically located eloquent areas, not all are suited for children. Direct cortical intraoperative stimulation is impractical in many young patients due to the reduced excitability of the immature cortex. Behavioral requirements also limit the utility of functional MRI and magnetoencephalography in children. In contrast, MRI- derived tractography and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation are available across ages. Herein, the authors review the oncological rationale of functionguided resection in pediatric gliomas including technical implications such as personalized perioperative neurophysiology, surgical strategies, and limitations.; CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these techniques, despite the limitations of some, facilitate the identification of eloquent areas prior to tumor surgery and radiotherapy as well as during follow-up of residual tumors.

N2  -  Individuals vary widely in their ability to orient within the environment. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate whether this ability, as measured by navigational performance in a virtual environment, correlates with the anatomic structural properties of the hippocampus, i.e., fractional anisotropy. We found that individuals with high fractional anisotropy in the right hippocampus are (a) faster in forming a cognitive map of the environment, and (b) more efficient in using this map for the purpose of orientation, than individuals with low fractional anisotropy. These results are consistent with the role of the hippocampus in navigation, and suggest that its microstructural properties may contribute to the intersubject variability observed in spatial orientation.

N2  -  Objective: To assess the inter-hemispheric differences in neuronal function and structure of the motor cortex in a small group of chronic stroke patients having suffered a restricted ischemic lesion affecting hand motor representation. GABAergic intracortical inhibition, known to be affected by stroke lesion, was also investigated.
Methods: Eight patients exhibiting little or no motor impairment were studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) >15 months from diagnosis. Resting motor threshold (MT) for 50 mu V and 2 mV motor evoked potentials, and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were measured from hand muscles. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were analyzed from the DWI for the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA) and thalamus for reflecting changes in neuronal organization.; Results: The MTs did not differ between the affected (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) in 50 mu V responses, while the MTs for 2 mV responses were higher (p = 0.018) in AH. SICI was weakened in AH (p = 0.008). ADCs were higher in the affected M1 compared to the unaffected M1 (p = 0.018) while there were no inter-hemispheric differences in SMA or thalamus.; Conclusions: Inter-hemispheric asymmetry and neuronal organization demonstrated abnormalities in the M1. However, no confident inference can be made whether the observed alterations in neurophysiological and imaging measures have causal role for motor rehabilitation in these patients.; Significance: Neurophysiological changes persist and are detectable using TMS years after stroke even though clinical symptoms have normalized.

T2  -  BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH

N2  -  It has been shown that electrical stimulation of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (IC) at freezing or escape thresholds activates different neural circuits in the brain. Since electrical stimulation activates cell bodies and fibers of passage it is necessary to use chemical stimulation that activates only post-synaptic receptors. To examine this issue in more detail, we took advantage of the fact that GABAergic neurons exert tonic control over the neural substrates of aversion in the IC. Reduction of GABA transmission in this structure was performed with the use of semicarbazide - an inhibitor of the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) - and the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline. Depending on the dose employed local infusions of semicarbazide (6.0 mu g/0.2 mu l) or bicuculline (40 ng/0.2 mu l) into this region caused freezing and escape, respectively. The results obtained showed that freezing behavior induced by semicarbazide was associated with an increase in Fos expression in the dorsomedial column of the PAG (dmPAG) only, while bicuculline-induced escape was related to widespread increase in Fos labeling, notably in the periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus nuclei, amygdaloid nuclei, the laterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (LD), the cuneiform nucleus (CnF) and the locus coeruleus (LD). Thus, the present data support the notion that freezing and escape behaviors induced by GABA blockade in the IC are neurally segregated: acquisition of aversive information of acoustic nature from the IC probably uses the dmPAG column as a relay station to higher brain centers whereas bicuculline-induced escape activates structures involved in both sensory processing and motor output of defensive behavior. These results support the existence of distinct neural circuits mediating the sensory and motor responses of the defense reaction. The extent of the brain activation during freezing appears to be limited to the anatomical connections of the dmPAG, whereas an overall activation of the limbic system predominates during escape behavior induced by IC stimulation.

N2  -  It has been suggested that Gerstmann's syndrome is the result of subcortical disconnection rather than emerging from damage of a multifunctional brain region within the parietal lobe. However, patterns of white matter tract disconnection following parietal damage have been barely investigated. This single case study allows characterising Gerstmann's syndrome in terms of disconnected networks. We report the case of a left parietal patient affected by Gerstmann's tetrad: agraphia, acalculia, left/right orientation problems, and finger agnosia. Lesion mapping, atlas-based estimation of probability of disconnection, and DTI-based tractography revealed that the lesion was mainly located in the superior parietal lobule, and it caused disruption of both intraparietal tracts passing through the inferior parietal lobule (e.g., tracts connecting the angular, supramarginal, postcentral gyri, and the superior parietal lobule) and fronto-parietal long tracts (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus). The lesion site appears to be located more superiorly as compared to the ce-rebral regions shown active by other studies during tasks impaired in the syndrome, and it reached the subcortical area potentially critical in the emergence of the syndrome, as hypothesised in previous studies. Importantly, the reconstruction of tracts connecting regions within the parietal lobe indicates that this critical subcortical area is mainly crossed by white matter tracts connecting the angular gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. Taken together, these findings suggest that this case study might be considered as empirical evidence of Gerstmann's tetrad caused by disconnection of intraparietal white matter tracts.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Background Over the past decade, the functional importance of white matter pathways has been increasingly acknowledged in neurosurgical planning. A method to directly study anatomo-functional correlations is direct electrical stimulation (DES). DES has been widely accepted by neurosurgeons as a reliable tool to minimize the occurrence of permanent postoperative motor, vision, and language deficits. In recent years, DES has also been used for stimulation mapping of other cognitive functions, such as executive functions and visuospatial awareness. Methods The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence so far from DES studies on subcortical pathways that are involved in visuospatial awareness and in the following three executive functions: (1) inhibitory control, (2) working memory, and (3) cognitive flexibility. Results Eleven articles reported on intraoperative electrical stimulation of white matter pathways to map the cognitive functions and explicitly clarified which subcortical tract was stimulated. The results indicate that the right SLF-II is involved in visuospatial awareness, the left SLF-III and possibly the right SLF-I are involved in working memory, and the cingulum is involved in cognitive flexibility. Conclusions We were unable to draw any more specific conclusions, nor unequivocally establish the critical involvement of pathways in executive functions or visuospatial awareness due to the heterogeneity of the study types and methods, and the limited number of studies that assessed these relationships. Possible approaches for future research to obtain converging and more definite evidence for the involvement of pathways in specific cognitive functions are discussed.

N2  -  Arithmetic fact retrieval has been suggested to recruit a left-lateralized network comprising perisylvian language areas, parietal areas such as the angular gyrus (AG), and non-neocortical structures such as the hippocampus. However, the underlying white matter connectivity of these areas has not been evaluated systematically so far. Using simple multiplication problems, we evaluated how disconnections in parietal brain areas affected arithmetic fact retrieval following stroke. We derived disconnectivity measures by jointly considering data from n = 73 patients with acute unilateral lesions in either hemisphere and a white-matter tractography atlas (HCP-842) using the Lesion Quantification Toolbox (LQT). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis indicated a left-hemispheric cluster of white matter fibers connecting the AG and superior temporal areas to be associated with a fact retrieval deficit. Subsequent analyses of direct gray-to-gray matter disconnections revealed that disconnections of additional lefthemispheric areas (e.g., between the superior temporal gyrus and parietal areas) were significantly associated with the observed fact retrieval deficit. Results imply that disconnections of parietal areas (i.e., the AG) with language-related areas (i.e., superior and middle temporal gyri) seem specifically detrimental to arithmetic fact retrieval. This suggests that arithmetic fact retrieval recruits a widespread left-hemispheric network and emphasizes the relevance of white matter connectivity for number processing.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted MR images (DWIs) are believed to correspond accurately with cerebral ischemic events. Intraoperative transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) can reveal hemodynamic and embolic events during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), Our purpose was to determine whether the occurrence of hyperintense signals on postoperative DWIs corresponds to intraoperative embolic or hemodynamic events,
METHODS: Seventy-seven CEAs were monitored intraoperatively with TCD to record blood flow velocity changes after cross clamping to ascertain the presence of adequate collateral flow and to record microembolic signals, DWI was used to classify the hemisphere ipsilateral to the CEA by type: 0, no lesions (n = 51); I, cortical lesions only (n = 2); II, subcortical white matter lesions only (n = 6); III, mixed type with cortical and subcortical lesions (n = 11); IV, large territorial infarcts (n = 6); and V, other types of lesions (n = 1),; RESULTS: Neither the five clinical events (one transient ischemic attack, two minor strokes, and two major strokes) nor any DWI type (I-V) showed at relationship to blood velocity decreases after cross clamping or, in patients who were selectively shunted, to total ischemic time necessary for shunt insertion and removal, Total microembolic signal count was significantly higher in the five CEAs with clinical events than in those without, It was also higher on the DWIs showing a hyperintense lesion as compared with DWIs showing no lesion.; CONCLUSION: Apart from lesions corresponding to clinical deficits, CEA is associated with a substantial number of small areas of brain tissue at risk for irreversible ischemia, The main cause of intraoperative stroke seems to be embolism, suggesting that microembolic signals in CEA are highly relevant events for brain tissue.

T2  -  HEARING RESEARCH

N2  -  Tinnitus is a widespread auditory disorder affecting approximately 10-15% of the population, often with debilitating consequences. Although tinnitus commonly begins with damage to the auditory system due to loud-noise exposure, aging, or other etiologies, the exact neurophysiological basis of chronic tinnitus remains unknown. Many researchers point to a central auditory origin of tinnitus; however, a growing body of evidence also implicates other brain regions, including the limbic system. Correspondingly, we and others have proposed models of tinnitus in which the limbic and auditory systems both play critical roles and interact with one another. Specifically, we argue that damage to the auditory system generates an initial tinnitus signal, consistent with previous research. In our model, this "transient" tinnitus is suppressed when a limbic frontostriatal network, comprised of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, successfully modulates thalamocortical transmission in the auditory system. Thus, in chronic tinnitus, limbic-system damage and resulting inefficiency of auditory limbic interactions prevents proper compensation of the tinnitus signal. Neuroimaging studies utilizing connectivity methods like resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI continue to uncover tinnitus-related anomalies throughout auditory, limbic, and other brain systems. However, directly assessing interactions between these brain regions and networks has proved to be more challenging. Here, we review existing empirical support for models of tinnitus stressing a critical role for involvement of "non-auditory" structures in tinnitus pathophysiology, and discuss the possible impact of newly refined connectivity techniques from neuroimaging on tinnitus research.

N2  -  OBJECT Resection of a motor eloquent lesion has become safer because of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM). Stimulation of subcortical motor evoked potentials (scMEPs) is increasingly used to optimize patient safety. So far, scMEP stimulation has been performed intermittently during resection of eloquently located lesions. Authors of the present study assessed the possibility of using a resection instrument for continuous stimulation of scMEPs.
METHODS An ultrasonic surgical aspirator was attached to an IOM stimulator and was used as a monopolar subcortical stimulation probe. The effect of the aspirator's use at different ultrasound power levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) on stimulation intensity was examined in a saline bath. Afterward monopolar stimulation with the surgical aspirator was used during the resection of subcortical lesions in the vicinity of the corticospinal tract in 14 patients in comparison with scMEP stimulation via a standard stimulation electrode. During resection, the stimulation current at which an MEP response was still measurable with subcortical stimulation using the surgical aspirator was compared with the corresponding stimulation current needed using a standard monopolar subcortical stimulation probe at the same location.; RESULTS The use of ultrasound at different energy levels did result in a slight but irrelevant increase in stimulation energy via the tip of the surgical aspirator in the saline bath. Stimulation of scMEPs using the surgical aspirator or monopolar probe was successful and almost identical in all patients. One patient developed a new permanent neurological deficit. Transient new postoperative paresis was observed in 28% (4 of 14) of cases. Gross-total resection was achieved in 64% (9 of 14) cases and subtotal resection (> 80% of tumor mass) in 35% (5 of 14).; CONCLUSIONS Continuous motor mapping using subcortical stimulation via a surgical aspirator, in comparison with the sequential use of a standard monopolar stimulation probe, is a feasible and safe method without any disadvantages. Compared with the standard probe, the aspirator offers continuous information on the distance to the corticospinal tract.

N2  -  This study aimed at describing the first case of subcortical stimulation of the corticospinal tract leading to selective contraction of the intercostal muscles during surgery for removal of a tumour centred in the right central lobule/supplementary motor area. A 53-year-old male presented with partial motor seizures. Imaging demonstrated a low-grade glioma affecting the posterior aspect of the superior and middle frontal gyri and invading the precentral gyrus. Preoperative motor Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and advanced diffusion tractography were performed to establish the relationship of the tumour with the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. Intraoperative motor mapping and monitoring were performed with monopolar stimulation (train of 5 technique). At the posterior margin of resection, subcortical stimulation demonstrated a selective response from intercostal muscles, medial to responses from the lower limb and lateral to responses from the upper limb. PubMed literature search was performed to identify any case reporting similar findings. There were no cases previously reported in the literature. The location of the subcortical response for intercostal muscles confirms the somatotopy of the corticospinal tract. Intercostal muscles are controlled by selective fibres within the corticospinal tract. Damage to these fibres can lead to paralysis of voluntary respiratory muscles. Further studies are needed to define the cortico-subcortical network controlling voluntary respiratory muscles.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: During brain surgery, there are difficulties associated with identifying subcortical fibers with no clear landmarks. We evaluated the usefulness of cortical evoked potentials with subcortical stimuli (subcortico-cortical evoked potential [SCEP]) in identifying subcortical fibers intraoperatively.
METHODS: We used SCEP to identify the pyramidal tract in 4 patients, arcuate fasciculus in 1 patient, and both in 2 patients during surgical procedures. After resection, a 1 3 4-electrode plate was placed on the floor of the removal cavity and 1-Hz alternating electrical stimuli were delivered to this electrode. A 4 3 5 recording electrode plate was placed on the central cortical areas to map the pyramidal tract and temporoparietal cortical areas for the arcuate fasciculus. SCEPs were obtained by averaging electrocorticograms time locked to the stimulus onset.; RESULTS: The subcortical stimulation within 15 mm of the target fiber induced cortical evoked potentials in the corresponding areas, whereas the stimulation apart from 20 mm did not. Five patients showed transient worsening of neurologic symptoms after surgery. However, all patients recovered.; CONCLUSIONS: SCEP was useful for identifying subcortical fibers and confirmed the preservation of these fibers. This technique is expected to contribute to the effectiveness and safety of resective surgery in patients with lesions close to eloquent areas.

N2  -  Objectives: Recovery of independent ambulation after stroke is a major goal. However, which rehabilitation regimen best benefits each individual is unknown and decisions are currently made on a subjective basis. Predictors of response to specific therapies would guide the type of therapy most appropriate for each patient. Although lesion topography is a strong predictor of upper limb response, walking involves more distributed functions. Earlier studies that assessed the cortico-spinal tract (CST) were negative, suggesting other structures may be important. Experimental Design: The relationship between lesion topography and response of walking speed to standard rehabilitation was assessed in 50 adult-onset patients using both volumetric measurement of CST lesion load and voxel-based lesionsymptom mapping (VLSM) to assess non-CST structures. Two functional mobility scales, the functional ambulation category (FAC) and the modified rivermead mobility index (MRMI) were also administered. Performance measures were obtained both at entry into the study (3-42 days post-stroke) and at the end of a 6-week course of therapy. Baseline score, age, time since stroke onset and white matter hyperintensities score were included as nuisance covariates in regression models. Principal Observations: CST damage independently predicted response to therapy for FAC and MRMI, but not for walk speed. However, using VLSM the latter was predicted by damage to the putamen, insula, external capsule and neighbouring white matter. Conclusions: Walk speed response to rehabilitation was affected by damage involving the putamen and neighbouring structures but not the CST, while the latter had modest but significant impact on everyday functions of general mobility and gait.

N2  -  We describe a method to map whole brain radiation dose distribution on to diffusion tensor MR (DT-MR) fractional anisotropy (FA) images and illustrate its applications for studying dose-effect relationships and regional susceptibility in two childhood medulloblastoma survivors. To determine the FA changes voxel-by-voxel in white matter, the post-treatment follow-up FA maps were coregistered to baseline pretreatment FA maps and automatic segmentation for white matter was carried out. Delta FA maps representing relative FA change in white matter were hence generated for visual inspection and quantitative analysis. The radiation dose distribution, calculated from radiotherapy plan and exported as images, was coregistered to baseline FA images. DT-MR imaging and processing noise was small with root mean square value of 1.49% for mean Delta FA. We evaluated the mean Delta FA changes of regions-of-interest according to radiation dose regions to provide an estimate of the dose-response and found increasing reduction in mean Delta FA with increasing radiation dose up to 45 Gy after which there was a reversal in the mean FA trend and mean FA approached baseline value. We also found more severe mean FA reduction in the frontal lobes compared to the parietal lobes despite the same radiation dose, suggesting regional susceptibility in the frontal lobe, and mean FA increase in the brainstem after radiation in both patients. We conclude that the method described may be useful in estimating dose-effect relationships and studying regional susceptibility of the brain to radiation in medulloblastoma survivors.

N2  -  Focal structural damage to white matter tracts can result in functional deficits in stroke patients. Traditional voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping is commonly used to localize brain structures linked to neurological deficits. Emerging evidence suggests that the impact of structural focal damage may extend beyond immediate lesion sites. In this study, we present a disconnectome mapping approach based on support vector regression (SVR) to identify brain structures and white matter pathways associated with functional deficits in stroke patients. For clinical validation, we utilized imaging data from 340 stroke patients exhibiting motor deficits. A disconnectome map was initially derived from lesions for each patient. Bootstrap sampling was then employed to balance the sample size between a minority group of patients exhibiting right or left motor deficits and those without deficits. Subsequently, SVR analysis was used to identify voxels associated with motor deficits (p < .005). Our disconnectome-based analysis significantly outperformed alternative lesion-symptom approaches in identifying major white matter pathways within the corticospinal tracts associated with upper-lower limb motor deficits. Bootstrapping significantly increased the sensitivity (80%-87%) for identifying patients with motor deficits, with a minimum lesion size of 32 and 235 mm3 for the right and left motor deficit, respectively. Overall, the lesion-based methods achieved lower sensitivities compared with those based on disconnection maps. The primary contribution of our approach lies in introducing a bootstrapped disconnectome-based mapping approach to identify lesion-derived white matter disconnections associated with functional deficits, particularly efficient in handling imbalanced data.

N2  -  PurposeX-map is a non-contrast dual-energy CT (DECT) application to identify acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Our aim was to verify region-specific characteristics of early ischemic changes (EIC) on X-map compared with simulated 120-kVp mixed-CT image and DWI.MethodsFifty AIS patients who underwent DECT and DWI were enrolled (mean age, 76 years; 34 men, 16 women). All datasets including mixed-CT image, X-map, and DWI were transformed into a standard brain atlas with 11 x 2 ROIs based on the ASPECTS + W system. ROIs with EIC on DWI, mixed-CT image, and X-map were defined as DWI-positive, mixed-CT-positive, and X-map-positive, and those with normal finding were DWI-negative, mixed-CT-negative, and X-map-negative respectively, in visual assessment by two neuroradiologists in consensus.ResultsEIC on X-maps were visually relevant to those on the other images: of 221 ROIs with mixed-CT-positive and X-map-positive, 198 (89.6%) were DWI-positive. X-map revealed moderate diagnostic accuracy for AIS compared with DWI in ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.732). X-map identified EIC in deep white matter more sensitively than mixed-CT image: of 15 ROIs with mixed-CT-negative and X-map-positive in W segments, 14 (93.3%) were DWI-positive. X-map often showed EIC in cortical regions that were not detected on the other images: of 67 ROIs with mixed-CT-negative and X-map-positive in I and M1-M6 segments, 47 (70.1%) were DWI-negative.ConclusionsX-map is useful to detect EIC, especially in deep white matter, and may also provide additional information in acute ischemic lesions where DWI cannot be detected.

N2  -  Objective: Establish the evolution of the connectome before and after resection of motor area glioma using a comparison of connectome maps and high-definition differential tractography (DifT). Methods: DifT was done using normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA) with DSI Studio. The quantitative analysis involved obtaining mean NQA and fractional anisotropy (FA) values for the disrupted pathways tracing the corticospinal tract (CST), and white fiber network changes over time. Results: We described the baseline tractography, DifT, and white matter network changes from two patients who underwent resection of an oligodendroglioma (Case 1) and an IDH mutant astrocytoma, grade 4 (Case 2). Case 1. There was a slight decrease in the diffusion signal of the compromised CST in the immediate postop. The NQA and FA values increased at the 1-year follow-up (0.18 vs. 0.32 and 0.35 vs. 0.44, respectively). Case 2. There was an important decrease in the immediate postop, followed by an increase in the follow-up. In the 1-year follow-up, the patient presented with radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence, increasing NQA from 0.18 in the preop to 0.29. Fiber network analysis: whole-brain connectome comparison demonstrated no significant changes in the immediate postop. However, in the 1-year follow up there was a notorious reorganization of the fibers in both cases, showing the decreased density of connections. Conclusions: Connectome studies and DifT constitute new potential tools to predict early reorganization changes in a patient 's networks, showing the brain plasticity capacity, and helping to establish timelines for the progression of the tumor and treatment-induced changes.

N2  -  By implementing a task that closely resembled a clinical test for diagnosing spatial neglect in stroke patients, Himmelbach et al. (: Neuroimage 32:1747-1759) found significantly increased activation during active exploration in those cortical areas in healthy subjects that are known to induce spatial neglect in case of a lesion. The present study investigated whether direct intra-hemispheric cortico-cortical connections could be found between these activated clusters using a probabilistic fiber-tracking approach in 52 healthy subjects. We found that parts of the extreme capsule (EmC) and the middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) connected the functional cluster in the prefrontal cortex with the superior temporal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) area in both hemispheres. The activation peak in the TPJ was additionally connected to the inferior frontal cortex by parts of the arcuate fascicle and the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF II) in the right hemisphere. Our study elucidates the connections constituting the perisylvian network for spatial orienting and attention. Hence, we complement the knowledge from patients suffering from spatial neglect by giving first empirical evidence for the complete postulated network in healthy subjects.

N2  -  Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate connectivity modifications in the Default Mode Network (DMN) in patients with cerebral glioma, and to correlate these modifications to tumor characteristics.
Methods: Twenty-four patients with a left-hemisphere cerebral tumor (14 grade II and 10 grade IV gliomas) and 14 healthy age-matched right-hand volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subjects underwent fMRI while performing language tasks for presurgical mapping. Data was analyzed with independent component analysis in order to identify the DMN. DMN group maps were produced by random-effect analysis (p<0.001, FDR-corrected). An analysis of variance across the three groups (p<0.05) and post-hoc t-test contrasts between pairs of groups were calculated (p<0.05, FDR-corrected).; Results: All three groups showed typical DMN areas. However, reduced DMN connectivity was detected in tumor patients with respect to controls. A significantly increased and reduced integration of DMN areas was observed in the hippocampal and prefrontal regions, respectively. Modifications were closely related to tumor grading. Moreover, the DMN lateralized to the hemisphere contralateral to tumor in the low-grade, but not in the high-grade tumor patients.; Conclusion: Modifications of DMN connectivity were induced by gliomas and differed for high and low grade tumors.

N2  -  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive central nervous system tumor associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to depict the role of intraoperative imaging techniques in GBM surgery and how they can ensure the maximal extent of resection (EOR) while preserving the functional outcome. The authors conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines on the PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases. A total of 1747 articles were identified for screening. Studies focusing on GBM-affected patients, and evaluations of EOR and functional outcomes with the aid of advanced image-guided techniques were included. The resulting studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tool. Open Science Framework registration DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/3FDP9. Eighteen studies were eligible for this systematic review. Among the selected studies, eight analyzed Sodium Fluorescein, three analyzed 5-aminolevulinic acid, two evaluated IoMRI imaging, two evaluated IoUS, and three evaluated multiple intraoperative imaging techniques. A total of 1312 patients were assessed. Gross Total Resection was achieved in the 78.6% of the cases. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 52 months. All studies assessed the functional outcome based on the Karnofsky Performance Status scale, while one used the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology score. In 77.7% of the cases, the functional outcome improved or was stable over the pre-operative assessment. Combining multiple intraoperative imaging techniques could provide better results in GBM surgery than a single technique. However, despite good surgical outcomes, patients often present a neurocognitive decline leading to a marked deterioration of the quality of life. Advanced intraoperative image-guided techniques can allow a better understanding of the anatomo-functional relationships between the tumor and the surrounding brain, thus maximizing the EOR while preserving functional outcomes.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor (DT) images can provide information about the nature of white matter changes, including axonal loss and demyelination. We applied DT imaging to verify white matter changes in patients with malignant phenylketonuria (PKU) and to correlate the findings with clinical intelligence quotients (IQs).
METHODS: We compared DT images with T2-weighted images in 12 patients with early-treated, chronic, stable malignant PKU and 12 age-matched control subjects. DT parameters included first, second, and third eigenvalues (EV1-3), apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), and fractional anisotropy (FA). Regions of interest were placed the frontoparietal, parietooccipital, frontal and central white matter and in the anterior and posterior corpus callosum. Eight patients older than 3 years underwent IQ assessment including verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ tests.; RESULTS: In the eight patients older than 3 years, no definite abnormal signal intensity changes were found on T2-weighted images. EV2, EV3, and FA of the parieto-occipital white matter were significantly different in patients and control subjects older than 3 years. EV3 and ADC of the parieto-occipital white matter were significantly and negatively correlated with verbal IQ (r = -0.79, P = .04) and performance IQ (r = -0.93, P = .03). FA of the parieto-occipital central white matter was positively correlated with verbal IQ (r = 0.75, P = .05).; CONCLUSION. Though treated early, patients with chronic, stable malignant PKU had abnormal DT findings in the parieto-occipital central white matter. EV2, EV3, and FA maps are potential tools for demonstrating brain changes due to malignant PKU.

N2  -  Introduction: Resection of intra-axial tumors (IaT) in eloquent brain regions risks major postoperative neurological deficits. Awake craniotomy is often used to navigate these areas; however, some patients are ineligible for awake procedures. The trans-sulcal approach (TScal) was introduced to reduce parenchymal trauma during tumor resection. We report our experiences utilizing TScal for resection of deep IaT located in eloquent areas. Materials and Methods: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of patients who underwent IaT resection in eloquent areas via TScal from January 2013 to April 2021. Seventeen cases were reviewed, and relevant data was collected. Fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and intraoperative ultrasound was performed in some cases. Results: Seventeen patients (10 males, 7 females) averaging 61.2 years-old (range, 21-76) were included in this study. Average length of stay was 4.8 days, and only 2 patients (11.8%) required hospital readmission within 30 days. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 15 patients (88.2%), while subtotal resection occurred in 2 patients (11.8%). Eleven patients (64.7%) reported full resolution of symptoms, 4 patients (23.5%) reported deficit improvement, and 2 patients (11.8%) experienced no change from their preoperative deficits. No patient developed new permanent deficits postoperatively. Discussion: GTR, preoperative deficit reduction, and complications were comparable to awake craniotomy and other TScal studies. Ancillary intraoperative techniques, such as brain mapping, 5-ALA and intraoperative ultrasound, are afforded by TScal to improve resection rates and overall outcomes. Conclusions: TScal can be an option for patients with deep lesions in eloquent areas who are not candidates for awake surgeries.

N2  -  Purpose: To develop a multicompartmental signal model for whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apply it to study the diffusion properties of normal tissue and metastatic prostate cancer bone lesions in vivo.Materials and Methods: This prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03440554) included 139 men with prostate cancer (mean age, 70 years +/- 9 [SD]). Multicompartmental models with two to four tissue compartments were fit to DWI data from whole-body scans to determine optimal compartmental diffusion coefficients. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and model-fitting residuals were calculated to quantify model complexity and goodness of fit. Diffusion coefficients for the optimal model (having lowest BIC) were used to compute compartmental signal-contribution maps. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) of bone lesions to normal-appearing bone was measured on these signal-contribution maps and on conventional DWI scans and compared using paired t tests (alpha = .05). Two-sample t tests (alpha = .05) were used to compare compartmental signal fractions between lesions and normal-appearing bone.Results: Lowest BIC was observed from the four-compartment model, with optimal compartmental diffusion coefficients of 0, 1.1 x 10(-3), 2.8 x 10(-3), and > 3.0 x10(-2) mm(2)/sec. Fitting residuals from this model were significantly lower than from conventional apparent diffusion coefficient mapping (P < .001). Bone lesion SIR was significantly higher on signal-contribution maps of model compart-ments 1 and 2 than on conventional DWI scans (P < .008). The fraction of signal from compartments 2, 3, and 4 was also significantly different between metastatic bone lesions and normal-appearing bone tissue (P & LE; .02).Conclusion: The four-compartment model best described whole-body diffusion properties. Compartmental signal contributions from this model can be used to examine prostate cancer bone involvement.Clinical trial registration no.

N2  -  Gliomas are a major cause of morbidity. Direct cortical stimulation mapping offers the ability to identify functional areas within the broader neural network both cortically and subcortically. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification categorized gliomas into molecular subgroups with varied molecular signatures and clinical behavior, it is possible that gliomas may demonstrate rates of functional network integration. We therefore retrospectively reviewed a data registry of 181 patients with dominant hemisphere frontal, parietal, insular, or temporal gliomas. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that WHO glioma histopathology and molecular subtype influences functional language or motor sites identified within the tumor. Intratumoral function as determined by direct cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping was identified at the highest rate in isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Finally, we reviewed the emerging literature exploring the interface between functional neural networks and gliomas. These data shed light on glioma molecular and histological characteristics most commonly associated within intratumoral function.

N2  -  ObjectivesTo ascertain the neural network mediating reading using intraoperative electrostimulation.
Experimental designA cortical and axonal intraoperative electrical mapping of reading processes was achieved in seven patients who underwent awake surgery for a left occipitotemporal glioma. We performed resection cavity overlapping and superimposition with a diffusion tensor imaging-based white matter atlas. We assessed the relationship between the location of resection cavities and the occurrence of reading impairments of regular, irregular, and pseudowords.; Principal observationsIntraoperative stimulation of the left posterior inferior temporal cortex (ITCp) elicited reading disturbances. Subcortical stimulation at the anterior portion of the visual word form area (VWFA) induced addressed phonology (irregular words reading) disturbances. Subcortical stimulation of the connection between VWFA and the posterior segment of the arcuate fascicle (AFp) induced both addressed and assembled phonology (irregular and pseudowords reading) disturbances. Postoperative assessment showed that resection of the posterior portion of the inferior longitudinal fascicle (ILFp), connecting the visual cortex to VWFA, induced long-term and global reading impairment. Resection of the terminations of left AFp in the ITCp-induced irregular and pseudowords reading disturbances with no impairment of regular words reading. Resection of the anterior portion of ILF did not induce reading impairment.; ConclusionsOur data support an inner posterior-to-anterior hierarchical coding of letter strings in the VWFA and a crucial role of the left ILFp to provide visual inputs to the VWFA. Furthermore, we suggest that the AFp is involved in an interactive feedback system between visual and nonvisual information, recruited when reading irregular and pseudowords.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome evaluation in clinical oncology is conventionally based on long-term volumetric changes in the tumor size. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the usefulness of fDMs in incorporating anisotropic diffusion in the evaluation of early response after radiosurgery in patients with vestibular schwannoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MID, FA, and IVDC were calculated by using simple averaging methods and fDMs. Six patients with vestibular schwannoma treated with stereotactic radiosurgery underwent longitudinal DTI studies on a 3T MR imaging scanner (maximum follow-up, 6 months), Posttreatment DTI data were spatially coregistered with pretreatment scans.; RESULTS: Tumors did not change significantly in size until 6 months after treatment. Diffusion indices changed significantly during the study period. There was a transient decrease in averaged MD followed by a significant increase. IVDC showed an opposite behavior compared with MD. FA decreased continuously throughout the study period. Functional diffusion maps showed a heterogeneous response of tumors to treatment, thereby providing complementary information to simple averaged values.; CONCLUSIONS: DTI allows early detection of therapeutic-induced changes in patients with vestibular schwannoma. Functional diffusion maps incorporating anisotropic diffusion may aid in assessing the heterogeneity of the therapeutic response in this patient group.

N2  -  In 14 cats there was a total of 23 bipolar stimulating electrodes successfully implanted in the pulvinar (Pul) complex. An aversive response to ipsilateral intracranial stimulation (ICS) beginning with 0.25 mA occurred in all cases and the majority of cats learned to escape the painful stimulus delivered on at least 1 side by crossing a shuttle box barrier. After this behavior was well established, lesions were made ipsilaterally through the same electrodes. In the postlesion trials the animals no longer responded to the ICS at currents < 100% above the prelesion intensities. Upon completion of the postlesion trials, the nonlesion side was subjected to ICS and never showed a nociceptive block due to the contralateral lesion. Then the animal received a 2nd similar lesion through the electrode and was again subjected to a postlesion trial series. In 8 cases an auditory negative reinforcer was introduced prior to the noxious ICS and when associated with avoidance this preferential response was retained after the lesions. Not infrequently, the primary pain responses were expressed as, or associated with, affective (savage) behavior, ocular, or other extrapyramidal motor responses. Histological evaluation showed an essentially equal distribution of the electrode tips in the medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei, suprageniculate nucleus, and 2 in the magnocellular part of the medial geniculate body. In brains where the deOlmos-Ingram Ag stain was used to trace axonal degeneration, there were always heavy axonal and terminal projections to the reticular nucleus. The fibers then continued through the internal capsule to spread and end in the medial suprasylvian and ectosylvian gyri. Other significant subcortical projections to the pretectal region, central gray, nucleus centromedianus and the zona incerta were observed.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Globus pallidus (GP) lesioning improves motor symptoms of Parkinson???s disease (PD) and is occasionally associated with nonmotor side effects. Although these variable clinical effects were shown to be site-specific within the GP, the motor and nonmotor subregions have not been distinguished radiologically in patients with PD. The GP was recently found to have a distinct radiological signature on diffusion MRI (dMRI), potentially related to its unique cellular content and organization (or tissue architecture). In this study, the authors hypothesize that the magnitude of water diffusivity, a surrogate for tissue architecture, will radiologically distinguish motor from nonmotor GP subregions in patients with PD. They also hypothesize that the therapeutic focused ultrasound pallidotomy lesions will preferentially overlap the motor subregion. METHODS Diffusion MRI from healthy subjects (n = 45, test-retest S1200 cohort) and PD patients (n = 33) was parcellated based on the magnitude of water diffusivity in the GP, as measured orientation distribution function (ODF). A clustering algorithm was used to identify GP parcels with distinct ODF magnitude. The individual parcels were used as seeds for tractography to distinguish motor from nonmotor subregions. The locations of focused ultrasound lesions relative to the GP parcels were also analyzed in 11 patients with PD. RESULTS Radiologically, three distinct parcels were identified within the GP in healthy controls and PD patients: posterior, central, and anterior. The posterior and central parcels comprised the motor subregion and the anterior parcel was classified as a nonmotor subregion based on their tractography connections. The focused ultrasound lesions preferentially overlapped with the motor subregion (posterior more than central). The hotspots for motor improvement were localized in the posterior GP parcel. CONCLUSIONS Using a data-driven approach of ODF-based parcellation, the authors radiologically distinguished GP motor subregions in patients with PD. This method can aid stereotactic targeting in patients with PD undergoing surgical treatments, especially focused ultrasound ablation.

N2  -  Recent neurophysiological studies indicate a role for reticulospinal neurons of the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) in motor preparation and goal-directed reaching in the monkey. Although the macaque monkey is an important model for such investigations, little is known regarding the organization of the PMRF in the monkey. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of reticulospinal neurons in the macaque. Bilateral injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were made into the cervical spinal cord. A wide band of retrogradely labeled cells was found in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus (Gi) and labeled cells continued rostrally into the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC) and into the oral pontine reticular nucleus (PnO). Additional retrograde tracing studies following unilateral cervical spinal cord injections of cholera toxin subunit B revealed that there were more ipsilateral (60%) than contralateral (40%) projecting cells in Gi, while an approximately 50:50 ratio contralateral to ipsilateral split was found in PnC and more contralateral projections arose from PnO. Reticulospinal neurons in PMRF ranged widely in size from over 50 mu m to under 25 mu m across the major somatic axis. Labeled giant cells (soma diameters greater than 50 mu m) comprised a small percentage of the neurons and were found in Gi, PnC and PnO. The present results define the origins of the reticulospinal system in the monkey and provide an important foundation for future investigations of the anatomy and physiology of this system in primates.

N2  -  Object. Thalamopeduncular tumors arise at the junction of the inferior thalamus and cerebral peduncle and present with a common clinical syndrome of progressive spastic hemiparesis. Pathologically, these lesions are usually juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and are best treated with resection with the intent to cure. The goals of this study are to define a common clinical syndrome produced by thalamopeduncular tumors and to discuss imaging characteristics as well as surgical adjuncts, intraoperative nuances, and postoperative complications relating to the resection of these neoplasms.
Methods. The authors present a retrospective review of their experience with 10 children presenting between 3 and 15 years of age with a thalamopeduncular syndrome. Formal preoperative MR imaging was obtained in all patients, and diffusion tensor (DT) imaging was performed in 9 patients. Postoperative MR imaging was obtained to evaluate the extent of tumor resection. A prospective analysis of clinical outcomes was then conducted by the senior author.; Results. Pilocytic astrocytoma was the pathological diagnosis in 9 cases, and the other was fibrillary astrocytoma. Seven of 9 pilocytic astrocytomas were completely resected. Radical surgery was avoided in 1 child after DT imaging revealed that the corticospinal tract (CST) coursed through the center of the tumor, consistent with the infiltrative nature of fibrillary astrocytoma as identified by stereotactic biopsy. In 8 patients, tractography served as an important adjunct for designing a surgical approach that spared the CST. In 6 cases the CSTs were pushed anterolaterally, making a transsylvian approach a poor choice, as was evidenced by the first patient in the series, who underwent operation prior to the advent of tractography, and who awoke with a dense contralateral hemiparesis. Thus, subsequent patients with this deviation pattern underwent a transcortical approach via the middle temporal gyrus. One patient exhibited medial deviation of the tracts and another had lateral deviation, facilitating a transtemporal and a transfrontal approach, respectively.; Conclusions. The thalamopeduncular syndrome of progressive spastic hemiparesis presenting in children with or without symptoms of headache should alert the examiner to the possibility of a tumoral involvement of CSTs. Preoperative tractography is a useful adjunct to surgical planning in tumors that displace motor pathways. Gross-total resection of pilocytic astrocytornas usually results in cure, and therefore should be entertained when developing a treatment strategy for thalamopeduncular tumors of childhood.

N2  -  High resolution, dynamic GdDTPA-enhanced images of MCF7 human breast tumors in immunodeficient mice were analyzed at pixel resolution. The analysis, based on a physiological model, was performed by applying a nonlinear least-square algorithm using a color coded scale. The final output mapped at pixel resolution capillary permeability times surface area and fraction of extracellular volume, for each tumor slice. In addition, the output included assessment of the fit to the model by determining the proportion of variability (R-2) for each pixel. The spatial variation in the R-2 values served to identify regions where the predominant mechanism of enhancement was leakage from the intravascular volume to the extracellular volume (R-2 close to 1). In regions with low R-2 Other mechanisms of enhancement appear to be dominating presumably diffusion within the extracellular space. As expected, in necrotic regions lacking microcapillaries and identified by analyzing T-2-weighted images of the same tumors, the model failed to fit the dynamic contrast enhanced data. The heterogeneous distribution of the determined pathophysiological features demonstrates the importance of recording and analyzing breast tumor images at high spatial resolution.

N2  -  Introduction. - Intraoperative application of electrical current to the brain is a standard technique during brain surgery for inferring the function of the underlying brain. The purpose of intraoperative functional mapping is to reliably identify cortical areas and subcortical pathways involved in eloquent functions, especially motor, sensory, language and cognitive functions.
Material and methods. - The aim of this article is to review the rationale and the electrophysiological principles of the use of direct bipolar electrostimulation for cortical and subcortical mapping under awake conditions.; Results. - Direct electrical stimulation is a window into the whole functional network that sustains a particular function. It is an accurate (spatial resolution of about 5 mm) and a reproducible technique particularly adapted to clinical practice for brain resection in eloquent areas. If the procedure is rigorously applied, the sensitivity of direct electrical stimulation for the detection of cortical and subcortical eloquent areas is nearly 100%. The main disadvantage of this technique is its suboptimal specificity. Another limitation is the identification of eloquent areas during surgery, which, however, could have been functionally compensated postoperatively if removed surgically.; Conclusion. - Direct electrical stimulation is an easy, accurate, reliable and safe invasive technique for the intraoperative detection of both cortical and subcortical functional brain connectivity for clinical purpose. In our opinion, it is the optimal technique for minimizing the risk of neurological sequelae when resecting in eloquent brain areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) can negatively impact quality of life and health. For clinicians and researchers seeking to improve outcomes for patients with dysphagia, understanding the neural control of swallowing is critical. The role of gray matter in swallowing control has been extensively documented, but knowledge is limited regarding the contributions of white matter. Our aim was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the populations, methods, and results of published articles describing the role of white matter in neural control of swallowing. Methods: We completed a systematic review with a multi-engine search following PRISMA-P 2015 standards. Two authors screened articles and completed blind full-text review and quality assessments using an adapted U.S. National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment. The senior author resolved any disagreements. Qualitative synthesis of evidence was completed. Results: The search yielded 105 non-duplicate articles, twenty-two of which met inclusion criteria. Twenty were rated as Good (5/22; 23%) or Fair (15/22; 68%) quality. Stroke was the most represented diagnosis (n = 20; 91%). All studies were observational, and half were retrospective cohort design. The majority of studies (13/22; 59%) quantified white matter damage with lesion-based methods, whereas 7/22 (32%) described intrinsic characteristics of white matter using methods like fractional anisotropy. Fifteen studies (68%) used instrumental methods for swallowing evaluations. White matter areas commonly implicated in swallowing control included the pyramidal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum. Additional noteworthy themes included: severity of white matter damage is related to dysphagia severity; bilateral white matter lesions appear particularly disruptive to swallowing; and white matter adaptation can facilitate dysphagia recovery. Gaps in the literature included limited sample size and populations, lack of in-depth evaluations, and issues with research design. Conclusion: Although traditionally understudied, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that white matter is critical in the neural control of swallowing. The reviewed studies indicated that white matter damage can be directly tied to swallowing deficits, and several white matter structures were implicated across studies. Further well-designed interdisciplinary research is needed to understand white matter's role in neural control of normal swallowing and in dysphagia recovery and rehabilitation.

N2  -  Background: Recording of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) is used during navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) motor mapping to locate motor function in the human brain. However, factors potentially underlying MEP latency variability in neurosurgical motor mapping are vastly unknown. In the context of this study, one hundred brain tumor patients underwent preoperative nTMS-based motor mapping of the tumor hemisphere between 2010 and 2013. Fourteen predefined predictor variables were recorded, and MEP latencies of abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB), abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM), and flexor carpi radialis muscle (FCR) were analyzed using linear mixed-effect multiple regression analysis with the forward step-wise model comparison approach.
Results: Common factors (relevant to APB, ADM, and FCR) for MEP latency variability were gender, most likely due to body height, and antiepileptic drug (AED) intake. Muscle-specific factors (relevant to APB, ADM, or FCR) for MEP latency variability were resting motor threshold (rMT), tumor side, and tumor location.; Conclusions: Based on a large cohort of neurosurgical patients, this study provides data on a wide range of clinical factors that may underlie MEP latency variability. The factors that significantly contributed to MEP latency variability should be standardly recorded and taken into consideration during neurosurgical motor mapping.

N2  -  Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (FCMS) is a rare type of suprabulbar palsy characterized by an automatic-voluntary dissociation of the orofacial musculature. Here, the authors report an original case of FCMS that occurred intraoperatively while resecting the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus.
This 25-year-old right-handed man with an incidentally diagnosed right frontotemporoinsular tumor underwent surgery using an asleep-awake-asleep technique with direct cortical and subcodical electrical stimulation and a transopercular approach to the insula. While resecting the anterior part of the pars opercularis the patient suffered sudden anarthria and bilateral facial weakness. He was unable to speak or show his teeth on command, but he was able to voluntarily move his upper and lower limbs. This syndrome lasted for 8 days. Postoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography revealed that connections of the pars opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus with the frontal aslant tract (FAT) and arcuate fasciculus (AF) were damaged.; This case supplies evidence for localizing the structural substrate of FCMS. It was possible, for the first time in the literature, to accurately correlate the occurrence of FCMS to the resection of connections between the FAT and AF, and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. The FAT has been recently described, but it may be an important connection to mediate supplementary motor area control of orofacial movement. The present case also contributes to our knowledge of complication avoidance in operculoinsular surgery. A transopercular approach to insuloopercular gliomas can generate FCMS, especially in cases of previous contralateral lesions. The prognosis is favorable, but the patient should be informed of this particular hazard, and the surgeon should anticipate the surgical strategy in case the syndrome occurs intraoperatively in an awake patient.

N2  -  Spatial reasoning has a relevant role in mathematics and helps daily computational activities. It is widely assumed that in cultures with left-to-right reading, numbers are organized along the mental equivalent of a ruler, the mental number line, with small magnitudes located to the left of larger ones. Patients with right brain damage can disregard smaller numbers while mentally setting the midpoint of number intervals. This has been interpreted as a sign of spatial neglect for numbers on the left side of the mental number line and taken as a strong argument for the intrinsic left-to-right organization of the mental number line. Here, we put forward the understanding of this cognitive disability by discovering that patients with right brain damage disregard smaller numbers both when these are mapped on the left side of the mental number line and on the right side of an imagined clock face. This shows that the right hemisphere supports the representation of small numerical magnitudes independently from their mapping on the left or the right side of a spatial-mental layout. In addition, the study of the anatomical correlates through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and the mapping of lesion peaks on the diffusion tensor imaging-based reconstruction of white matter pathways showed that the rightward bias in the imagined clock-face was correlated with lesions of high-level middle temporal visual areas that code stimuli in object-centred spatial coordinates, i.e. stimuli that, like a clock face, have an inherent left and right side. In contrast, bias towards higher numbers on the mental number line was linked to white matter damage in the frontal component of the parietal-frontal number network. These anatomical findings show that the human brain does not represent the mental number line as an object with an inherent left and right side. We conclude that the bias towards higher numbers in the mental bisection of number intervals does not depend on left side spatial, imagery or object-centred neglect and that it rather depends on disruption of an abstract non-spatial representation of small numerical magnitudes.

N2  -  Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are known to have key roles in embryonic growth and morphogenesis, but their presence and contributions to fetal development are unclear. In particular, little information exists as to the relevance of FGF and their specific receptors to human fetal development. We studied the anatomical distribution of messenger RNA encoding FGF-2 and one of its high affinity receptors, FGFR1, using in situ hybridization in a variety of human fetal tissues in early second trimester. Corresponding protein distributions were determined by immunohistochemistry. Both FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and proteins were found to be present in every organ and tissue examined, but with defined cellular localizations. In skeletal muscle, both FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and peptides were present in differentiated fibers, and both co-localized to proliferating chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth plate. FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and peptides were also present within cardiac or gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Within the gastrointestinal tract FGF-2 mRNA and peptide were located in the submucosal tissue, whereas FGFR1 was expressed within the overlying mucosa. Similarly, in skin, FGF-2 was expressed within the dermis whereas FGFR1 mRNA and peptide were most apparent in the stratum germinativum of the epidermis. In kidney and lung, FGFR1 mRNA was located in the tubular and alveolar epithelia respectively, whereas FGF-2 was expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations. Both growth factor and receptor were widespread in both neuroblasts and glioblasts in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Immunoreactivity for FGF-2 and FGFR1 was seen in all vascular endothelial cells of major vessels and capillaries. Within the skin, kidney, lung, and intestine FGF-2 immunoreactivity was found in basement membranes underlying epithelia, and was associated with the extracellular matrix and plasma membranes of many cell types. The results show that FGF-2 and one of its receptors are widely expressed anatomically in the mid-trimester human fetus.

N2  -  Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) activity was demonstrated in crude extracts of the hypothalamus of several teleost species. Teleost GnRH is similar to the GnRH in elasmobranchs, reptiles and birds. LHRH or its superactive analogs stimulate gonadotropin (GtH) secretion in teleosts and can induce ovulation. The actions of LHRH or its analogs can be self-potentiated or self-suppressed by previous exposure to low and high doses, respectively, and the fish may also be able to modulate its response by other means. There is no agreement on the distribution in the brain of LHRH immunoreactive perikarya and nerve fibers in teleosts, but the main sites for perikarya are the nucleus lateral tuberis (NLT), preoptic region and telencephalon. Lesioning the NLT by electrical current or monosodium L-glutamate demonstrates that it has functional involvement in the stimulation of GtH release, presumably via GnRH. The NLT and pineal are involved in regulation of daily cycles of GtH secretion, which have importance in stimulating gonadal activity. A GtH release-inhibitory factor (GRIF) apparently originates in the anteroventral preoptic region. Abolition of GRIF action on the pituitary by destruction of its origin or its neural pathways to the pituitary cause very high serum levels of GtH in sexually mature females and males, and ovulation of the females; regulation of the ovulatory surge of secretion of GtH probably involves abatement of GRIF and stimulation by GnRH. Sex steroids have a negative feedback effect during gonadal recrudescence; the greatest negative feedback influence is during the spawning period. In sexually immature fish estrogens and androgens aromatizable to estrogens have a positive feedback effect to stimulate accumulation of GtH in the pituitary; this positive feedback effect may be part of the mechanism of onset of sexual maturity or gonadal recrudescence in teleosts. Binding sites in the brain for sex steroids were investigated by autoradiography, and active locations were found in the NLT, preoptic region, area ventralis of the telencephalon, and parts of the posterior hypothalamus, and the pituitary. The functional significance of most of these binding sites is not known.

N2  -  In preoperative planning for neurosurgery, both anatomical (diffusion imaging tractography) and functional tools (MR-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation) are increasingly used to identify and preserve eloquent language structures specific to individuals. Using these tools in healthy adults shows that speech production errors occur mainly in perisylvian cortical sites that correspond to subject-specific terminations of the major language pathway, the arcuate fasciculus. It is not clear whether this correspondence remains in oncological patients with altered tissue. We studied a heterogeneous cohort of 30 patients (fourteen male, mean age 44), undergoing a first or second surgery for a left hemisphere brain tumour in a language-eloquent region, to test whether speech production errors induced by preoperative transcranial magnetic stimulation had consistent anatomical correspondence to the arcuate fasciculus. We used navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during picture naming and recorded different perisylvian sites where transient interference to speech production occurred. Spherical deconvolution diffusion imaging tractography was performed to map the direct fronto-temporal and indirect (fronto-parietal and parieto-temporal) segments of the arcuate fasciculus in each patient. Speech production errors were reported in all patients when stimulating the frontal lobe, and in over 90% of patients in the parietal lobe. Errors were less frequent in the temporal lobe (54%). In all patients, at least one error site corresponded to a termination of the arcuate fasciculus, particularly in the frontal and parietal lobes, despite distorted anatomy due to a lesion and/or previous resection. Our results indicate that there is strong correspondence between terminations of the arcuate fasciculus and speech errors. This indicates that white matter anatomy may be a robust marker for identifying functionally eloquent cortex, particularly in the frontal and parietal lobe. This knowledge may improve targets for preoperative mapping of language in the neurosurgical setting.

N2  -  The benefit of carotid revascularization in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis is hampered by the risk of stroke due to the intervention itself. The risk of periprocedural strokes is higher for carotid artery stenting (CAS) as compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Over the past years, the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for periprocedural stroke seems to unfold step by step. Initially, all procedural strokes were thought to be the result of technical errors during surgical repair: cerebral ischemia due to clamping time of the carotid artery', cerebral embolization of atherosclerotic debris due to manipulation of the atheroma or thrombosis of the artery. Following improvements in surgical techniques, technical skills, new intraoperative monitoring technologies such as angioscopy. and the results of the first large clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) it was believed that most periprocedural strokes were of thromboembolic nature, while a large part of these caused by technical error. Nowadays, analyses of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of procedural stroke make a clinically relevant distinction between intra-procedural and postprocedural strokes. Intra-procedural stroke is defined as hypoperfusion due to clamping (CEA) or dilatation (CAS) and embolization from the carotid plaque (both CEA and CAS). Postprocedural stroke can be caused by thrombo-embolisation but seems to have a primarily hemodynamic origin. Besides thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) due to extensively increased cerebral revascularization is the most reported pathophysiological mechanism of postprocedural stroke. Multiple technical improvements have attempted to lower the risk of periprocedural stroke. The introduction of antiplatelet therapy (APT) has significantly reduced the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with carotid stenosis. Over the years, recommendations regarding APT changed. While for a long time APT was discontinued prior to surgery because of a fear of increased bleeding risk, nowadays continuation of APT during carotid intervention (aspirin monotherapy or even dual APT including clopidogrel) is found to be safe and effective. In CAS patients, dual APT up to three months' postprocedural is considered best. Stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) for CAS procedure are continuously under development. Trials have suggested a benefit of closed-cell stent design over open-cell stent design in order to reduce procedural stroke, while the benefit of CPD during stenting is still a matter of debate. Although CPD reduce the risk of procedural stroke, a higher number of new ischemic brain lesions detected on diffusion weighted imaging was found in patients treated with CPD. In patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia, adequate use of cerebral monitoring (EEG and transcranial Doppler [TCD]) has reduced the number of intraoperative stroke by detecting embolization and thereby guiding the surgeon to adjust his technique or to selectively shunt the carotid artery. In addition, TCD is able to adequately identify and exclude patients at risk for CHS. For CAS, the additional value of periproceduml cerebral monitoring to prevent strokes needs urgent attention. In conclusion, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiological mechanism of stroke following carotid revascularization (both CAS and CEA) and of the technical improvements that have contributed to reducing this stroke risk.

N2  -  Simulating transcranial electric stimulation is actively researched as knowledge about the distribution of the electrical field is decisive for understanding the variability in the elicited stimulation effect. Several software pipelines comprehensively solve this task in an automated manner for standard use-cases. However, simulations for non-standard applications such as uncommon electrode shapes or the creation of head models from non-optimized T1-weighted imaging data and the inclusion of irregular structures are more difficult to accomplish. We address these limitations and suggest a comprehensive workflow to simulate transcranial electric stimulation based on open-source tools. The workflow covers the head model creation from MRI data, the electrode modeling, the modeling of anisotropic conductivity behavior of the white matter, the numerical simulation and visualization. Skin, skull, air cavities, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray matter are segmented semi-automatically from T1-weighted MR images. Electrodes of arbitrary number and shape can be modeled. The meshing of the head model is implemented in a way to preserve the feature edges of the electrodes and is free of topological restrictions of the considered structures of the head model. White matter anisotropy can be computed from diffusion-tensor imaging data. Our solver application was verified analytically and by contrasting the tDCS simulation results with that of other simulation pipelines (SimNIBS 3.0, ROAST 3.0). An agreement in both cases underlines the validity of our workflow. Our suggested solutions facilitate investigations of irregular structures in patients (e.g. lesions, implants) or new electrode types. For a coupled use of the described workflow, we provide documentation and disclose the full source code of the developed tools.

N2  -  ObjectiveSubcortical stroke can cause a variety of language deficits. However, the neural mechanisms underlying subcortical aphasia after stroke remain incompletely elucidated. We aimed to determine the effects of distant cortical structures on aphasia outcomes and examine the correlation of cortical thickness measures with connecting tracts integrity after chronic left subcortical stroke. MethodsThirty-two patients and 30 healthy control subjects underwent MRI scanning and language assessment with the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) subtests. Among patients, the cortical thickness in brain regions that related to language performance were assessed by the FreeSurfer software. Fiber tracts connecting the identified cortical regions to stroke lesions were reconstructed to determine its correlations with the cortical thickness measures across individual patient. ResultsCortical thickness in different parts of the left fronto-temporo-parietal (FTP) regions were positively related to auditory-verbal comprehension, spontaneous speech and naming/word finding abilities when controlling for key demographic variables and lesion size. Cortical thickness decline in the identified cortical regions was positively correlated with integrity loss of fiber tracts connected to stroke lesions. Additionally, no significant difference in cortical thickness was found across the left hemisphere between the subgroup of patients with hypoperfusion (HP) and those without HP at stroke onset. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that remote cortical atrophy independently predicts language outcomes in patients with chronic left subcortical stroke and aphasia and that cortical thinning in these regions might relate to integrity loss of fiber tracts connected to stroke lesions.

N2  -  1. The synaptic activation by messy fibers (MFs) of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in the vestibular cerebellum (nodulus and uvula) was examined using patch-clamp recording methods in thin, rat cerebellar slices with Lucifer yellow-filled pipettes for subsequent fluorescence microscopic verification of the cell morphology.
2. UBCs were distinguished from adjacent granule cells in thin cerebellar slices in the uvula and nodulus regions by their larger soma diameters and short dendritic brush, greater whole-cell capacitance, and a prolonged, biphasic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) to stimulation of MFs.; 3. Thin-section transmission electron micrographs of the MF-UBC synapse displayed an unusually extensive area of synaptic apposition estimated to measure 12-40 mu m(2). The majority of UBCs was innervated by a single MF. At high magnification, individual clusters of presynaptic vesicles could be discerned, separated by regions of presynaptic membrane lacking vesicles, but apposed to continuous regions of postsynaptic density. Thus, after release, transmitter diffusion from the synaptic cleft must traverse considerable stretches of postsynaptic membrane before escape into extracellular space. In contrast, MF-granule cell synapses in these cerebellar regions resembled glutamate synapses in other brain regions in that the total synaptic area measured less than or equal to 4 mu m(2). These synaptic junctions were flanked by short stretches of unspecialized plasma membrane, providing a short (0.5 mu m) diffusional path from the site of neurotransmitter release to a branch point of the extracellular space.; 4. The MF-evoked EPSC in UBCs was composed of a fast (10-90% rise time: 0.70 ms) and slow (10-90% rise time: 395 ms; 10-90% decay time: 3.1 s) component. The fast component was blocked by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropopionic acidkainate (AMPAKA) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 mu M) and displayed linear current-voltage (I-V) relations in the presence or absence of external magnesium.; 5. The slow EPSC was also mediated by glutamate receptors, but in most neurons both AMPAKA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contributed to the slow EPSC, with the contribution of NMDA receptors predominating in the majority of cells. Consequently, although all cells displayed linear I-V relations in Mg2+ -free saline, cells in which the slow EPSC was predominently mediated by NMDA receptors exhibited voltage-dependent rectification in the presence of external Mg2+ (1 mM).; 6. With increasing postnatal age (10-30 d), the contribution made to the slow EPSC by NMDA receptors declined, with a reciprocal increase in the contribution being made by AMPAKA receptors.; 7. The bath application of cyclothiazide (20-80 mu M), which blocks AMPA receptor desensitization, greatly enhanced the amplitude of the non-NMDA receptor-mediated component and smoothed the decay of the EPSC from its initial peak, indicating that desensitization sculpts both the time course and the absolute amplitude of the non-NMDA receptor-mediated component. 8. Both the fast and slow components of the MF-evoked EPSC were elicited in an all-or-none fashion at the same stimulus threshold, supporting anatomic data that UBCs receive innervation from single MFs.; 9. In UBCs in which the axon was filled by Lucifer yellow, three-dimensional reconstructions of the cell using a laser-scanning confocal microscope revealed a branching axon of variable diameter that wandered within the granular layer without obvious orientation with respect to the plane of the folia and gave rise to two to four rosettelike terminals of large diameter (4-8 mu m).; 10. Current-damp recordings of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked in UBCs by MF stimulation revealed an initial fast EPSP followed by a slow EPSP with a prolonged train of action potentials (0.5-2 s). With repetitive stimulation (1-10 Hz), the slow EPSPs summated to produce a depolarizing plateau for the duration of the stimulus train.; 11. It is proposed that the prolonged time course of the slow EPSC results from an ultrastructural specialization at this giant glutamatergic synapse to entrap glutamate within the synaptic cleft after release. This results in a long-lasting synaptic potential that will produce a prolonged train of action potentials. Because UBCs are presumed to be glutamatergic, activation of the MFs innervating UBCs will result in a powerful feedforward excitation of target neurons within the granular layer. These neurons represent an important contribution to the basic cerebellar circuit in the vestibular regions of cerebellum where they are found in the highest density.

N2  -  Introduction: Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) has been described as early exhaustion with tiredness that develops during physical or mental activity and generally does not improve with rest. There are inconsistent findings on the relationship between the characteristics of the ischemic brain lesion and PSF. However, some studies suggest that specific neuroanatomical and neuroplastic changes could explain post-stroke fatigue. The aim was to evaluate the severity of PSF in relation to the location and the size of the ischemic lesion in acute stroke patients to establish possible predictors of PSF. Patients and methods: We performed a prospective observational study to establish potential early predictors of long-term PSF, which was assessed using the Fatigue Assessment Scale six months after ischemic stroke. After segmenting brain infarcts on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) images, we studied the association with PSF using Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping (VLSM). Results: Out of 104 patients, 61 (59 %) reported PSF. Female sex and history of diabetes mellitus were associated with a greater risk of developing PSF. The association of PSF with female sex was confirmed in a replication cohort of 50 patients. The ischemic lesion volume was not associated with PSF, and VBLSM analysis did not identify any specific brain area significantly associated with PSF. Conclusions: PSF is frequent in stroke patients, especially women, even after six months. The absence of neuroanatomical correlates of PSF suggests that it is a multifactorial process with biological, psychological, and social risk factors that require further study.

N2  -  To evaluate whether the cerebral blood volume (CBV) measurement with leakage correction from dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion weighted imaging can be useful in predicting prognosis for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). 46 PCNSL patients were included and classified by radiation therapy (RT) stratification into RT (n = 30) and non-RT (n = 16) groups. The corresponding histogram parameters of normalized CBV (nCBV) maps with or without leakage correction were calculated on contrast-enhanced T1 weighted image (CE T1WI) or on fluid attenuated inversion recovery image. The 75th percentile nCBV with leakage correction based on CE T1WI (T1 nCBVL(75%)) had a significant difference between the short and long progression free survival (PFS) subgroups of the RT group and the non-RT group, respectively. Based on the survival analysis, patients in the RT group with high T1 nCBVL(75%) had earlier progression than the others with a low T1 nCBVL(75%). However, patients in the non-RT group with a high T1 nCBVL(75%) had slower progression than the others with a low T1 nCBVL(75%). Based on RT stratification, the CBV with leakage correction has potential as a noninvasive biomarker for the prognosis prediction of PCNSL to identify high risk patients and it has a different correlation with the PFS based on the presence of combined RT.

N2  -  Stroke patients with "pusher syndrome" show severe misperception of their own upright body orientation although visual-vestibular processing is almost intact. This dissociation argues for a second graviceptive system in humans for the perception of body orientation. Recent studies revealed that the posterior thalamus is an important part of this system. The present investigation aimed to study the cortical representation of this system beyond the thalamus. We evaluated 45 acute patients with and without contraversive pushing following left- or right-sided cortical lesions sparing the thalamus. in both hemispheres, the simple lesion overlap associated with contraversive pushing typically centered on the insular cortex and parts of the postcentral gyrus. The comparison between pusher patients and controls who were matched with respect to age, lesion size, and the frequency of spatial neglect, aphasia and visual field defects revealed only very small regions that were specific for the pusher patients with cortical damage sparing the thalamus. Obviously, the cortical structures representing our control of upright body orientation are in close anatomical proximity to those areas that induce aphasia in the left hemisphere and spatial neglect in the right hemisphere when lesioned. We conclude that in addition to the subcortical area previously identified in the posterior thalamus, parts of the insula and postcentral gyrus appear to contribute at cortical level to the processing of the afferent signals mediating the graviceptive information about upright body orientation.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a noninvasive method for preoperatively localizing functional areas in patients with tumors in presumed motor eloquent areas. The aim of this study was to establish an nTMS-based risk stratification model by examining whether the results of nTMS mapping and its neurophysiological data predict postoperative motor outcome in glioma surgery.
METHODS Included in this study were prospectively collected data for 113 patients undergoing bihemispheric nTMS examination prior to surgery for gliomas in presumed motor eloquent locations. Multiple ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to test for any association between preoperative nTMS-related variables and postoperative motor outcome.; RESULTS A new motor deficit or deterioration due to a preexisting deficit was observed in 20% of cases after 7 days and in 22% after 3 months. In terms of tumor location, no new permanent deficit was observed when the distance between tumor and corticospinal tract was greater than 8 mm and the precentral gyrus was not infiltrated (p = 0.014). New postoperative deficits on Day 7 were associated with a pathological excitability of the motor cortices (interhemispheric resting motor threshold RMT ratio < 90% or > 110%, p = 0.031). Interestingly, motor function never improved when the RMT was significantly higher in the tumorous hemisphere than in the healthy hemisphere (RMT ratio > 110%).; CONCLUSIONS The proposed risk stratification model, based on objective functional-anatomical and neurophysiological measures, enables one to counsel patients about the risk of functional deterioration or the potential for recovery.

N2  -  Objective: To identify the fibers originating from the dorsal premotor cortex (dorsal PMC) that contribute to motor-evoked potentials (MEP), we have applied integrated functional neuronavigation and awake surgery during removal of an epileptic cortical dysplasia located in the right premotor cortex.
Methods: Chronic subdural electrodes were employed for functional mapping during a routine invasive evaluation for intractable epilepsy. After the fibers originating from the dorsal PMC were plotted into the tractography-integrated functional neuronavigation, subcortical MEPs and clinical symptoms were examined during resection of the epileptogenic dorsal PMC.; Results: During removal of the epileptogenic area, MEPs were elicited by electrical stimulation of the fibers originating from the dorsal PMC, which were separated from the pyramidal tracts from the precentral gyrus. Resection of the dorsal PMC and its fibers caused a transient dysmetric movement of the left toe without motor weakness.; Conclusion: Functional corticospinal tract fibers originating from the dorsal PMC can be defined and removed safely under local anesthesia with the aid of integration of functional neuronavigation and subcortical electrical stimulation.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To report a technique for endoscopic cystoventriculostomy guided by preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and tractography in a patient with a large speech eloquent arachnoid cyst.
METHODS: A 74-year old woman presented with a seizure and subsequent persistent anomic aphasia from a progressive left-sided parietal arachnoid cyst. An endoscopic cystoventriculostomy and endoscope-assisted ventricle catheter placement were performed. Surgery was guided by preoperative nTMS and tractography to avoid eloquent language, motor, and visual pathways.; RESULTS: Preoperative nTMS motor and language mapping were used to guide tractography of motor and language white matter tracts. The ideal locations of entry point and cystoventriculostomy as well as trajectory for stent-placement were determined preoperatively with a pseudo-3-dimensional model visualizing eloquent language, motor, and visual cortical and subcortical information. The early postoperative course was uneventful. At her 3-month follow-up visit, her language impairments had completely recovered. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated complete collapse of the arachnoid cyst.; CONCLUSION: The combination of nTMS and tractography supports the identification of a safe trajectory for cystoventriculostomy in eloquent arachnoid cysts.

N2  -  The activity of frontal motor areas during hand-object interaction is coordinated by dense communication along specific white matter pathways. This architecture allows the continuous shaping of voluntary motor output but, despite extensive investigation in non-human primate studies, remains poorly understood in humans. Disclosure of this system is crucial for predicting and treatment of motor deficits after brain lesions. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of direct electrical stimulation on white matter pathways within the frontal lobe on hand-object manipulation. This was tested in 34 patients (15 left hemisphere, mean age 42 years, 17 male, 15 with tractography) undergoing awake neurosurgery for frontal lobe tumour removal with the aid of the brain mapping technique. The stimulation outcome was quantified based on hand-muscle activity required by task execution. The white matter pathways responsive to stimulation with an interference on muscles were identified by means of probabilistic density estimation of stimulated sites, tract-based lesion-symptom (disconnectome) analysis and diffusion tractography on the single patient level. Finally, we assessed the effect of permanent tract disconnection on motor outcome in the immediate postoperative period using a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping approach. The analysis showed that stimulation disrupted hand-muscle activity during task execution at 66 sites within the white matter below dorsal and ventral premotor regions. Two different EMG interference patterns associated with different structural architectures emerged: (i) an 'arrest' pattern, characterized by complete impairment of muscle activity associated with an abrupt task interruption, occurred when stimulating a white matter area below the dorsal premotor region. Local middle U-shaped fibres, superior fronto-striatal, corticospinal and dorsal fronto-parietal fibres intersected with this region. (ii) a 'clumsy' pattern, characterized by partial disruption of muscle activity associated with movement slowdown and/or uncoordinated finger movements, occurred when stimulating a white matter area below the ventral premotor region. Ventral fronto-parietal and inferior fronto-striatal tracts intersected with this region. Finally, only resections partially including the dorsal white matter region surrounding the supplementary motor area were associated with transient upper-limb deficit (P = 0.05; 5000 permutations). Overall, the results identify two distinct frontal white matter regions possibly mediating different aspects of hand-object interaction via distinct sets of structural connectivity. We suggest the dorsal region, associated with arrest pattern and postoperative immediate motor deficits, to be functionally proximal to motor output implementation, while the ventral region may be involved in sensorimotor integration required for task execution.

N2  -  The radiologic modality that most likely provides the imaging information needed in a patient suspected of having a brain tumor is MR imaging. A brain tumor can be reliably ruled out if the MR examination is performed properly and experts interpret the results as negative. If there is a tumor, however, its exact location and topography must be determined. Important for therapy and prognosis are also tumor properties such as histologic type and grade, as well as effects on adjacent brain structures. Although potentially a noninvasive method of in vivo neuropathology, MR is still far from being sufficiently specific, as dissimilar lesions may look the same despite the use of refined imaging protocols. The evolution of MR improvement likely. Presently, advanced methods, such as diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR Imaging, functional MR imaging, neuronavigation based on MR imaging data, and the use of MR imaging during surgery (intraoperative MR imaging), influence the way patients are treated. Likewise, follow-up imaging (monitoring) of tumor patients by MR has become more effective, and experience has shown how to distinguish reactive changes from recurrent tumor. In the future, MR imaging may gain importance in the development of novel therapeutic concepts.

N2  -  A 51-year-old woman presented with 2 years of progressive left facial pain and numbness in maxillary nerve and mandibular nerve distributions. Symptoms were refractory to increasing doses of carbamazepine and gabapentin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a left cerebellopontine angle nonenhancing mass, with diffusion restriction causing trigeminal nerve compression. Fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition sequences revealed a superior cerebellar artery loop in the angle between cranial nerve V and pons. The patient agreed to resection of the mass and microvascular decompression. Retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed with sensory/motor, and facial-auditory nerves' monitoring. The mass was densely adherent to cranial nerves VIIeX and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, causing compression at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve. It was carefully dissected off these structures; pathology confirmed an epidermoid. A large bony tubercle obscured visualization; therefore, a 30 & nbsp; endoscope was used. The tubercle was drilled, and remnant portions of the mass were removed. During mobilization of the superior cerebellar artery loop, it was found to be duplicated, and polytef (Teflon) pledgets were placed for microvascular decompression. The trigeminal nerve was thus discovered intraoperatively to be trapped simultaneously between the duplicated superior cerebellar artery loop from above and the epidermoid from below. Pain relief was immediate; at 12-month follow-up, the patient was pain-free, she had minimal numbness around the angle of the lip, and medications were discontinued. Facial nerve function and hearing were intact. A pure endoscopic approach is minimally invasive with a smaller incision and has been described for microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. Cerebrospinal fluid leak rates are expected to be lower. This technique has a steep learning curve and could pose a significant challenge for resection of lesions densely adherent to neurovascular structures. A pure microscopic approach generally involves a larger incision and can be better suited for resection of cerebellopontine angle lesions where bimanual dissection would be necessary. Visualization around corners in the presence of large bony protuberances (e.g., large suprameatal tubercle) around vessels and nerves in the depths is a drawback. Combining microscopic surgery with endoscopic assistance (especially angled endoscope) negates the disadvantages of either method alone, allowing for visualization around structures in the depths of the cerebellopontine angle where microscope lighting may be reduced, and provides a means to achieve gross total resection of tumor hidden from view.

N2  -  Countless therapeutic strategies have been explored over many decades to prevent or slow the progression of glioblastoma. Despite radical changes in radiation management in other malignancies, there have been no major advances in the radiotherapeutic approach to glioblastoma in over 30 years. Past hopes to overcome inherent radioresistance with escalating doses have been met with frustration. However, prior clinical trials were performed before temozolomide, a radiosensitizer, altered the standard of care and this has renewed interest in dose escalation. Immunotherapy has led to further excitement, given the substantial responses that have been observed in other cancers when combined with high-dose radiation. In addition, advances in molecular profiling and neuroimaging have created new opportunities to improve patient selection for the most appropriate course of treatment. In this review, we outline past attempts to utilize radiosurgery in glioblastoma and focus on the potential to reintroduce this modality of dose escalation in the setting of modern and emerging systemic agents, molecular studies and imaging analyses.

N2  -  Cystic lesions and abscesses of the neck contain fluids that vary in viscosity and content. The purpose of this study was to characterize the fluid areas in cystic and abscess lesions using apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs).
Lesion-based ADCs (overall ADCs) and pixel-based ADCs (ADC mapping) of the fluid areas in cystic lesions (n = 25) and abscesses (n = 17) were determined using b values of 500 and 1000 smm(2). The fluid areas were defined as hyperintense areas on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images andor non-enhanced images.; Cystic lesions and abscesses were categorized into two groups on the basis of the overall ADCs of the fluid areas: group A included ranulas, lymphangiomas, parotid cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, and mucous retention cysts (2.38 x 10(-3) +- A 0.26 x 10(-3) mm(2)s; range 1.97 x 10(-3)-2.93 x 10(-3) mm(2)s), whereas group B included epidermoid cysts, branchial cleft cysts, and abscesses (0.73 x 10(-3) +- A 0.37 x 10(-3) mm(2)s; range 0.36 x 10(-3)-1.53 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). The group A cystic lesions displayed ADC mapping profiles with 85-100% areas of high or intermediate ADCs (> 1.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). In contrast, the group B lesions exhibited ADC mapping profiles with 86-100% areas of low or extremely low ADCs (< 1.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). Combined use of the ADCs and ADC mapping criteria effectively (85-100% accuracy) discriminated the different types of cystic lesions and abscesses in the present study cohort.; The fluid areas in cystic and abscess lesions of the neck can be characterized by ADCs.

N2  -  Study objective: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) measures deficits caused by a stroke, but not all stroke signs are captured on the NIHSS. We determine the symptoms and stroke localization of patients with brain infarction and an NIHSS score of 0.
Methods: We studied all patients who presented with acute neurologic symptoms to our stroke center from 2004 to 2008 and had persistent symptoms at the evaluation in the emergency department, an NIHSS score of 0, and an infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging. We characterized the symptoms, signs, lesion location, demographics, and stroke causes.; Results: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. Symptoms frequently experienced were headache, vertigo, and nausea. The posterior circulation was commonly infarcted in this group. Truncal ataxia was the most common neurologic sign.; Conclusion: Ischemic stroke may cause symptoms that are associated with no deficits on the NIHSS score. Ann Emerg Med. 2011;57:42-45.

N2  -  The claustrum seems to have been waiting for the science of connectomics. Due to its tiny size, the structure has remained remarkably difficult to study until modern technological and mathematical advancements like graph theory, connectomics, diffusion tensor imaging, HARDI, and excitotoxic lesioning. That does not mean, however, that early methods allowed researchers to assess micro-connectomics. In fact, the claustrum is such an enigma that the only things known for certain about it are its histology, and that it is extraordinarily well connected. In this literature review, we provide background details on the claustrum and the history of its study in the human and in other animal species. By providing an explanation of the neuroimaging and histology methods have been undertaken to study the claustrum thus far-and the conclusions these studies have drawn-we illustrate this example of how the shift from micro-connectomics to macro-connectomics advances the field of neuroscience and improves our capacity to understand the brain.

N2  -  To explore the role of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MRI maps based on entire tumor volume data in determining pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNT) grade.
Retrospective evaluation of 22 patients with PNTs included low-grade (G1; n = 15), intermediate-grade (G2; n = 4), and high-grade (G3; n = 3) tumors. Regions of interest containing the lesion were drawn on every section of the ADC map containing the tumor and summated to obtain histograms for entire tumor volume. Calculated histographic parameters included mean ADC (mADC), 5th percentile ADC, 10th percentile ADC, 25th percentile ADC, 50th percentile ADC, 75th percentile ADC (ADC75), 90th percentile ADC (ADC90) and 95th percentile ADC (ADC95), skewness and kurtosis. Histogram parameters were correlated with tumor grade by repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc comparisons.; The mADC, ADC75, ADC90, and ADC95 were significantly higher in G1 tumors (1283 +- A 267; 1404 +- A 300; 1495 +- A 318; 1562 +- A 347 x 10(-6) mm(2)s) compared to G2 (892 +- A 390; 952 +- A 381; 1036 +- A 384; 1072 +- A 374 x 10(-6) mm(2)s) and to G3 tumors (733 +- A 225; 864 +- A 284; 1008 +- A 288; 1152 +- A 192 x 10(-6) mm(2)s) (p value < 0.05). Skewness and kurtosis were significantly different between G1 (0.041 +- A 0.466; 2.802 +- A 0.679) and G3 (1.01 +- A 1.140; 5.963 +- A 4.008) tumors (p value < 0.05). Tumor volume (mL) was significantly higher on G3 (55 +- A 15.7) compared to G1 (1.9 +- A 2.7) and G2 (4.5 +- A 3.6) tumors (p value < 0.05). In this small sample size, we did not detect statistically significant parameters between G2 (n = 4) and G3 (n = 3) tumors.; Histographic analysis of ADC maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume can be useful in differentiating histologic grades of PNTs.

N2  -  Background and Study Aims Minimally invasive approaches to deep-seated lesions still represent a fundamental issue in modern neurosurgery. Tubular retractors allow to enhance the operability of intraventricular lesions, minimizing the risk of damages to brain parenchyma. Increasing interest for portal devices has been mainly focused on supratentorial pathologies, while transportal approaches in the posterior cranial fossa have been rarely described. In the present study, the authors aimed to investigate the surgical exposure and operability obtained with a microsurgical neuroportal transcerebellar approach targeting the fourth ventricle, assisted by endoscopic exploration.
Material and Methods Six cadaveric specimens were provided for anatomical microsurgical dissection and Vycor ViewSite Brain Access System was used as tubular retractor. Surgical feasibility of the neuroportal transcerebellar approach was demonstrated through a definable and measurable parameter, the operability score.; Results The neuroport provided a surgical corridor away from eloquent structures to target the whole fourth ventricle cavity, preventing injury to cerebellar nuclei and white matter pathways and, potentially, minimizing the risk of surgical morbidity. Maximal operability was reached in the pontomedullary junction and medullary area of the ventricular floor. Transportal endoscopic assistance contributed to a further extension of surgical exposure in blind spots, corresponding to the ipsilateral lateral recess, the uppermost part of the fourth ventricle, and the obex.; Conclusion The neuroportal transcerebellar approach represents a viable alternative route to the fourth ventricle, avoiding vermian splitting or subarachnoid dissection of the cerebellomedullary cistern. Endoscopic assistance enhances the exposure of the surgical field and accomplishes a valid instrument for intraventricular orientation to ease microsurgical procedures.

N2  -  We aimed to determine if volumetric mismatch between tissue at risk and tissue destined to infarct on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) can be described by the mismatch of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS).
Forty patients with nonlacunar middle cerebral artery infarct < 6 h old who had CTP on admission were retrospectively reviewed. Two raters segmented the lesion volume on mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps using thresholds of > 6 s and < 2.0 mL per 100 g, respectively. Two other raters assigned ASPECTS to the same MTT and CBV maps while blinded to the volumetric data. Volumetric mismatch was deemed present if a parts per thousand yen20%. ASPECTS mismatch (=CBV ASPECTS -aEuro parts per thousand MTT ASPECTS) was deemed present if a parts per thousand yen1. Correlation between the two types of mismatches was assessed by Spearman's coefficient (rho). ROC curve analyses were performed to determine the optimal ASPECTS mismatch cut point for volumetric mismatch a parts per thousand yen20%, a parts per thousand yen50%, a parts per thousand yen100%, and a parts per thousand yen150%.; Median volumetric mismatch was 130% (range 10.9-2,031%) with 31 (77.5%) being a parts per thousand yen20%. Median ASPECTS mismatch was 2 (range 0-6) with 26 (65%) being a parts per thousand yen1. ASPECTS mismatch correlated strongly with volumetric mismatch with rho = 0.763 95% CI 0.585-0.870, p < 0.0001. Sensitivity and specificity for volumetric mismatch a parts per thousand yen20% was 83.9% 95% CI 65.5-93.5 and 100% 95% CI 65.9-100, respectively, using ASPECTS mismatch a parts per thousand yen1. Volumetric mismatch a parts per thousand yen50%, a parts per thousand yen100%, and a parts per thousand yen150% were optimally identified using ASPECTS mismatch a parts per thousand yen1, a parts per thousand yen2, and a parts per thousand yen2, respectively.; On CTP, ASPECTS mismatch showed strong correlation to volumetric mismatch. ASPECTS mismatch a parts per thousand yen1 was the optimal cut point for volumetric mismatch a parts per thousand yen20%.

N2  -  -OBJECTIVE: Surgery of eloquent area gliomas is chal-lenging and requires monitoring of the nearby white fiber tracts. In the present study, we analyzed 102 patients with eloquent region gliomas and discussed the concept of intraoperative dynamic white fiber tract navigation and monitoring.METHODS: A total of 102 patients with an eloquent area glioma (52 insular, 29 motor area, 21 temporoparietal) were evaluated. The position of the white fiber tracts (cortico-spinal tract [or motor fiber; CST], inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus [ventral language fiber; IFOF], superior longitu-dinal fasciculus [SLF], and arcuate fasciculus [dorsal lan-guage fiber; AF) was recorded. Awake mapping of the cortical and subcortical eloquent structures was per-formed for all 102 patients. The suction stimulator was coregistered and used as a dynamic stimulator navigator.RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 60 were men and 42 were women, with an average age of 39.8 years. Most of the white fiber tracts were normal (CST, 31.3%; IFOF, 39.2%; SLF/AF, 40.19%) or displaced (CST, 59.8%; IFOF, 47.05%; AF/ SLF, 44.11%). A few were disrupted (CST, 8.8%; IFOF, 13.7%; SLF/AF, 15.7%). The extent of tumor resection was 82.8%, 86.5%, and 94% for those with insular glioma, motor area glioma, and temporoparietal glioma, respectively. Of the 102 patients, 18 had developed transient speech and language disturbances with improvement, and 14 had developed motor deficits, of whom, all except for 2, had shown gradual improvement. When the dynamic suction stimulator navigator was used, the extent of resection was 96.5%, without any added deficits.CONCLUSIONS: The use of intraoperative neuro-navigation and neurophysiological assessment can help achieve maximal tumor resection of eloquent area gliomas. Use of the integrated suction stimulator navigator provided dynamic navigation and mapping of the peritumoral eloquent fibers.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) can improve walking ability after stroke but the underlying mechanisms are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the changes in the injured brain after RAGT and compared the effects of early start and late start of RAGT.; METHODS: Eleven patients with hemiplegia after stroke undergoing inpatient rehabilitation were examined within 3 months of stroke onset and were randomly assigned into two groups. Group 1 started RAGT with conventional physiotherapy immediately after enrollment, whereas Group 2 underwent conventional physiotherapy for 4 weeks before starting RAGT. We acquired diffusion tensor imaging data after enrollment and at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were used to analyze the neural changes.; RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance of the data at 4 weeks after treatment showed a significant interaction between time and groups (RAGT versus control) for the FA and MD values in the non-lesioned hemisphere, indicating that the non-lesioned hemisphere was significantly reorganized by RAGT compared with conventional physiotherapy. Analysis of the data at 8 weeks after treatment showed a significant interaction between time and groups (early and late start of RAGT) for the MD values in the motor-related areas bilaterally, indicating that early start of RAGT significantly accelerated bi-hemispheric reorganization as compared with late start of RAGT.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that RAGT can facilitate reorganization in the intact superior temporal, cingulate, and postcentral gyri. Furthermore, early start of RAGT can accelerate bi-hemispheric reorganization in the motor-related brain regions.

N2  -  Introduction. An increasing number of multimodal images represent a valuable increase in available image information, but at the same time it complicates the extraction of diagnostic information across the images. Multispectral analysis (MSA) has the potential to simplify this problem substantially as unlimited number of images can be combined, and tissue properties across the images can be extracted automatically. Materials and methods. We have developed a software solution for MSA containing two algorithms for unsupervised classification, an EM-algorithm finding multinormal class descriptions and the k-means clustering algorithm, and two for supervised classification, a Bayesian classifier using multinormal class descriptions and a kNN-algorithm. The software has an efficient user interface for the creation and manipulation of class descriptions, and it has proper tools for displaying the results. Results. The software has been tested on different sets of images. One application is to segment cross-sectional images of brain tissue (T1- and T2-weighted MR images) into its main normal tissues and brain tumors. Another interesting set of images are the perfusion maps and diffusion maps, derived images from raw MR images. The software returns segmentations that seem to be sensible. Discussion. The MSA software appears to be a valuable tool for image analysis with multimodal images at hand. It readily gives a segmentation of image volumes that visually seems to be sensible. However, to really learn how to use MSA, it will be necessary to gain more insight into what tissues the different segments contain, and the upcoming work will therefore be focused on examining the tissues through for example histological sections.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subdural empyema (SDE), an infection of the subdural space, occurs most often in pediatric patients as a complication of meningitis, sinusitis, or otitis media. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been used in the past to investigate intracerebral infections. The purpose of this study was to determine the signal intensity characteristics of SDE on DWIs as well as the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.
METHODS: MR studies of 10 patients with SDEs were retrospectively reviewed. Included were routine sequences and DWI, which consisted of an axial single-shot echo-planar spin-echo sequence (TRTE, 4000110) with b values of 0, 500, and 1000 smm(2). Signal-intensity characteristics on routine MR images and DWIs were evaluated. In seven patients, ADC values of the lesions were calculated by using two b values. Follow-up imaging study was performed in seven patients.; RESULTS: In nine patients, the empyema was hyperintense on DWIs. In the remaining patient, the empyema showed mixed hyperintensity and hypointensity. ADC values were lower than those of normal cortical gray matter and much lower than those of reactive subdural effusions. In all seven patients with persistent clinical signs of infection, the empyemas were hyperintense on follow-up DWIs.; CONCLUSION: SDE had high signal intensity on DWIs and low signal intensity on ADC maps, with an ADC value lower than that of the normal cortical gray matter. Diffusion MR imaging can be valuable in distinguishing SDE from effusion and in the follow-up of subdural collections.

N2  -  Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent and aggressive type of primary brain tumor. Recurrences are mostly located at the margin of the resection cavity in the peritumoral brain zone (PBZ). Although it is widely believed that infiltrative tumor cells in this zone are responsible for GB recurrence, few studies have examined this zone. In this study, we analyzed PBZ left after surgery with a variety of techniques including radiology, histopathology, flow cytometry, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and primary cell cultures. The resulting PBZ profiles were compared with those of the GB tumor zone and normal brain samples to identify characteristics specific to the PBZ. We found that tumor cell infiltration detected by standard histological analysis was present in almost one third of PBZ taken from an area that was considered normal both on standard MRI and by the neurosurgeon under an operating microscope. The panel of techniques used in this study show that the PBZ, similar to the tumor zone itself, is characterized by substantial inter-patient heterogeneity, which makes it difficult to identify representative markers. Nevertheless, we identified specific alterations in the PBZ such as the presence of selected tumor clones and stromal cells with tumorigenic and angiogenic properties. The study of GB-PBZ is a growing field of interest and this region needs to be characterized further. This will facilitate the development of new, targeted therapies for patients with GB and the development of approaches to refine the per-operative evaluation of the PBZ to optimize the surgical resection of the tumor.

N2  -  Objective: To establish the validity of visual interpretation of immediately processed perfusion computed tomography (CT) maps in acute stroke for prediction of final infarction.
Methods: Perfusion CT studies acquired prospectively were reprocessed within six hours of stroke onset using standard CT console software. Four contiguous 5 mm thick images were obtained and maps of time to peak (TTP) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) generated. Volumes of lesions identified only by visual inspection were measured from manually drawn regions of interest. Volumes of tissue with prolonged TTP or reduced CBV were compared with independently calculated volume of infarction on non-contrast CT (NCCT) at 24-48 hours, and with clinical severity using the NIHSS score. Arterial patency at 24-48 h was included in analyses.; Results: Studies were analysed from 17 patients 150 minutes (median) after stroke onset. Volume of tissue with prolonged TTP correlated with initial NIHSS (r = 0.62, p = 0.009), and with NCCT final infarct volume when arterial occlusion persisted (r = 0.953, p = 0.012). Volume of tissue with reduced CBV correlated with final infarct volume if recanalisation occurred (r = 0.835, p = 0.001). Recanalisation was associated with lower 24 h NIHSS score (6 (IQR, 5 to 9.5) v 19 (18 to 26), p = 0.027), and in 10 patients given rtPA for MCA M1 occlusion, with lower infarct volume (73 v 431 ml, p = 0.002).; Conclusions: Visual evaluation of TTP and CBV maps generated by standard perfusion CT software correlated with 24-48 hour CT infarct volumes. Comparison of TTP and CBV maps yields information on tissue viability. Perfusion CT represents a practical technique to aid acute clinical decision making. Recanalisation was a crucial determinant of clinical and radiological outcome.

N2  -  Introduction: Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is a constellation of temporary symptoms that may occur following tumors of the frontal lobe. Affected patients develop akinesia and mutism but often recover within weeks to months. With our own case examples and with correlations to fiber tracking validated by gross anatomical dissection as ground truth, we describe a white matter pathway through which recovery may occur.
Methods: Diffusion spectrum imaging from the Human Connectome Project was used for tractography analysis. SMA outflow tracts were mapped in both hemispheres using a predefined seeding region. Postmortem dissections of 10 cadaveric brains were performed using a modified Klingler technique to verify the tractography results.; Results: Two cases were identified in our clinical records in which patients sustained permanent SMA syndrome after complete disconnection of the SMA and corpus callosum (CC). After investigating the postoperative anatomy of these resections, we identified a pattern of nonhomologous connections through the CC connecting the premotor area to the contralateral premotor and SMAs. The transcallosal fibers have projections from the previously described frontal aslant tract (FAT) and thus, we have termed this path the "crossed FAT."; Conclusions: We hypothesize that this newly described tract may facilitate recovery from SMA syndrome by maintaining interhemispheric connectivity through the supplementary motor and premotor areas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differentiation between classic and atypical meningiomas may have implications in preoperative planning but may not be possible on the basis of conventional MR imaging. Our hypothesis was that classic and atypical meningiomas have different patterns of intratumoral water diffusion that will allow for differentiation between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in 12 classic and 12 atypical meningiomas. Signal intensity of solid-enhancing tumor regions on diffusion-weighted trace images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps was assessed. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in solid-enhancing regions, peritumoral edema, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to measure tensor metrics including major (lambda(1)), intermediate (lambda(2)) and minor eigenvalues (lambda(3)) and FA and ADC values. Distribution of tenser shapes within enhancing tumors was calculated for all tumors. Differences between classic and atypical meningiomas in tumor signal intensity, intratumoral and peritumoral tenser metrics, as well as tenser shapes distribution were statistically analyzed.; RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of atypical meningiomas were isointense and hypointense on ADC maps (P = .007). Classic meningiomas had significantly lower FA (P = .012), higher ADC (P = .011), greater lambda(2) (P = .020) and lambda(3) (P = .003). There was significantly more spherical diffusion in classic than in atypical meningiomas (P = .020). All diffusion tenser metrics for peritumoral edema of the 2 tumor groups did not differ.; CONCLUSION: DTI showed that intratumoral microscopic water motion is less organized in classic than in atypical meningiomas. This feature may allow for noninvasive differentiation between classic and atypical meningiomas.

N2  -  Background: A major concern of occipital lobe surgery is the risk of visual field deficits. Extending anatomical occipital lobectomy to the functional requires awake conditions because the anterior resection border comprises language-, motor-and visuospatial function-related areas within the temporal and parietal lobes. This study investigated the lateral and posterior perspectives of the occipital lobe anatomy when approaching intraaxial occipital lobe lesions.Materials and methods: Ten adult cadaveric cerebral hemispheres were dissected after being prepared following the concept described by Klingler for the first time.Results: The occipital lobe was located posteriorly to the parietotemporal line. Within the occipital lobe, the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle represented the only anatomical landmark. Laterally, optic radiation was identified as a part of the sagittal stratum. None of the intraoperatively identifiable tracts was found medial to the occipital horn. Language-and motor-related areas were identified anteriorly and should be actively identified when lobectomy based on function is planned. Subcortically, from a posterior perspective, the anterolateral border constituted the arcuate fascicle/superior longitudinal fascicle complex and was anteromedial to the thalamocortical tract. Remaining posterior to the line connect- ing the preoccipital notch with the superior Rolandic point avoided the cortical and white matter tracts related to language, motor and visuospatial function.Conclusions: Knowledge of occipital lobe anatomy and surrounding structures is essential to preoperatively assess the risk of the procedure and proper consultation of a patient in terms of the extent of resection, primarily concerning visual field deficits.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to characterise the white matter damage involved in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the relationship between this damage and clinical presentation. Twenty patients with INPH, 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (as disease control groups) were enrolled in this study. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were determined using DTI, and these measures were analysed to compare the INPH group with the control groups and with certain clinical correlates. On average, the supratentorial white matter presented higher MD and lower FA in the INPH group than in the control groups. In the INPH group, the mean hemispheric FA correlated with some of the clinical measures, whereas the mean hemispheric MD did not. On a voxel-based statistical map, white matter involvement with high MD was localised to the periventricular regions, and white matter involvement with low FA was localised to the corpus callosum and the subcortical regions. The total scores on the Frontal Assessment Battery were correlated with the FA in the frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, and an index of gait disturbance was correlated with the FA in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule and under the left supplementary motor area. DTI revealed the presence of white matter involvement in INPH. Whereas white matter regions with high MD were not related to symptom manifestation, those with low FA were related to motor and cognitive dysfunction in INPH.

N2  -  Background Single-shot diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (ssDW-EPI) acquired with parallel imaging and a multi-oblique scan plane may suffer from residual aliasing artifacts, resembling lesions on the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Purpose To combine ssDW-EPI and virtual coil acquisition and develop a self-reference reconstruction method to eliminate the residual aliasing artifact on multi-oblique ssDW-EPI sequence with parallel imaging and multiple signal averaging. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Three healthy subjects and 50 stroke patients. Field Strength/Sequence Conventional ssDW-EPI with parallel imaging, and proposed ssDW-EPI with virtual coil acquisition at 1.5T. Assessment The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated in 50 stroke patients by comparing the ssDW-EPI with conventional parallel imaging reconstructions. The extent of residual aliasing artifacts were rated on a 5-point Likert scale by three independent raters. Only the data without residual aliasing artifacts on conventional ssDW-EPI were included for the assessment of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ghost-to-signal ratio (GSR), and ADC. Statistical Tests The interobserver agreements for examining residual aliasing artifacts were measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A two-sample t-test was performed for comparing SNR, GSR, and ADC. Results There was a perfect agreement (ICC = 1.00) in the examination of residual aliasing artifacts on images obtained using the proposed method. The incidence rates of the residual aliasing artifact on the ADC maps obtained from the scanner console and proposed method were 60% (ie, 30 out of 50) and 0%, respectively. The proposed method offers significantly lower GSR than conventional parallel imaging reconstruction (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in SNR (P = 0.20-0.51) and ADC values (P = 0.20-0.94) between conventional parallel imaging reconstructions and the proposed method. Data Conclusion It appears that our method could effectively eliminate artifacts and significantly improve the GSR of b = 0 T2WI and b > 0 DWI, as well as permit ADC measurement consistent with conventional techniques. Our method may be beneficial to clinical assessment of the brain that utilizes multi-oblique ssDW-EPI. Technical Efficacy Stage: 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019.

N2  -  First described for use in mapping the human visual cortex in 1991, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is based on blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in cortical regions that occur during specific tasks. Typically, an overabundance of oxygenated (arterial) blood is supplied during activation of brain areas. Consequently, the venous outflow from the activated areas contains a higher concentration of oxyhemoglobin, which changes the paramagnetic properties of the tissue that can be detected during a T2-star acquisition. fMRI data can be acquired in response to specific tasks or in the resting state. fMRI has been widely applied to studying physiologic and pathophysiologic diseases of the brain. This review will discuss the most common current clinical applications of fMRI as well as emerging directions.

N2  -  To characterize the anatomical connectivity of the prelemniscal radiations (Raprl), a white matter region within the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) that is an effective neurosurgical target for treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Diffusion-weighted images were acquired from twelve healthy subjects using a 3T scanner. Constrained spherical deconvolution, a method that allows the distinction of crossing fibers within a voxel, was used to compute track-density images with sufficient resolution to accurately delineate distinct PSA regions and probabilistic tractography of Raprl in both hemispheres. Raprl connectivity was reproducible across all subjects and showed fibers traversing through this region towards primary and supplementary motor cortices, the orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral thalamus, and the globus pallidus, cerebellum and dorsal brainstem. All brain regions reached by Raprl fibers are part of motor circuits involved in the pathophysiology of PD; while these fiber systems converge at the level of the PSA, they can be spatially segregated. Fibers of distinct and specific motor control networks are identified within Raprl. The description of this anatomical crossroad suggests that, in the future, tractography could allow deep brain stimulation or lesional therapies in white matter targets according to individual patient's symptoms.

N2  -  The frontal aslant tract (FAT) is a recently identified white matter tract connecting the supplementary motor complex and lateral superior frontal gyrus to the inferior frontal gyrus. Advancements in neuroimaging and refinements to anatomical dissection techniques of the human brain white matter contributed to the recent description of the FAT anatomical and functional connectivity and its role in the pathogenesis of several neurological, psychiatric, and neurosurgical disorders. Through the application of diffusion tractography and intraoperative electrical brain stimulation, the FAT was shown to have a role in speech and language functions (verbal fluency, initiation and inhibition of speech, sentence production, and lexical decision), working memory, visual-motor activities, orofacial movements, social community tasks, attention, and music processing. Microstructural alterations of the FAT have also been associated with neurological disorders, such as primary progressive aphasia, post-stroke aphasia, stuttering, Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome, social communication deficit in autism spectrum disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We provide a systematic review of the current literature about the FAT anatomical connectivity and functional roles. Specifically, the aim of the present study relies on providing an overview for practical neurosurgical applications for the pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative assessment of patients with brain tumors located around and within the FAT. Moreover, some useful tests are suggested for the neurosurgical evaluation of FAT integrity to plan a safer surgery and to reduce post-operative deficits.

N2  -  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a remarkably effective clinical tool, used primarily for movement disorders. DBS relies on precise targeting of specific brain regions to rebalance the oscillatory behaviour of whole-brain neural networks. Traditionally, DBS targeting has been based upon animal models (such as MPTP for Parkinson's disease) but has also been the result of serendipity during human lesional neurosurgery. There are, however, no good animal models of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, and progress in this area has been slow. In this paper, we use advanced tractography combined with whole-brain anatomical parcellation to provide a rational foundation for identifying the connectivity 'fingerprint' of existing, successful DBS targets. This knowledge can then be used pre-surgically and even potentially for the discovery of novel targets. First, using data from our recent case series of cingulate DBS for patients with treatment-resistant chronic pain, we demonstrate how to identify the structural 'fingerprints' of existing successful and unsuccessful DBS targets in terms of their connectivity to other brain regions, as defined by the whole-brain anatomical parcellation. Second, we use a number of different strategies to identify the successful fingerprints of structural connectivity across four patients with successful outcomes compared with two patients with unsuccessful outcomes. This fingerprinting method can potentially be used pre-surgically to account for a patient's individual connectivity and identify the best DBS target. Ultimately, our novel fingerprinting method could be combined with advanced whole-brain computational modelling of the spontaneous dynamics arising from the structural changes in disease, to provide new insights and potentially new targets for hitherto impenetrable neuropsychiatric disorders.

N2  -  Naming pictures and matching words to pictures belonging to the same semantic category negatively affects language production and comprehension. By most accounts, semantic interference arises when accessing lexical representations in naming (e.g., Damian, Vigliocco, & Levelt, 2001) and semantic representations in comprehension (e.g., Forde & Humphreys, 1997). Further, damage to the left inferior frontal gyms (LIFG), a region implicated in cognitive control, results in increasing semantic interference when items repeat across cycles in both language production and comprehension (Jefferies, Baker, Doran, & Lambon Ralph, 2007). This generates the prediction that the LIFG via white matter connections supports resolution of semantic interference arising from different loci (lexical vs semantic) in the temporal lobe. However, it remains unclear whether the cognitive and neural mechanisms that resolve semantic interference are the same across tasks. Thus, we examined which gray matter structures [using whole brain and region of interest (ROI) approaches] and white matter connections (using deterministic tractography) when damaged impact semantic interference and its increase across cycles when repeatedly producing and understanding words in 15 speakers with varying lexical-semantic deficits from left hemisphere stroke. We found that damage to distinct brain regions, the posterior versus anterior temporal lobe, was associated with semantic interference (collapsed across cycles) in naming and comprehension, respectively. Further, those with LIFG damage compared to those without exhibited marginally larger increases in semantic interference across cycles in naming but not comprehension. Lastly, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, connecting the LIFG with posterior temporal lobe, related to semantic interference in naming, whereas the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), connecting posterior with anterior temporal regions related to semantic interference in comprehension. These neuroanatomical-behavioral findings have implications for models of the lexical-semantic language network by demonstrating that semantic interference in language production and comprehension involves different representations which differentially recruit a cognitive control mechanism for interference resolution.

Quicktome was designed using machine-learning to generate robust visualization of important brain networks that can be used with standard neuronavigation to minimize those deficits. We sought to see whether Quicktome could help localize important cerebral networks and tracts during intracerebral surgery. - METHODS: We report on all patients who underwent keyhole intracranial surgery with available Quicktomeenabled neuronavigation. We retrospectively analyzed the locations of the lesions and determined functional networks at risks, including chief executive network, default mode network, salience, corticospinal/sensorimotor, language, neglect, and visual networks. We report on the postoperative neurologic outcomes of the patients and retrospectively determined whether the outcomes could be explained by Quicktome's functional localizations. -RESULTS: Fifteen high-risk patients underwent craniotomies for intra-axial tumors, with the exception of one meningioma and one case of leukoencephalopathy. Eight patients were male. The median age was 49.6 years. Quicktome was readily integrated in our existing navigation system in every case. New postoperative neurologic deficits occurred in 8 patients. All new deficits, except for one resulting from a postoperative stroke, were expected and could be explained by preoperative findings by Quicktome. In addition, in those who did not have new neurologic deficits, Quicktome offered explanations for their outcomes. -CONCLUSIONS: Quicktome helps to visualize complex functional connectomic networks and tracts by seamlessly integrating into existing neuronavigation platforms. The added information may assist in reducing neurological deficits and offer explanations for postsurgical outcomes.

N2  -  Lesion studies are an important tool for cognitive neuroscientists and neurologists. However, while brain lesion studies have traditionally aimed to localize neurological symptoms to specific anatomical loci, a growing body of evidence indicates that neurological diseases such as stroke are best conceptualized as brain network disorders. While researchers in the fields of neuroscience and neurology are therefore increasingly interested in quantifying the effects of focal brain lesions on the white matter connections that form the brain's structural connectome, few dedicated tools exist to facilitate this endeavor. Here, we present the Lesion Quantification Toolkit, a publicly available MATLAB software package for quantifying the structural impacts of focal brain lesions. The Lesion Quantification Toolkit uses atlas-based approaches to estimate parcel-level grey matter lesion loads and multiple measures of white matter disconnection severity that include tract-level disconnection measures, voxel-wise disconnection maps, and parcel-wise disconnection matrices. The toolkit also estimates lesion-induced increases in the lengths of the shortest structural paths between parcel pairs, which provide information about changes in higher-order structural network topology. We describe in detail each of the different measures produced by the toolkit, discuss their applications and considerations relevant to their use, and perform example analyses using real behavioral data collected from sub-acute stroke patients. We show that analyses performed using the different measures produced by the toolkit produce results that are highly consistent with results that have been reported in the prior literature, and we demonstrate the consistency of results obtained from analyses conducted using the different disconnection measures produced by the toolkit. We anticipate that the Lesion Quantification Toolkit will empower researchers to address research questions that would be difficult or impossible to address using traditional lesion analyses alone, and ultimately, lead to advances in our understanding of how white matter disconnections contribute to the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of focal brain lesions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGGs) represent several pathological entities that infiltrate and invade cortical and subcortical structures in the brain.
OBJECTIVE: To describe methods for rapid prototyping of DLGGs and surgically relevant anatomy.; METHODS: Using high-definition imaging data and rapid prototyping technologies, we were able to generate 3 patient DLGGs to scale and represent the associated whitematter tracts in 3 dimensions using advanced diffusion tensor imaging techniques.; RESULTS: This report represents a novel application of 3-dimensional (3-D) printing in neurosurgery and a means to model individualized tumors in 3-D space with respect to subcorticalwhite matter tract anatomy. Faculty and resident evaluations of this technology were favorable at our institution.; CONCLUSION: Developing an understanding of the anatomic relationships existing within individuals is fundamental to successful neurosurgical therapy. Imaging-based rapid prototyping may improve on our ability to plan for and treat complex neuro-oncologic pathology.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treats severe, medically refractory essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson disease. However, the optimal target for SRS treatment within the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) is not clearly defined. This work evaluates the precision of the physician-selected VIM target, and determines the optimal SRS target within the VIM by correlation between early responders and nonresponders. METHODS Early responders and nonresponders were assessed retrospectively by Elements Basal Ganglia Atlas autocontouring of the VIM on the pre???SRS-treatment 1-mm slice thickness T1-weighted MRI and correlating the center of the post???SRS-treatment lesion. Using pre-and posttreatment diffusion tensor imaging, the fiber tracking package in the Elements software generated tremor-related tracts from autosegmented motor cortex, thalamus, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus. Autocontouring of the VIM was successful for all patients. RESULTS Among 23 patients, physician-directed SRS targets had a medial???lateral target range from +2.5 mm to ???2.0 mm from the VIM center. Relative to the VIM center, the SRS isocenter target was 0.7???0.9 mm lateral for 6 early responders and 0.9???1.1 mm medial for 4 nonresponders (p = 0.019), and without differences in the other dimensions: 0.2 mm posterior and 0.6 mm superior. Dose???volume histogram analyses for the VIM had no significant differences between responders and nonresponders between 20 Gy and 140 Gy, mean or maximum dose, and dose to small volumes. Tractography data was obtained for 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS For tremor control in early responders, the Elements Basal Ganglia Atlas autocontour for the VIM provides the optimal SRS target location that is 0.7???0.9 mm lateral to the VIM center.

N2  -  Separating the decay signal from diffusion-weighted scans into two or more components can be challenging. The phasor technique is well established in the field of optical microscopy for visualization and separation of fluorescent dyes with different lifetimes. The use of the phasor technique for separation of diffusion-weighted decay signals was recently proposed. In this study, we investigate the added value of this technique for fitting decay models and visualization of decay rates. Phasor visualization was performed in five glioblastoma patients. Using simulations, the influence of incorrect diffusivity values and of the number of b-values on fitting a three-component model with fixed diffusivities (dubbed "unmixing") was investigated for both a phasor-based fit and a linear least squares (LLS) fit. Phasor-based intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) fitting was compared with nonlinear least squares (NLLS) and segmented fitting (SF) methods in terms of accuracy and precision. The distributions of the parameter estimates of simulated data were compared with those obtained in a healthy volunteer. In the phasor visualizations of two glioblastoma patients, a cluster of points was observed that was not seen in healthy volunteers. The identified cluster roughly corresponded to the enhanced edge region of the tumor of two glioblastoma patients visible on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. For fitting decay models the usefulness of the phasor transform is less pronounced, but the additional knowledge gained from the geometrical configuration of phasor space can aid fitting routines. This has led to slightly improved fitting results for the IVIM model: phasor-based fitting yielded parameter maps with higher precision than the NLLS and SF methods for parameters f and D (interquartile range [IQR] for f: NLLS 27, SF 12, phasor 5.7%; IQR for D: NLLS 0.28, SF 0.18, phasor 0.10 mu m(2)/s). For unmixing, LLS fitting slightly but consistently outperformed phasor-based fitting in all of the tested scenarios.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that lesions in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome are often isointense on diffusion-weighted MR images. We hypothesized that 1) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps using various thresholds would show larger abnormalities in posterior white matter (WM) and 2) isointense appearance of lesions on isotropic diffusion-weighted images results from a balance of T2 prolongation effects and diffusibility effects.
METHODS: T2-weighted MR images from 11 patients were reviewed. Hyperintense lesions were located in both anterior and posterior WM in eight patients and solely in posterior WM in three patients. The ADC maps were produced by use of ADC values greater than or equal to 3 SD and greater than or equal to 10 SD above the mean value of normal WM. Lesions on diffusion-weighted images were classified as isointense or hypointense. ADC values within lesions (ADC(L)) were compared with those of normal WM (ADC(N)), and compared for isointense lesions and hypointense lesions.; RESULTS: The distribution of lesions with ADC values greater than or equal to 3 SD was essentially identical to that on T2-weighted images. Regions with ADC values greater than or equal to 10 SD were found in both anterior WM and posterior WM in two patients and solely in posterior WM in nine patients. On diffusion-weighted images, lesions appeared isointense in seven patients and hypointense in four patients. Mean ADC(L)ADC(N) for all lesions was 1.81; for hypointense lesions, 2.30.; CONCLUSION. Vasogenic edema was more severe in posterior WM. Isointense lesions result from a balance of T2 effects and increased water diffusibility. Hypointense lesions have higher ADC values, which are not balanced by T2 effects.

N2  -  Background: A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia. Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration.
Methods: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded.; Results: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 2127 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities. However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities.; Conclusions: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed. DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In the past, the outcome of surgical treatment for thalamic tumor was poor. These lesions were often considered inoperable. However, contemporary microsurgical techniques, together with improvements in neuroimaging that enable accurate presurgical planning, allow resection to be accomplished in a safer way.
METHODS The medical records, imaging studies, and operative and pathology reports obtained for pediatric patients who were treated for thalamic tumors at the authors' department were reviewed. Neuronavigation and intraoperative monitoring of motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were used. Preoperative tractography, which helped to identify internal capsule fibers, was very important in selecting the surgical strategy. Postoperatively, an MRI study performed within 24 hours was used to assess the extent of tumor resection as partial (<= 90%), subtotal (> 90%), or gross total (no residual tumor).; RESULTS Since 2002, 27 children with thalamic tumors have been treated at the authors' department. There were 9 patients with unilateral thalamic tumors, 16 with thalamopeduncular tumors, and 2 with a bilateral tumor. These last 2 patients underwent endoscopic biopsy and implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Thirty-nine tumor debulking procedures were performed in the remaining 25 patients. Different surgical approaches were chosen according to tumor location and displacement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (as studied on axial T2-weighted MRI) and corticospinal tract (as studied on diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, after it became available). In 12 cases, multiple procedures were performed; in 7 cases, these were done as part of a planned multistage resection. In the remaining 5 cases, the second procedure was necessary because of late recurrence or regrowth of residual tumor.; At the end of the surgical phase, of 25 patients, 15 (60%) achieved a gross-total resection, 4 (16%) achieved a subtotal resection, and 6 (24%) achieved a partial resection. Eighteen patients harbored low-grade tumors in our series. In this group, the mean follow-up was 45 months (range 4-132 months). At the end of follow-up, 1 patient was dead, 12 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 4 patients were alive with stable disease, and 1 was lost to follow-up. All patients were independent in their daily lives. The outcome of high-grade tumors in 9 patients was very poor: 2 patients died immediately after surgery, 6 died of progressive disease, and 1 was alive with residual disease at the time of this report.; CONCLUSIONS This institutional review seems to offer further evidence in favor of attempts at radical resection in pediatric patients harboring unilateral thalamic or thalamopeduncular tumors. In low-grade gliomas, radical resection in a single or staged procedure can be curative without complementary treatment. Recurrences or residual regrowth can be safely managed surgically. In high-grade tumors, the role of and opportunity for radical or partial resection remains a matter of debate.

N2  -  Purpose: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor and frequently recurs in the same location after radiotherapy. Intensive treatment targeting localized lesion is required to improve GBM outcome, but dose escalation using conventional methods is limited by healthy tissue tolerance. Helical Tomotherapy (HT) Dose Painting (DP) treatments were simulated to safely deliver high doses in the recurrent regions.
Materials and methods: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) data from five recurrent GBM were retrospectively considered for planning. Hypo-fractionated (25-50 Gy, 5 fractions) voxel-based prescriptions were opportunely converted to personalized structured-based dose maps to create DP plans with a commercial Treatment Planning System. Optimized plans were generated and analyzed in terms of plan conformity to dose prescription (Q(0.90-1.10)), tolerance of the healthy tissues (D-MAX), and dosimetry accuracy of the deliverable plans (gamma-index).; Results: Only three of the five cases could receive a safe retreatment without violating the maximum critical organs dose constraints. The conformity of the simulated plans was between 40.9% and 79.9% (Q(0.90-1.10)), their delivery time was in the range of 38.3-63.6 min, while the dosimetry showed gamma-index of 82.4-92.4%.; Conclusions: This study proved the ability of our method to simulate personalized, deliverable and dosimetrically accurate DPBN plans. HT hypo-fractionated treatments guided by ADC maps can be realized and applied to deliver high doses in the GBM recurrent regions, although there are some critical issues related to low Q(0.90-1.10) values, to exceeding of healthy-tissue dose constraints for some patients and long delivery times.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subcortical low-intensity lesion on T2-weighted images is an uncommon manifestation of ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber disease. This study was performed to determine whether subcortical low signal intensity is an MR feature of meningitis, viral encephalitis, or leptomeningeal metastasis and to investigate a cause of subcortical low intensity.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images of 117 patients with meningitis, encephalitis (viral or unknown), or leptomeningeal metastasis for the presence of subcortical low intensity, meningeal enhancement, signal intensity change of cortex, and change in subcortical low intensity on follow-up images. Diffusion-weighted (DW) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained in 55 patients. Subcortical low-intensity lesions were also quantitatively analyzed on T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and DW images.; RESULTS: Subcortical low intensity was found in nine (23.7%) of 38 patients with encephalitis (viral, 31; unknown origin, 7), five (24%) of 21 with leptomeningeal metastasis, and five (9%) of 58 with meningitis. Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in 100% and cortical hyperintensity in 14 (74%) of 19 patients with subcortical low intensity. Leptomeningeal enhancement was seen in 46 (47%) and cortical hyperintensity in 33 (34%) of 98 patients without subcortical low intensity. Subcortical low intensity disappeared or decreased in extent on follow-up MR images in all seven patients who underwent follow-up. ADC of subcortical low-intensity lesions was lower than that of the contralateral area and decreased by 9.3 +- 11.4%.; CONCLUSION. Subcortical low intensity was uncommonly found in meningitis, viral encephalitis, and leptomeningeal metastasis. It is a nonspecific MR sign of various meningeal and cortical diseases. Although the cause of subcortical low intensity remains uncertain, free radical formation may play a role as a causative factor.

N2  -  Reversible splenial lesions (RSL) of the corpus callosum have been described in various clinical conditions, and some are attributed to the action of antiepileptic drugs (AED). Abrupt withdrawal of an AED in preparation for surgical treatment can result in RSL of the corpus callosum in patients with trigeminal neuralgia who do not have epilepsy. We report two patients who developed RSL following surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Since our two patients did not have epilepsy, it is strongly suggested that the AED, rather than convulsive status epilepticus, could be a contributing factor in RSL. The pathogenesis of AED-associated RSL is not clear. Similar RSL can appear under various circumstances, implying that factors other than AED can influence a common end-point mechanism that results in RSL. Nevertheless, delirium after surgery may be a cue for inquiring about RSL. This condition is transient and represents a clinicoradiological syndrome with an excellent prognosis. We should consider this phenomenon in the perioperative period after surgery for trigeminal neuralgia to avoid invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Previous lesion behavior studies primarily used univariate lesion behavior mapping techniques to map the anatomical basis of spatial neglect after right brain damage. These studies led to inconsistent results and lively controversies. Given these inconsistencies, the idea of a wide-spread network that might underlie spatial orientation and neglect has been pushed forward. In such case, univariate lesion behavior mapping methods might have been inherently limited in detecting the presumed network due to limited statistical power. By comparing various univariate analyses with multivariate lesion-mapping based on support vector regression, we aimed to validate the network hypothesis directly in a large sample of 203 newly recruited right brain damaged patients. If the exact same correction factors and parameter combinations (FDR correction and dTLVC for lesion size control) were used, both univariate as well as multivariate approaches uncovered the same complex network pattern underlying spatial neglect. At the cortical level, lesion location dominantly affected the temporal cortex and its borders into inferior parietal and occipital cortices. Beyond, frontal and subcortical gray matter regions as well as white matter tracts connecting these regions were affected. Our findings underline the importance of a right network in spatial exploration and attention and specifically in the emergence of the core symptoms of spatial neglect.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have shown MR imaging features and ADC correlating with molecular markers and survival in patients with glioma. Our purpose was to correlate MR imaging features and ADC with molecular subtyping and survival in adult diffuse gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presurgical MRIs and ADC maps of 131 patients with diffuse gliomas and available molecular and survival data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were reviewed. MR imaging features, ADC (obtained by ROIs within the lowest ADC area), and mean relative ADC values were evaluated to predict isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, 1p19q codeletion status, MGMT promoter methylation, and overall survival.; RESULTS: IDH wild-type gliomas tended to exhibit enhancement, necrosis, and edema; >50% enhancing area (P < .001); absence of a cystic area (P = .013); and lower mean relative ADC (median, 1.1 versus 1.6; P < .001) than IDH-mutant gliomas. By means of a cutoff value of 1.08 for mean relative ADC, IDH-mutant and IDH wild-type gliomas with lower mean relative ADC (<1.08) had poorer survival than those with higher mean relative ADC (median survival time, 24.2 months; 95% CI, 0.0-54.9 months versus 62.0 months; P = .003; and median survival time, 10.4 months; 95% CI, 4.4-16.4 months versus 17.7 months; 95% CI, 11.6-23.7 months; P = .041, respectively), regardless of World Health Organization grade. Median survival of those with IDH-mutant glioma with low mean relative ADC was not significantly different from that in those with IDH wild-type glioma. Other MR imaging features were not statistically significant predictors of survival.; CONCLUSIONS: IDH wild-type glioma showed lower ADC values, which also correlated with poor survival in both IDH-mutant and IDH wild-type gliomas, irrespective of histologic grade. A subgroup with IDH-mutant gliomas with lower ADC had dismal survival similar to that of those with IDH wild-type gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging features of HE have not been fully established. The purpose of this study was to determine the topographic distribution and DWI findings of HE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated HE MR imaging (n = 11). The topographic distribution of the lesions was evaluated on routine MR imaging, and DWI SI and ADC values were assessed. The ADC value of involved lesions was compared with the noninvolved subcortical WM area by use of the paired t test.; RESULTS: MR images demonstrated bilateral diffusion-restrictive lesions in the posterior limb of the IC (n = 6), cerebral cortex (n = 8), CR (n = 7), CS (n = 9), hippocampus (n = 4), and BG (n = 1). The mean ADC value of lesions was 448.82 +- 92.34 x 10(-6) mm(2)s compared with the mean ADC value of noninvolved lesions (837.72 +- 62.14 X 10-6 mm(2)s); this difference was statistically significant (P < .000). The lesions showed complete resolution on follow-up DWI for 6 patients. Three patients with cortical involvement of >= 2 lobes showed partial recovery or death, but most of the other patients with WM involvement or cortical involvement in only 1 lobe experienced complete recovery.; CONCLUSIONS: The topographic localization of the lesions was the posterior limb of the IC, cerebral cortex, CR, CS, hippocampus, and BG. Most HE lesions probably correspond to areas of reversible cytotoxic edema as seen on DWI, which car predict the prognosis of HE according to the degree of lesion extent.

N2  -  Background and purpose: The paper presents the operative technique and the results of treatment of adult patients with primary tumours of the hypothalamus, including rare ones. The aim of the study was to show the possibility of safe surgical treatment of rare tumours of the hypothalamus through a bifrontal basal interhemispheric trans-lamina terminalis approach.
Material and methods: Five patients with tumours of the hypothalamus were operated on in the Neurosurgical Clinic in Sosnowiec between 1990 and 2008. There were 2 patients with craniopharyngiomas located exclusively in the third ventricle, and single patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis X and hamartoma of the hypothalamus each. The patients were treated surgically with a bifrontal basal interhemispheric trans-lamina terminalis approach. In two cases, the neuronavigation system with the use of tractography (DTI) was used to determine the location of the lamina terminalis, the posterior surface of the optic chiasm and the optic tracts.; Results: All lesions were resected totally, except for partially resected hamartoma of the hypothalamus. The most common postoperative complication was diabetes insipidus, which was transient in two cases. A long-lasting follow-up of all the patients operated on did not reveal regrowth of the lesion.; Conclusions: The bifrontal basal interhemispheric trans-lamina terminalis approach allows for radical resection of primary tumours of the hypothalamus while avoiding serious postoperative deficits. This approach enabled the preservation of the olfactory bulb and tract and prevented damage of the frontal lobes. The use of DTI helped to establish the location and borders of the lamina terminalis, to establish the posterior surface of the optic chiasm and the optic tracts, and to save the anterior and lateral wall of the hypothalamus.

N2  -  IntroductionTacrolimus-associated neurotoxicity (TAN) manifests with wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild tremors to severe encephalopathy. The isolated involvement of the brainstem is a rarely documented presentation of TAN, and its clinical and diagnostic characteristics are unclear.MethodsWe report two cases of brainstem-isolated TAN (bi-TAN). Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the literature on bi-TAN and extracted data concerning demographics, clinical characteristics, radiological features, and management. The systematic literature search followed PRISMA guidelines and a pre-defined protocol.ResultsEleven patients, including our two, were identified (mean age: 41.3 years, +/- 18.8; five males, 45%). Speech disturbance was the most common clinical presentation (45%). The mean latency from Tacrolimus initiation to bi-TAN onset was 26 days (+/- 30.8). Tacrolimus serum level tested above the reference range in three patients (mean: 26.83 +/- 5.48). Brain MRI showed T2-FLAIR hyperintensities; three showed restricted diffusion on ADC maps. Neurological symptoms resolved completely in seven patients (63%) after Tacrolimus withdrawal or dose reduction.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that bi-TAN could represent a brainstem variant of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Recognition of bi-TAN as a potential cause of isolated brainstem lesions is crucial to disentangle the diagnostic work-up and ensure prompt withdrawal or reduction of the offending agent.

N2  -  Purpose: To explore the role of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps obtained at standard- and high-b-value (1000 and 3000 sec/mm(2), respectively) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression in glioblastoma treated with radiation therapy and concomitant temozolomide.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital, and informed consent requirement was waived. Thirty patients with histopathologically proved glioblastoma who had undergone concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CCRT) with temozolomide underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging with b values of 1000 and 3000 secmm(2), and corresponding ADC maps were calculated from entire newly developed or enlarged enhancing lesions after completion of CCRT. Histogram parameters of each ADC map between true progression (n = 15) and pseudoprogression (n = 15) groups were compared by using the unpaired Student t test. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the best cutoff values for predictors in the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression. Results were validated in an independent test set of nine patients by using the best cutoff value to predict differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression. The accuracy of the selected best cutoff value in the independent test set was then calculated.; Results: In terms of cumulative histograms, the fifth percentile of both ADC at b value of 1000 secmm(2) (ADC(1000)) and the ADC at b value of 3000 secmm(2) (ADC(3000)) were significantly lower in the true progression group than in the pseudoprogression group (P = .049 and P < .001, respectively). In contrast, neither the mean ADC(1000) nor the mean ADC(3000) was significantly different between the two groups. The diagnostic values of the parameters derived from ADC(1000) and ADC(3000) were compared, and a significant difference (0.224, P = .016) was found between the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the fifth percentile for ADC(1000) and that for ADC(3000). The accuracies were 66.7% (six of nine patients) and 88.9% (eight of nine patients) based on the fifth percentile of both ADC(1000) and ADC(3000) in the independent test set, respectively.; Conclusion: The fifth percentile of the cumulative ADC histogram obtained at a high b value was the most promising parameter in the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression of the newly developed or enlarged enhancing lesions after CCRT with temozolomide for glioblastoma treatment.

N2  -  Contrast reagents (CRs) may enter the tissue interstitium for a period after a vascular bolus injection. As the amount of interstitial CR increases, the longitudinal relaxographic NMR "shutter-speed" (T-1) for the equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange process increases. The quantity T-1 is given by \r(10)[CRo] + R-1o0 - R-1i\ (where r(1o) and [CRo] represent the interstitial (extracellular) CR relaxivity and concentration, respectively, and R-1o0 and R-1i are the extra- and intracellular (H2O)-H-1 relaxation rate constants, respectively, in the absence of exchange). The increase of T-1 with [CRo] causes the kinetics of the water exchange equilibrium to appear to decrease. Here, analytical theory for two-site-exchange processes is combined with that for pharmacokinetic CR delivery, extraction, and distribution in a method termed BOLus Enhanced Relaxation Overview (BOLERO(C)). The shutter-speed effect alters the shape of the bolus-tracking (B-T) time-course. It is shown that this is mostly accounted for by the inclusion of only one additional parameter, which measures the mean intracellular lifetime of a water molecule. Simulated and real data demonstrate that the effect of shutter-speed variation on pharmacokinetic parameters can be very significant: neglecting this effect can lead to an underestimation of the parameter values by 50%. This phenomenon can be heterogeneous. Within a tiny gliosarcoma implanted in the rat brain, the interstitial CR in the tumor core never rises to a level sufficient to cause apparent slowing of the exchange process. However, within the few microns needed to reach the proliferating rim, this occurs to a significant degree. Thus, even relative pharmacokinetic quantities can be incorrectly represented in a parametric map that neglects this effect. The BOLERO analysis shows promise for in vivo vascular phenotyping in pathophysiology. It also includes a provision for approximating the separation of the perfusion and permeability contributions to CR extravasation. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  To demonstrate the accuracy of magnetic resonance tractograpghy (MRT) in localizing the cortical spinal tract (CST) close to brain tumours by using intraoperative electric subcortical stimulation.
Nine patients with intra-axial brain tumours underwent neurosurgery. Planning was based on analysis of the course of streamlines compatible with the CST. After tumour removal, intraoperative MRT was reacquired. Sites at various distance from the CST were repeatedly stimulated to assess whether registered motor evoked potential (MEP) could be elicited. All patients were assessed clinically both pre- and postoperatively.; The motor function was preserved in all patients. In all patients intraoperative MRT demonstrated shift of the bundle position caused by the surgical procedure. The distance between the estimated intraoperative CST and the point of elicited MEP was 1 cm or less in all nine patients. At distances greater than 2 cm, no patient reported positive MEP.; Intraoperative MRT is a reliable technique for localization of CST. In all patients MEP were elicited by direct subcortical electrical stimulation at a distance below 1 cm from the CST as represented by MRT. Brain shifting might impact this evaluation since CST position may change during surgery in the range of 8 mm.

N2  -  Introduction: Post-stroke dysphagia and communication impairments occur in two-thirds of acute stroke survivors. Identifying the shared neuroanatomical substrate for related impairments could facilitate the development of cross-system therapies. Our purpose was to elucidate discrete brain regions predictive of the combined presence of dysphagia alongside dysarthria and/or aphasia post-stroke. Methods: We included 40 right hemisphere stroke (RHS) and 67 left hemisphere stroke (LHS) patients from an acute ischemic stroke cohort with lesions demarcated on diffusion-weighted imaging. We undertook binary non-parametric voxel-lesion symptom mapping with a false discovery rate of p < 0.05 for co-occurring dysphagia, dysarthria, and aphasia (LHS only). If no voxels survived the threshold, a cluster analysis of >20 voxels involving an uncorrected p < 0.01 was applied to identify brain regions associated with the co-occurring impairments. Results: Cluster analyses revealed that dysphagia and dysarthria were associated with insular and superior temporal gyrus (STG) involvement after RHS and with basal ganglia (BG), internal capsule, and thalamic involvement after LHS. Co-occurring dysphagia, dysarthria, and aphasia were associated with BG, STG, and insular cortex involvement. Discussion: Our findings highlight the role of the insula and structures of the BG in co-occurrence patterns involving dysphagia, dysarthria, and aphasia. These newly identified biomarkers may inform new rehabilitation therapeutic targets for treating cross-system functions.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The cerebral isthmus is the white matter area located between the periinsular sulcus and the lateral ventricle. Studies demonstrating the fiber tract and topographic anatomy of this entity are lacking in current neurosurgical literature. Hence, the authors' primary aim was to describe the microsurgical white matter anatomy of the cerebral isthmus by using the fiber dissection technique, and they discuss its functional significance. In addition, they sought to investigate its possible surgical utility in approaching lesions located in or adjacent to the lateral ventricle.
METHODS This study was divided into 2 parts and included 30 formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres, 5 of which were injected with colored silicone. In the first part, 15 uncolored specimens underwent the Klinger's procedure and were dissected in a lateromedial direction at the level of the superior, inferior, and anterior isthmuses, and 10 were used for coronal and axial cuts. In the second part, the injected specimens were used to investigate the surgical significance of the superior isthmus in accessing the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle.; RESULTS The microsurgical anatomy of the anterior, superior, and inferior cerebral isthmuses was carefully studied and recorded both in terms of topographic and fiber tract anatomy. In addition, the potential role of the proximal part of the superior isthmus as an alternative safe surgical corridor to the anterior part of the lateral ventricle was investigated.; CONCLUSIONS Using the fiber dissection technique along with coronal and axial cuts in cadaveric brain specimens remains a cornerstone in the acquisition of thorough anatomical knowledge of narrow white matter areas such as the cerebral isthmus. The surgical significance of the superior isthmus in approaching the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle is stressed, but further studies must be carried out to elucidate its role in ventricular surgery.

N2  -  Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) represent a unique subset of brain tumours that primarily affect the paediatric population. Traditionally, these tumours are managed conservatively due to their location to and association with vital structures. This article explores the evolving role of surgery in the management of OPGs, particularly in the context of advancements in precision medicine. The advent of targeted therapy, especially for tumours with specific genetic alterations, such as BRAF V600E mutations, has revolutionized the treatment landscape, offering new avenues for patient-specific therapy. However, surgery still plays a crucial role, especially for debulking in cases of hydrocephalus or when standard therapies are ineffective. Advances in surgical techniques, including neuronavigation, endoscopic approaches, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, have enhanced the safety and efficacy of operative interventions. Despite these developments, the complexity of OPGs necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, focusing on long-term outcomes and quality of life. Future research is needed to further elucidate the role of surgery in an era increasingly dominated by molecular genetics and targeted therapies.

N2  -  -BACKGROUND: Intracranial solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is characterized by aggressive local behavior and high post-resection recurrence rates. It is difficult to distinguish between SFT and meningiomas, which are typically benign. The goal of this study was to systematically review radiological features that differentiate meningioma and SFT.-METHODS: We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify studies that used imaging techniques to identify radio-logical differentiators of SFT and meningioma. -RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 1565 patients (SFT: 662; meningiomas: 903) were included. The most commonly used imaging modality was diffusion weighted imaging, which was reported in 11 studies. Eight studies used a combination of diffusion weighted imaging and T1-and T2-weighted sequences to distinguish between SFT and meningioma. Compared to all grades/subtypes of meningioma, SFT is associated with higher apparent diffusion coefficient, presence of narrow-based dural attachments, lack of dural tail, less peritumoral brain edema, extensive serpentine flow voids, and younger age at initial diag-nosis. Tumor volume was a poor differentiator of SFT and meningioma, and overall, there were less consensus findings in studies exclusively comparing angiomatous meningiomas andSFT. -CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can differentiate SFT from meningiomas on pre-operative imaging by looking for higher apparent diffusion coefficient, lack of dural tail/narrow-based dural attachment, less peritumoral brain edema, and vascular flow voids on neuroimaging, in addition to younger age at diagnosis. Distinguishing between angiomatous meningioma and SFT is much more chal-lenging, as both are highly vascular pathologies. Tumor volume has limited utility in differentiating between SFT and various grades/subtypes of meningioma.

N2  -  Subcortical aphasia develops as a result of damage to subcortical brain areas without loss of cortical functions. Although earlier voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) studies have shown possible neural correlates for aphasia, it remains to be clarified which brain regions are associated with subcortical aphasia. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural substrates associated with subcortical aphasia in patients with stroke using VLSM and atlas-based analyses to explore the involvement of white matter tracts and subcortical structures. Fifty patients with subacute subcortical stroke without cortical involvement were retrospectively enrolled: 24 with and 26 without aphasia. We performed VLSM and atlas-based analyses of the patients' fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and found that the left perisylvian white matter, left fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and forceps minor were significantly more greatly affected in the aphasia than in the non-aphasia group. The left anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum (cingulate gyrus), and superior longitudinal fasciculus also showed higher involvement in this group (marginal significance). Among the subcortical regions, the left caudate and putamen were more greatly involved in the aphasia group. Our findings confirm language processing as one of the integrated sensory-motor processes that occur in the region around the left sylvian fissure. Our atlas-based analysis approach can be used to complement VLSM analyses.

N2  -  Currently, there are few studies on cognitive impairment caused by neurosurgery, and there have been no studies on cognitive impairment after resection of lateral ventricular tumors in children. Previously, our research team has reported that the frontal transcortical approach can impair cognitive function. In this study, we explored which functions would be damaged by the transcallosal approach and compared the cognitive function changes caused by the two surgical approaches, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the selection of pre-operative surgical approaches. The authors prospectively collected pediatric patients with lateral ventricular tumors who had undergone surgical resection through the frontal transcortical approach and anterior transcallosal approach in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from November 2012 to May 2017. The inclusion criteria according to the Children Wechsler Scale requirements and clinical performance were formulated. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (R)-fourth edition: Chinese version (WISC-IV) was adopted for general intelligence and cognitive function assessment in the study. In addition, the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were carried out to measure the level of co-activation and to explore the functional connectivity between the brain regions at the pre-operative period and 6-month follow-up in post-operation. A total of 30 patients were enrolled. Gross total resection was achieved in all patients, and no severe post-operative complications were observed. The frontal transcortical approach was applied in 19 patients, and the transcallosal approach was conducted for 11 patients. Compared with the pre-operative indices of WISC-IV, patients generally had a lower level of indices of the WISC-IV in post-operation. In patients accepting lateral ventricular tumors resection through the anterior transcallosal approach, the total IQ was declined to M = 84.82, SD = 8.072 from M = 93.27, SD = 6.635 within the 6-month convalescence. The data of working memory (t = - 2.990, p = 0.002) and total IQ (t = - 2.205, p = 0.028) pre- and post-operative showed statistical significance. But in the comparison of two surgical approaches, it was found that IQ had no statistical difference in WISC-IV tasks data. Previous studies suggest that the frontal transcortical approach impair perceptual reasoning, processing speed, and IQ, while this study indicates that the anterior transcallosal approach impairs patients' working memory and IQ. Both approaches make equal damage to IQ. Through comparing the two surgical approaches, it can be known that the anterior transcallosal approach cannot replace the frontal transcortical approach. The protection of cognitive function should be considered as one of the bases for neurosurgeons to select the operative approach before the operation. However, in an actual situation, the specific approach should be carefully selected by comprehensive consideration.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Previous studies have suggested a correlation between interhemispheric sensorimotor networks and recovery from supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome. In the present study, the authors examined the hypothesis that interhemispheric connectivity of the primary motor cortex in one hemisphere with the contralateral SMA may be important in the recovery from SMA syndrome. Further, they posited that motor cortical fiber connectivity with the SMA is related to the severity of SMA syndrome.
METHODS Patients referred to the authors' neurological surgery department were retrospectively analyzed for this study. All patients with tumors involving the unilateral SMA region, without involvement of the primary motor area, and diagnosed with SMA syndrome in the postoperative period were eligible for inclusion. Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography (DTT) was used to examine the number of fiber tracts (NFidx) connecting the contralateral SMA to the ipsilateral primary motor area via the corpus callosum. Complete neurological examination had been performed in all patients in the pre- and postoperative periods. All patients were divided into two groups: those who recovered from SMA syndrome in <= 7 days (early recovery group) and those who recovered in >= 8 days (late recovery group). Differences between the two groups were assessed using the Student t-test and the chi-square test.; RESULTS Eleven patients (10 men, 1 woman) were included in the study. All patients showed transient postoperative motor deficits because of SMA syndrome. Tractography data revealed NFidx from the contralateral SMA to the ipsilateral primary motor area via the corpus callosum. The mean tumor volume (early 27.87 vs late 50.91 cm(3), p = 0.028) and mean NFidx (early 8923.16 vs late 4726.4, p = 0.002) were significantly different between the two groups. Fisher exact test showed a significant difference in the days of recovery from SMA syndrome between patients with an NFidx > 8000 and those with an NFidx < 8000.; CONCLUSIONS Diffusion tensor imaging tractography may be useful for predicting the speed of recovery from SMA syndrome. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first DTT study to identify interhemispheric connectivity of the SMA in patients with brain tumors.

N2  -  Objective. This is an over-view of the cellular biology of upper nasal mucosal cells that have special characteristics that enable them to be used to diagnose and study congenital neurological diseases and to aid neural repair. Study Design: After mapping the distribution of neural cells in the upper nose, the authors' investigations moved to the use of olfactory neurones to diagnose neurological diseases of development, especially schizophrenia. Olfactory-ensheating glial cells (OEGs) from the cranial cavity promote axonal penetration of the central nervous system and aid spinal cord repair in rodents. The authors sought to isolate these cells from the more accessible upper nasal cavity in rats and in humans and prove they could likewise promote neural regeneration, making these cells suitable for human spinal repair investigations. Methods: The schizophrenia-diagnosis aspect of the study entailed the biopsy of the olfactory areas of 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 control subjects. The tissue samples were sliced and grown in culture medium. The ease of cell attachment to fibronectin (artificial epithelial basement membrane), as well as the mitotic and apoptotic indices, was studied in the presence and absence of dopamine in those cell cultures. The neural repair part of the study entailed a harvesting and insertion of first rat olfactory lamina propria rich in OEGs between cut ends of the spinal cords and then later the microinjection of an OEG-rich suspension into rat spinal cords previously transected by open laminectomy. Further studies were done in which OEG insertion was performed up to 1 month after rat cord transection and also in monkeys. Results: Schizophrenic patients' olfactory tissues do not easily attach to basement membrane compared with control subjects, adding evidence to the theory that cell wall anomalies are part of the schizophrenic "lesion" of neurones. Schizophrenic patient cell cultures had higher mitotic and apoptotic indices compared with control subjects. The addition of dopamine altered these indices enough to allow accurate differentiation of schizophrenics from control patients, leading to, possibly for the first time, an early objective diagnosis of schizophrenia and possible assessment of preventive strategies. OEGs from the nose were shown to be as effective as those from the olfactory bulb in promoting axonal growth across transected spinal cords even when added I month after injury in the rat. These otherwise paraplegic rats grew motor and proprioceptive and fine touch fibers with corresponding behavioral improvement. Conclusions. The tissues of the olfactory mucosa are readily available to the otolaryngologist. Being surface cells, they must regenerate (called "neurogenesis"). Biopsy of this area and amplification of cells in culture gives the scientist a "window to the developing brain," including early diagnosis of schizophrenia. The "Holy Grail" of neurological disease is the cure of traumatic paraplegia and OEGs from the nose promote that repair. The otolaryngologist may become the necessary partner of the neurophysiologist and spinal surgeon to take the laboratory potential of paraplegic cure into the day-to-day realm of clinical reality.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Intraoperative identification and preservation of the corticospinal tract is often necessary for glioma resection.
OBJECTIVE: To make a proposal for intraoperative management with the high-frequency monopolar stimulation technique for monitoring the corticospinal tract.; METHODS: Ninety-two patients operated on with the assistance of the high-frequency monopolar stimulation. Clinical and neurophysiological data have been related with the motor status at 3 months to establish prognostic factors of motor deterioration.; RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22.8%) presented intraoperative alterations in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Twelve (13%) presented an increment in the MEP threshold >= 5 mA (no deficit at 3 months). Two (2.2%) presented an MEP amplitude reduction >50% (100% deficit at 3 months). Seven (7.6%) had an intraoperative MEP loss (80% deficit at 3 months). Subcortical stimulation was positive in 75 patients (81.5%). Eighty-five patients were available for the analysis at 3 months. Fourteen presented new deficits (16.5%). Among them, 5 presented a deficit in nonmonitored muscles (5.9%) and 1 presented a new deficit not detected intraoperatively. The combination of patients with preoperative motor deficits, MEP deterioration, or loss and intensity of subcortical stimulation >= 3 mA showed the highest sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of new deficits.; CONCLUSIONS: Persistent MEP loss or deterioration is associated with a high probability of new deficits. It seems recommendable to stop the subcortical resection before obtaining a subcortical MEP threshold at 3 mA especially in patients with preoperative motor deficits. A careful selection of muscles for the registration of MEPs is mandatory to avoid deficits in nonmonitored muscles.

N2  -  Aim of the study To summarize the results gained with awake craniotomies, which were performed in either low grade glioma patients or epilepsy surgical patients whose tumor or epileptogenic zone, was in the vicinity of eloquent, mostly language, cortices.
Patient selection and methods In our retrospective study we selected 16 patients who were operated awake between 1999-2011 at the Neurosurgical Department of MAV Korhaz Budapest, or at the National Institute of Neurosciences in Budapest, or at the Neurosurgical Department of the University of Debrecen in Debrecen. In the presurgical evaluation if it was possible we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging, tractography and detailed neuropsychological testing. At the National Institute of Neurosciences all patients were operated with the aid of MR guided neuronavigation.; Results Anesthesia was carried out without complications in all of the 16 cases. Monitoring of sleep deepness has significantly contributed to the safety of anesthesia during the superficial anesthezied states of the operation. The intraoperative neuropsychological tasks used for testing language were sensitive enough to judge the little disturbances in speech during stimulation. Stimulation evoked seizures could be adequately managed during surgery and did not influence the outcome of the procedures. The use of neuronavigation helped significantly by planning the optimal place for the craniotomy and by intraoperative orientation.; Conclusions Awake craniotomies require well practiced surgical teams, which requires the cooperation of neuro-anesthesiologits, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologist and electrophysiologists. It has two goals, first to reduce the time of surgery to minimize surgical complications, secondly the detailed intraoperative mapping of cognitive and motor functions to avoid any neurological deficit. The intraoperative anatomical data provided by the neuronavigation and the functional data provided by awake intraoperative stimulation of the patient together serve the safety of the patient which is essential in the neurologically minimal invasive neurosurgical approach of the 21st century.

N2  -  Intracranial cavernous malformation is a unique entity of angiographically occult vascular malformation. Complete removal of the lesion is required to prevent recurring hemorrhagic events.(1,2) A right basal ganglia cavernousmalformation (BGCM) was accidentally found in a 38-year-old woman in health examination for more than 2 years. The follow-up MRI examination showed significant enlargement of the BGCM, and the angiography confirmed no major arteries or deep perforators around or within the lesion. We planned the microsurgical BGCM resection, and informed consent was obtained from the patient and her family. The diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated that the cortical spinal tract was posterior to the lesion. Therefore, after the frontotemporal craniotomy and dural opening, we located the right frontal pars opercularis and confirmed the surgical trajectory by the "2-point method" under neuronavigation guidance.(2,3) We incised the parenchyma of the pars opercularis and exposed the brown lesion. After cutting inside, we released the old blood for decompression and peeled off the lesion along its gliosis boundary. Extreme care should be taken not to injure the internal capsule and cortical spinal tract. The lesion was totally removed eventually. The motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were stable during the whole operation. The intraoperative MRI showed gross total resection of the BGCM. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged without sequelae. The 7-month follow-up showed complete remission of the BGCM without recurrence. We hoped this case demonstrated the surgical nuances of the BGCM.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Lesions arising at the ventral thalamopeduncular junction are difficult to resect. In addition to being relatively inaccessible, these lesions are located in one of the most sensitive areas of the brain. A critical question is whether new approaches could be developed to allow surgeons to adequately resect these lesions with reasonable outcomes. In the present report, we describe our approach to resect lesions in this region of the brain using an eyebrow craniotomy approach with a trajectory through the supracarotid triangle.
METHODS: Through retrospective data collection, we present a small series of patients who had undergone an eyebrow, supracarotid triangle approach to resect lesions located at the thalamopeduncular junction. We describe our surgical technique and report patient outcomes using this approach.; RESULTS: Three patients had undergone an eyebrow, supracarotid approach for resection of a lesion arising at the ventral thalamopeduncular junction. Two patients had presented with a cavernoma and one with a pilocytic astrocytoma. Complete resection of all 3 lesions was achieved during surgery without any intraoperative complications. No patient developed permanent contralateral weakness despite entering the peduncle during surgery. One patient developed permanent paresthesia in his left hand.; CONCLUSIONS: Lesions arising at the ventral thalamopeduncular junction can be adequately resected with reasonable outcomes using an eyebrow, supracarotid triangle approach. This operative technique establishes another potential operative corridor by which neurosurgeons can resect lesions arising within this relatively inaccessible part of the brain.

N2  -  Objective and Importance: Transsphenoidal surgery is considered to be a safe, relatively low risk procedure for the resection of pituitary lesions. Although rare, injury to the internal carotid artery is a potentially devastating complication associated with the transsphenoidal approach. The authors report a unique case in which the patient developed mirror pseudoaneurysms of the cavernous carotid arteries after an apparently uneventful transsphenoidal procedure, a complication attributed to the reconstruction of the sellar floor.
Clinical Presentation: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presented to the emergency room with severe epistaxis nearly 4 weeks after undergoing an uncomplicated transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary adenoma. An emergency cerebral angiogram was performed which demonstrated bilateral cavernous carotid artery pseudoaneurysms, a complication attributed to the placement of a synthetic implant in the sellar floor. While on the angiography table, the patient again developed massive epistaxis, with enlargement of the left-sided pseudoaneurysm from 3.4 x 2.5 x 2.1 mm to 4.5 x 3.7 x 3 mm.; Intervention: The left cavernous carotid artery was occluded using 8 coils. The right-sided pseudoaneurysm was not treated at the time of the angiogram, and was managed conservatively. The patient subsequently developed an expressive aphasia, with an MRI revealing multiple areas of diffusion-weighted abnormalities. Within several days the patient's speech returned to normal, and he was discharged home eleven days after presenting to the emergency room. Follow-up imaging 6 weeks later showed complete obliteration of the left cavernous carotid artery with distal reconstitution, and a decrease in size of the right-sided pseudoaneurysm.; Conclusion: While considered to be a relatively safe procedure, the transsphenoidal approach for resection of pituitary lesions is not without risks. Injury to the internal carotid artery is arguably the most catastrophic complication seen with pituitary surgery. Although it typically occurs during the dural opening, or during tumor removal, this case illustrates that the neurosurgeon must be conscious of this risk throughout every aspect of the case. For cases when sellar reconstruction is performed, specific attention should be paid to ensuring that an appropriately sized graft is used.

N2  -  Distributed microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from consistent, viable, >500 mu m thick tissue preparations over time periods from days to weeks may aid in studying a wide range of problems in neurobiology that require in vivo-like organotypic morphology. Existing tools for electrically interfacing with organotypic slices do not address necrosis that inevitably occurs within thick slices with limited diffusion of nutrients and gas, and limited removal of waste. We developed an integrated device that enables long-term maintenance of thick, functionally active, brain tissue models using interstitial perfusion and distributed recordings from thick sections of explanted tissue on a perforated multi-electrode array. This novel device allows for automated culturing, in situ imaging, and extracellular multi-electrode interfacing with brain slices, 3-D cell cultures, and potentially other tissue culture models. The device is economical, easy to assemble, and integrable with standard electrophysiology tools. We found that convective perfusion through the culture thickness provided a functional benefit to the preparations as firing rates were generally higher in perfused cultures compared to their respective unperfused controls. This work is a step toward the development of integrated tools for days-long experiments with more consistent, healthier, thicker, and functionally more active tissue cultures with built-in distributed electrophysiological recording and stimulation functionality. The results may be useful for the study of normal processes, pathological conditions, and drug screening strategies currently hindered by the limitations of acute (a few hours long) brain slice preparations.

N2  -  Background: We sought to determine the impact of lesion lateralization and lesion volume on swallow impairment on group-level by comparing patients with left and right hemisphere strokes and on patient-level by analyzing patients individually.
Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study of 46 patients with unilateral (22 left, 24 right), acute, first-ever, ischemic strokes who received a diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and modified barium swallow study (MBSS) during their acute hospital stay. We determined lesion side on the DW-MRI and measured swallow physiology using the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP (TM)(C)), Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), swallow timing, distance, area, and speed measures. We performed Pearson's Chi-Square and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to compare patients with left and right hemisphere strokes, and Pearson or Spearman correlation, simple logistic regression, linear, and logistic multivariable regression modeling to assess the relationship between variables.; Results: At the group-level, there were no differences in MBSImP oral swallow impairment scores between patients with left and right hemisphere stroke. In adjusted analyses, patients with right hemisphere strokes showed significantly worse MBSImP pharyngeal total scores (p = 0.02), worse MBSImP component specific scores for laryngeal vestibular closure (Bonferroni adjusted alpha p <= 0.0029), and worse PAS scores (p = 0.03). Patients with right hemisphere strokes showed worse timing, distance, area, and speed measures. Lesion volume was significantly associated with MBSImP pharyngeal residue (p = 0.03) and pharyngeal total scores (p = 0.04). At the patient-level, 24% of patients (4 left, 7 right) showed opposite patterns of MBSImP oral and pharyngeal swallow impairment than seen at group-level.; Conclusion: Our study showed differences in swallow physiology between patients with right and left unilateral strokes with patients with right hemisphere strokes showing worse pharyngeal impairment. Lesion lateralization seems to be a valuable marker for the severity of swallowing impairment at the group-level but less informative at the patient-level.

N2  -  Background and Study Objective In surgery for gliomas and brain metastases, preservation of neurologic functions is essential to ensure a good quality of life and the eligibility for adjuvant therapies. This article assesses which factors could influence the functional outcome in patients with lesions located in the motor pathways.
Materials and Methods A total of 92 patients with gliomas and metastases involving the motor pathways were studied for concerns regarding quality of life (Karnofsky performance status KPS and modified Rankin scale mRS) before and after surgical treatment supported by intraoperative neuromonitoring. Patient-related, surgery-related, and lesion-related data were recorded to identify the relationships with postoperative performance status. The relationship between lesions and the corticospinal tract were investigated with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging sequences and tractographic reconstructions.; Results Means of preoperative mRS and KPS were 1.91 +- 1.34 and 80.8 +- 20, and at 30 days postoperatively they were 1.93 +- 1.63 and 79.8 +- 24.4, respectively. The better preoperative performance status was a predictor of better outcome in terms of quality of life. Gender showed a statistical association with KPS (p = 0.033) and mRS (p = 0.031). A recurrent lesion was a predictor of poor functional outcome (p = 0.045 for KPS at 30 days). A left-sided lesion showed a statistical association with a lesser improvement with respect to right sided. Complications were associated with a lesser functional improvement (mRS, KPS, and clinical improvement: p = 0.001, p = 0.006, and p = 0.003, respectively). Hemorrhagic complications were associated with the worst functional prognosis.; Conclusions In our experience, factors associated with worse functional prognosis and quality of life were a poor preoperative performance status, female gender, operating on a recurrent lesion, involvement of the left corticospinal tract, and surgical or medical postoperative complications.

N2  -  Background: The simplistic approaches to language circuits are continuously challenged by new findings in brain structure and connectivity. The posterior middle frontal gyrus and area 55b (pFMG/area55b), in particular, has gained a renewed interest in the overall language network.
Methods: This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients who have undergone awake craniotomy for tumor resection. Navigated transcranial magnetic simulation (nTMS), tractography, and intraoperative findings were correlated with language outcomes.; Results: Sixty-five awake craniotomies were performed between 2012 and 2020, and 24 patients were included. nTMS elicited 42 positive responses, 76.2% in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and hesitation was the most common error (71.4%). In the pMFGarea55b, there were seven positive errors (five hesitations and two phonemic errors). This area had the highest positive predictive value (43.0%), negative predictive value (98.3%), sensitivity (50.0%), and specificity (99.0%) among all the frontal gyri. Intraoperatively, there were 33 cortical positive responses-two (6.0%) in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), 15 (45.5%) in the MFG, and 16 (48.5%) in the IFG. A total of 29 subcortical positive responses were elicited-21 in the deep IFG-MFG gyri and eight in the deep SFG-MFG gyri. The most common errors identified were speech arrest at the cortical level (20 responses-13 in the IFG and seven in the MFG) and anomia at the subcortical level (nine patients-eight in the deep IFG-MFG and one in the deep MFG-SFG). Moreover, 83.3% of patients had a transitory deterioration of language after surgery, mainly in the expressive component (p = 0.03). An increased number of gyri with intraoperative positive responses were related with better preoperative (p = 0.037) and worse postoperative (p = 0.029) outcomes. The involvement of the SFG-MFG subcortical area was related with worse language outcomes (p = 0.037). Positive nTMS mapping in the IFG was associated with a better preoperative language outcome (p = 0.017), relating to a better performance in the expressive component, while positive mapping in the MFG was related to a worse preoperative receptive component of language (p = 0.031).; Conclusion: This case series suggests that the posterior middle frontal gyrus, including area 55b, is an important integration cortical hub for both dorsal and ventral streams of language.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MS lesions exhibit varying degrees of axonal and myelin damage. A comprehensive description of lesion phenotypes could contribute to an improved radiologic evaluation of smoldering inflammation and remyelination processes. This study aimed to identify in vivo distinct MS lesion types using quantitative susceptibility mapping and susceptibility mapping?weighted imaging and to characterize them through T1-relaxometry, myelin mapping, and diffusion MR imaging. The spatial distribution of lesion phenotypes in relation to ventricular CSF was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MS lesions of 53 individuals were categorized into iso- or hypointense lesions, hyperintense lesions, and paramagnetic rim lesions, on the basis of their appearance on quantitative susceptibility mapping alone, according to published criteria, and with the additional support of susceptibility mapping?weighted imaging. Susceptibility values, T1-relaxation times, myelin and free water fractions, intracellular volume fraction, and the orientation dispersion index were compared among lesion phenotypes. The distance of the geometric center of each lesion from the ventricular CSF was calculated. RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-six MS lesions underwent the categorization process using quantitative susceptibility mapping and susceptibility mapping?weighted imaging. The novel use of susceptibility mapping?weighted images, which revealed additional microvasculature details, led us to re-allocate several lesions to different categories, resulting in a 35.6% decrease in the number of paramagnetic rim lesions, a 22.5% decrease in hyperintense lesions, and a 17.2% increase in iso- or hypointense lesions, with respect to the categorization based on quantitative susceptibility mapping only. The outcome of the categorization based on the joint use of quantitative susceptibility mapping and susceptibility mapping?weighted imaging was that 44.4% of lesions were iso- or hypointense lesions, 47.9% were hyperintense lesions, and 7.7% were paramagnetic rim lesions. A worsening gradient was observed from iso- or hypointense lesions to hyperintense lesions to paramagnetic rim lesions in T1-relaxation times, myelin water fraction, free water faction, and intracellular volume fraction. Paramagnetic rim lesions were located closer to ventricular CSF than iso- or hypointense lesions. The volume of hyperintense lesions was associated with a more severe disease course. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative susceptibility mapping and susceptibility mapping?weighted imaging allow in vivo classification of MS lesions into different phenotypes, characterized by different levels of axonal and myelin loss and spatial distribution. Hyperintense lesions and paramagnetic rim lesions, which have the most severe microstructural damage, were more often observed in the periventricular WM and were associated with a more severe disease course.

N2  -  Even if different dissection, tractographic and connectivity studies provided pure anatomical evidences about the optic radiations (ORs), descriptions of both the anatomical structure and the anatomo-functional relationships of the ORs with the adjacent bundles were not reported. We propose a detailed anatomical and functional study with post mortem' dissections and in vivo' direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the OR, demonstrating also the relationships with the adjacent eloquent bundles in a neurosurgical connectomic' perspective. Six human hemispheres (three left, three right) were dissected after a modified Klingler's preparation. The anatomy of the white matter was analysed according to systematic and topographical surgical perspectives. The anatomical results were correlated to the functional responses collected during three resections of tumours guided by cortico-subcortical DES during awake procedures. We identified two groups of fibres forming the OR. The superior component runs along the lateral wall of the occipital horn, the trigone and the supero-medial wall of the temporal horn. The inferior component covers inferiorly the occipital horn and the trigone, the lateral wall of the temporal horn and arches antero-medially to form the Meyer's Loop. The inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) covers completely the superior OR along its entire course, as confirmed by the subcortical DES. The inferior longitudinal fascicle runs in a postero-anterior and inferior direction, covering the superior OR posteriorly and the inferior OR anteriorly. The IFOF identification allows the preservation of the superior OR in the anterior temporal resection, avoiding post-operative complete hemianopia. The identification of the superior OR during the posterior temporal, inferior parietal and occipital resections leads to the preservation of the IFOF and of the eloquent functions it subserves. The accurate knowledge of the OR course and the relationships with the adjacent bundles is crucial to optimize quality of resection and functional outcome.

N2  -  The neural representation of language can be identified cortically using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and subcortically using the fiber tracking of diffusion tensor imaging. We investigated how cortical locations of language and language-eloquent white matter pathways differ in 40 brain lesion patients speaking various languages. Error rates related to stimulations at single sites in the frontal and parietal lobe differed significantly between Balto-Slavic and Indo-European languages. Error rates related to stimulations at single sites in the temporal lobe differed significantly between bilingual individuals. No differences were found in the white matter language pathway volumes between Balto-Slavic and Indo-European languages nor between bilingual patients. These original and exploratory data indicate that the underlying subcortical structure might be similar across languages, with initially observed differences in the cortical location of language depending on the semantic processing, but these could not be confirmed using detailed statistical analyses pointing at a similar cortical and subcortical network.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Advances in white matter tractography enhance neurosurgical planning and glioma resection, but white matter tractography is limited by biological variables such as edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration or selection biases related to regions of interest or fractional anisotropy values.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an automated tract identification paradigm that corrects for artifacts created by tumor edema and infiltration and provides a consistent, accurate method of fiber bundle identification.; METHODS: An automated tract identification paradigm was developed and evaluated for glioma surgery. A fiber bundle atlas was generated from 6 healthy participants. Fibers of a test set (including 3 healthy participants and 10 patients with brain tumors) were clustered adaptively with this atlas. Reliability of the identified tracts in both groups was assessed by comparison with 2 experts with the Cohen kappa used to quantify concurrence. We evaluated 6 major fiber bundles: cingulum bundle, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the last 3 tracts mediating language function.; RESULTS: The automated paradigm demonstrated a reliable and practical method to identify white mater tracts, despite mass effect, edema, and tract infiltration. When the tumor demonstrated significant mass effect or shift, the automated approach was useful for providing an initialization to guide the expert with identification of the specific tract of interest.; CONCLUSION: We report a reliable paradigm for the automated identification of white matter pathways in patients with gliomas. This approach should enhance the neurosurgical objective of maximal safe resections.; PU; PI; PA

N2  -  Objective: Unilateral asterixis has been reported in patients with thalamic lesion. This study aims at elucidating the pathophysiology of the thalamic asterixis.
Methods: Two cases with unilateral asterixis caused by an infarction in the lateral thalamus were studied by analysing the asterixis-related cortical activities, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for motor cortex excitability and probabilistic diffusion tractography for the thalamo-cortical connectivity.; Results: Averaging of electroencephalogram ( EEG) time-locked to the asterixis revealed rhythmic oscillations of a beta band at the central area contralateral to the affected hand. TMS revealed a decrease in the motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitude and a prolongation of the silent period (SP). The anatomical mapping of connections between the thalamus and cortical areas using a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) showed that the lateral thalamus involved by the infarction was connected to the premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the corresponding hemisphere.; Conclusions: The thalamic asterixis is mediated by the sensorimotor cortex, which is subjected to excessive inhibition as a result of the thalamic lesion involving the ventral lateral nucleus.; Significance: This is the first demonstration of participation of the sensorimotor cortex in the generation of asterixis due to the lateral thalamic lesion.

N2  -  Objective: Case series with C-11-PK11195 and positron emission tomography (PET) in stroke patients Suggest that activated microglia may be detected in remote brain regions with Fiber tract connections to the lesion site as all indicator of poststroke neuroinflammation. However, the specificity of these imaging findings remains to be demonstrated.
Methods: In a prospective controlled Study, we measured microglia activity using C-11-PK11195-PET along the pyramidal tract, as defined by diffusion censor imaging, in 21 patients with first-time acute subcortical ischemia within 2 weeks of stroke. Uptake ratios (affected VS unaffected side) were determined for a set of standardized Volumes of interest along the pyramidal tracts (PT). Uptake ratios from patients in whom the PT was affected were compared with those in whom the PT was not affected. Uptake ratios were related to motor deficit and lesion size according to correlation analyses.; Results: Increased uptake ratios were only found in patients in whom the PT was affected by stroke. In the affected hemisphere, uptake was increased at the level of pons, midbrain, and internal capsule, but not in the oval center. The extent of remote microglia activation was independent of infarct size or clinical measures of stroke severity.; Interpretation: A specific activation of microglia was only Found in patients in whom the PT was affected by the stroke and only caudal (anterograde) to the lesion; no activation was found in the retrograde direction or in those patients in whom the PT was not affected. These findings were independent of infarct size and may represent changes secondary to early Wallerian degeneration. Ann Neurol 2009;66:825-832

N2  -  BackgroundStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be an effective primary or adjuvant treatment option for intracranial tumors. However, it carries risks of various radiation toxicities, which can lead to functional deficits for the patients. Current inverse planning algorithms for SRS provide an efficient way for sparing organs at risk (OARs) by setting maximum radiation dose constraints in the treatment planning process. PurposeWe propose using activation maps from functional MRI (fMRI) to map the eloquent regions of the brain and define functional OARs (fOARs) for Gamma Knife SRS treatment planning. MethodsWe implemented a pipeline for analyzing patient fMRI data, generating fOARs from the resulting activation maps, and loading them onto the GammaPlan treatment planning software. We used the Lightning inverse planner to generate multiple treatment plans from open MRI data of five subjects, and evaluated the effects of incorporating the proposed fOARs. ResultsThe Lightning optimizer designs treatment plans with high conformity to the specified parameters. Setting maximum dose constraints on fOARs successfully limits the radiation dose incident on them, but can have a negative impact on treatment plan quality metrics. By masking out fOAR voxels surrounding the tumor target it is possible to achieve high quality treatment plans while controlling the radiation dose on fOARs. ConclusionsThe proposed method can effectively reduce the radiation dose incident on the eloquent brain areas during Gamma Knife SRS of brain tumors.

N2  -  Intraparenchymal cavities communicating with the ventricles may appear in patients with chronic obstructive hydrocephalus despite no identifiable surgerical, vascular or traumatic causes. The rate, features, pathogenesis, evolution and clinical impact of intraparenchymal diverticula have not been outlined, yet.
Brain MRIs of 130 patients (mean age: 11.3 years; age range: 0-67; 60 females) with chronic obstructive hydrocephalus were analyzed. The pathogenesis, neurosurgical treatment, ventricle size, signs of transependymal reabsorption and septum pellucidum integrity of the hydrocephalus were recorded. Subarachnoid outpouching of the ventricles, post-hemorrhagic parenchymal cavities, paths of ventricular shunting and cavities not communicating with the ventricles were excluded. Of patients with intraparenchymal diverticula, all previous available CT and MRI scans were evaluated.; Eight patients (6.2 %, mean age: 18.7 years; age range: 2-42) harbored 11 intraparenchymal diverticula sprouting from the temporal (6), occipital (3) or frontal (2) horns of the lateral ventricles. Intraparenchymal diverticula were more frequent in males (p = 0.04) and older patients (18.7 +- 12.7 vs 11.3 +- 9.8 years, p = 0.04). Their presence or evolution (mean neuroradiological follow-up 3.6 years; range: 0-8) showed a trend of association with hydrocephalus severity (bifrontal index) and did not correlate with the surgical treatment. In three patients the diverticula progressed during follow-up. One patient presented with hemiparesis consistent with the intraparenchymal lesion and improved after ventricular shunting. A DTI study revealed that the cortico-spinal tract was partly included in the septum between the ventricle and the intraparenchymal diverticulum.; Clinicians dealing with chronic severe obstructive hydrocephalus should be aware of ventricular intraparenchymal diverticulation. Studies aiming at clarifying their pathogenesis and proper management are warranted.

N2  -  Excitation of dorsal neck motoneurones evoked by electrical stimulation of primary trigeminal afferents in the Gasserian ganglion has been investigated with intracellular recording from alpha-motoneurones in the cat. Single stimulation in the Gasserian ganglion ipsi- and contralateral to the recording side evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in motoneurones innervating the lateral head flexor muscle splenius (SPL) and the head elevator muscles biventer cervicis and complexus (BCC). The gasserian EPSPs were composed of early and late components which gave the EPSPs a hump-like shape. A short train of stimuli, consisting of two to three volleys, evoked temporal facilitation of both the early and late EPSP components. The latencies of the gasserian EPSPs ranged from 1.6 to 3.6 ms in SPL motoneurones and from 1.6 to 5.8 ms among BCC motoneurones. A rather similar latency distribution between 1.6 and 2.4 ms was found for ipsi- and contralateral EPSPs in SPL and BCC motoneurones, which is compatible with a minimal disynaptic linkage between primary trigeminal afferents and neck motoneurones. Systematic transections of the ipsi- and contralateral trigeminal tracts were performed in the brain stem between 3 and 12 mm rostral to the level of obex. The results demonstrate that both the ipsi- and contralateral disynaptic and late gasserian EPSPs can be mediated via trigeminospinal neurones which take their origin in the nucleus trigeminalis spinalis oralis. Transection of the midline showed that the contralateral trigeminospinal neurones cross in the brain stem. Systematic tracking in and around the ipsilateral trigeminal nuclei demonstrated that the axons of ipsilateral trigeminospinal neurones descend just medial to and/or in the medial part of the nucleus. Spinal cord lesions revealed a location of the axons of the ipsilateral trigeminospinal neurones in the lateral and ventral funiculi. Interaction between the ipsi- and contralateral gasserian EPSPs showed complete summation of the disynaptic EPSP component, while the late components were occluded by about 45%. These results show that the disynaptic EPSPs are mediated by separate trigeminospinal neurones from the ipsi- and contralateral side, while about half of the late EPSPs are mediated by common neurones which receive strong bilateral excitation from commissural neurones in the trigeminal nuclei. Spatial facilitation was found in the late gasserian EPSP but not in the disynaptic gasserian EPSP by conditioning stimulation of cortico- and tectofugal fibres. Disynaptic pyramidal and tectal EPSPs, which are mediated by reticulospinal neurones, were facilitated by a single stimulation in the gasserian ganglion at an optimal interval of 2 ms. It is suggested that primary trigeminal afferents can excite the reticulospinal neurones via a disynaptic trigeminoreticular pathway.

N2  -  Repetitive monopolar short-train stimulation (STS) delivered from a suction probe enables continuous mapping and distance assessment of corticospinal tracts during asleep glioma resection. In this study, we explored this stimulation technique in awake glioma surgery. Fourteen patients with glioma involving language-related tracts were prospectively included. Continuous (3-Hz) cathodal monopolar STS (five pulses, 250 Hz) was delivered via the tip of a suction probe throughout tumor resection while testing language performance. At 70 subcortical locations, surgery was paused to deliver STS in a steady suction probe position. Monopolar STS influence on language performance at different subcortical locations was separated into three groups. Group 1 represented locations where STS did not produce language disturbance. Groups 2 and 3 represented subcortical locations where STS produced language interference at different threshold intensities (>= 7.5 and <= 5 mA, respectively). For validation, bipolar Penfield stimulation (PS; 60 Hz for 3 s) was used as a "gold standard" comparison method to detect close proximity to language-related tracts and classified as positive or negative regarding language interference. There was no language interference from STS in 28 locations (Group 1), and PS was negative for all sites. In Group 2 (STS threshold >= 7.5 mA; median, 10 mA), there was language interference at 18 locations, and PS (median, 4 mA) was positive in only one location. In Group 3 (STS threshold <= 5 mA; median, 5 mA), there was language interference at 24 locations, and positive PS (median 4 mA) was significantly (p < 0.01) more common (15 out of 24 locations) compared with Groups 1 and 2. Despite the continuous stimulation throughout tumor resection, there were no seizures in any of the patients. In five patients, temporary current spread to the facial nerve was observed. We conclude that continuous subcortical STS is feasibly also in awake glioma surgery and that no language interference from STS or interference at >= 7.5 mA seems to indicate safe distance to language tracts as judged by PS comparisons. STS language interference at STS <= 5 mA was not consistently confirmed by PS, which needs to be addressed.

N2  -  By combining the expertise of clinical neuroscience, the aim of neuro-oncology is to optimize diagnostic planning and therapy of primary brain tumors in an interdisciplinary setting together with radio-oncology and medical oncology. High-end imaging frequently allows brain tumors to be diagnosed preoperatively with respect to tumor entity and even tumor malignancy grade. Moreover, neuroimaging is indispensable for guidance of biopsy resection and monitoring of therapy. Surgical resection of intracranial lesions with preservation of neurological function has become dramatically more extensive. Tools to achieve this goal are, for example neuronavigation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), tractography, intraoperative cortical stimulation and precise intraoperative definition of tumor margins by virtue of various techniques. In addition to classical histopathological diagnosis and tumor classification, modern neuropathology is supplemented by molecular characterization of brain tumors in order to provide clinicians with prognostic and predictive (of therapy) markers, such as codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q in anaplastic gliomas and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastomas. Although this is not yet individualized tumor therapy, the increasingly more detailed analysis of the molecular pathogenesis of an individual glioma will eventually lead to specific pharmacological blockade of disturbed intracellular pathways in individual patients. This article gives an overview of the state of the art of interdisciplinary neuro-oncology whereby part 1 deals with the diagnostics and surgical therapy of primary brain tumors and part 2 describes the medical therapy of primary brain tumors.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Immune response to cancer therapy may result in pseudoprogression, which can only be identified retrospectively and may disrupt an effective therapy. This study assesses whether serial parametric response mapping (a voxel-by-voxel method of image analysis also known as functional diffusion mapping) analysis of ADC measurements following peptide-based vaccination may help prospectively distinguish progression from pseudoprogression in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, 21 children, 4-18 years of age, with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas were enrolled in a serial peptide-based vaccination protocol following radiation therapy. DWI was acquired before immunotherapy and at 6-week intervals during vaccine treatment. Pseudoprogression was identified retrospectively on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings, excluding DWI. Parametric response mapping was used to analyze 96 scans, comparing ADC measures at multiple time points (from the first vaccine to up to 12 weeks after the vaccine was halted) with prevaccine baseline values: Log-transformed fractional increased ADC, fractional decreased ADC, and parametric response mapping ratio (fractional increased ADCfractional decreased ADC) were compared between patients with and without pseudoprogression, by using generalized estimating equations with inverse weighting by cluster size.; RESULTS: Median survival was 13.1 months from diagnosis (range, 6.4-24.9 months). Four of 21 children (19%) were assessed as experiencing pseudoprogression. Patients with pseudoprogression had higher fitted average log-transformed parametric response mapping ratios (P =.01) and fractional decreased ADCs (P =.0004), compared with patients without pseudoprogression.; CONCLUSIONS: Serial parametric response mapping of ADC, performed at multiple time points of therapy, may distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas treated with peptide-based vaccination.

N2  -  Purpose
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a voxel-wise analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may differentiate between progressive disease (PD) and pseudoprogression (PsP) in patients with high-grade glioma using the parametric response map, a newly introduced postprocessing tool.; Methods; Twenty-eight patients with proven PD and seven patients with PsP were identified in this retrospective feasibility study. For all patients ADC baseline and follow-up maps on four subsequent MRIs were available. ADC maps were coregistered on contrast enhanced T1-weighted follow-up images. Subsequently, enhancement in the follow-up contrast enhanced T1-weighted image was manually delineated and a reference region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the contralateral white matter. Both ROIs were transferred to the ADC images. Relative ADC (rADC) (baseline)reference ROI values and rADC (follow up)reference ROI values were calculated for each voxel within the ROI. The corresponding voxels of rADC (follow up) and rADC (baseline) were subtracted and the percentage of all voxels within the ROI that exceeded the threshold of 0.25 was quantified.; Results; rADC voxels showed a decrease of 59.2% (1 st quartile (Q1) 36.7; 3rd quartile (Q3) 78.6) above 0.25 in patients with PD and 18.6% (Q1 3.04; Q3 26.5) in patients with PsP (p = 0.005). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the optimal decreasing rADC cut-off value for identifying PD of > 27.05% (area under the curve 0.844 +- 0.065, sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.86, p = 0.014).; Conclusion; This feasibility study shows that the assessment of rADC using parametric response maps might be a promising approach to contribute to the differentiation between PD and PsP. Further research in larger patient cohorts is necessary to finally determine its clinical utility.

N2  -  Background: The dorsal premotor area (DPM) plays an important role in hand coordination and muscle recruitment for lifting activities. Lesions in the area have demonstrated that the DPM is critical in the integration of movements that require combinations of reaching, grasping, and lifting. While many have looked at its functional connectivity, few studies have shown the full anatomical connectivity of DPM including its connections beyond the motor network. Using region-based fMRI studies, we built a neuroanatomical model to account for these extra-motor connections.
Objective: In this study, we performed meta-analysis and tractography with the goal of creating a map of the dorsal premotor network using the Human Connectome Project parcellation scheme nomenclature (i.e. the Glasser Atlas). While there are other possible ways to map this, we feel that it is critical that neuroimaging begin to move towards all of its data expressed in a single nomenclature which can be compared across studies, and a potential framework that we can build upon in future studies.; Methods: Thirty region-based fMRI studies were used to generate an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) using BrainMap software (Research Imaging Institute of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio). Cortical parcellations overlapping the ALE were used to construct a preliminary model of the Dorsal Premotor Area. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) based tractography was performed to determine the connectivity between cortical parcellations and connections throughout cortex. The resulting connectivities were described using the cortical parcellation scheme developed by the Human Connectome Project (HCP).; Results: Three left hemisphere regions were found to comprise the Dorsal Premotor Area. These included areas 6a, 6d. and 6v, Across mapped brains, these areas showed consistent interconnections between each other. Additionally, ipsilateral connections to the premotor cortex, sensorimotor cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobule, middle and inferior frontal gyrus, and insula were demonstrated. Connections to the contralateral supplementary motor area and premotor cortex were also identified.; Conclusions: We describe a preliminary cortical model for the underlying structural connectivity of the Dorsal Premotor Area. Future studies should further characterize the neuroanatomic underpinnings of this network.

N2  -  Objective: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess the pattern of regional gray matter ( GM) loss in patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis ( MS) and its relation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, disease duration, and the extent of T2 lesion load ( LL).
Methods: From 28 patients with pediatric relapsing-remitting MS ( 16 girls; mean age = 14.4 years, range = 7 to 16 years) and 21 matched controls, dual-echo and three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequences were acquired. T2 LL was measured using a local thresholding segmentation technique. Data were analyzed using an optimized VBM analysis and statistical parametric mapping.; Results: In pediatric patients with MS, mean brain T2 LL was 7.8 mL +- 11.3. Intracranial volume did not differ between patients and controls. Compared to controls, patients with pediatric MS had significant GM loss in the thalamus, bilaterally, which was significantly correlated with T2 LL ( r = -0.80 for the right thalamus, r = -0.74 for the left thalamus, p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). No correlation was found between thalamic GM loss, disease duration, and disability.; Conclusions: In patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis ( MS), differently from what happens in adult-onset MS, gray matter ( GM) atrophy seems to involve the thalamus only, with sparing of the cortex and other deep GM nuclei. The correlation found between atrophy and T2 lesion load suggests transsynaptic and Wallerian degenerations as the most likely substrate of tissue loss in the thalamus of these patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which has been recently defined as a distinct entity in the 2016 World Health Organization classification, may exhibit aggressive clinical behavior and relatively worse prognosis than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. This study aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in MR imaging characteristics between these 2 tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:This retrospective study included 9 patients with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and 10 patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma who underwent MR imaging before an operation. DWI was performed in 17 patients (8 with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, 9 with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma); and DSC-PWI, in 9 patients (5 with anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, 4 with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma). Demographics, conventional imaging characteristics (location, size, cystic degeneration, enhancement, peritumoral edema, and leptomeningeal contact), minimum relative ADC ratio, and maximum relative CBV ratio were evaluated between the anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma groups. RESULTS:Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma was more likely to demonstrate high-grade features than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, including greater maximum tumor diameter (4.7 0.6 cm versus 3.1 +/- 1.1 cm, P = .001), more frequent heterogeneous contrast enhancement of solid portions (88.9% versus 20.0%, P = .01), more obvious peritumoral edema (2.3 +/- 0.9 cm versus 1.0 +/- 0.9 cm, P = .008), lower minimum relative ADC on DWI (1.0 +/- 0.2 versus 1.5 +/- 0.4, P = .008), and higher maximum relative CBV on DSC-PWI (2.6 +/- 0.8 versus 1.6 +/- 0.2, P = .036). CONCLUSIONS:Anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas often have more aggressive MR imaging features mimicking high-grade astrocytomas than pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas. DWI and DSC-PWI might be useful in the characterization and differentiation of anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Planum sphenoidale (PS) and tuberculum sellae (TS) meningiomas cause visual symptoms due to compression of the optic chiasm. The treatment of choice is surgical removal with the goal of improving vision and achieving complete tumor removal. Two options exist to remove these tumors: the transcranial approach (TCA) and the endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA). Significant controversy exists regarding which approach provides the best results and whether there is a subset of patients for whom an EEA may be more suitable. Comparisons using a similar cohort of patients, namely, those suitable for gross-total resection with EEA, are lacking from the literature.
METHODS The authors reviewed all cases of PS and TS meningiomas that were surgically removed at Weill Cornell Medical College between 2000 and 2015 (TCA) and 2008 and 2015 (EEA). All cases were shown to a panel of 3 neurosurgeons to find only those tumors that could be removed equally well either through an EEA or TCA to standardize both groups. Volumetric measurements of preoperative and postoperative tumor size, FLAIR images, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were assessed by 2 independent reviewers and compared to assess extent of resection and trauma to the surrounding brain. Visual outcome and complications were also compared.; RESULTS Thirty-two patients were identified who underwent either EEA (n = 17) or TCA (n = 15). The preoperative tumor size was comparable (mean 5.58 +- 3.42 vs 5.04 +- 3.38 cm3 +- SD, p = 0.661). The average extent of resection achieved was not significantly different between the 2 groups (98.80% +- 3.32% vs 95.13% +- 11.69%, p = 0.206). Postoperatively, the TCA group demonstrated a significant increase in the FLAIRedema signal compared with EEA patients (4.15 +- 7.10 vs -0.69 +- 2.73 cm3, p = 0.014). In addition, the postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging signal of cytotoxic ischemic damage was significantly higher in the TCA group than in the EEA group (1.88 +- 1.96 vs 0.40 +- 0.55 cm3, p = 0.008). Overall, significantly more EEA patients experienced improved or stable visual outcomes compared with TCA patients (93% vs 56%, p = 0.049). Visual deterioration was greater after TCA than EEA (44% vs 0%, p = 0.012). While more patients experienced postoperative seizures after TCA than after EEA (27% vs 0%, p = 0.038), there was a trend toward more CSF leakage and anosmia after EEA than after TCA (11.8% vs 0%, p = 0.486 and 11.8% vs 0%, p = 0.118, respectively).; CONCLUSIONS In this small single-institution study of similarly sized and located PS and TS meningiomas, EEA provided equivalent rates of resection with better visual results, less trauma to the brain, and fewer seizures. These preliminary results merit further investigation in a larger multiinstitutional study and may support EEA resection by experienced surgeons in a subset of carefully selected PS and TS meningiomas.

N2  -  Despite the lack of class I evidence, it is widely agreed that surgery can improve the functional and vital prognosis for WHO grade II gliomas when the resection is at least subtotal radiologically, that is, leaving less than 10 cm 3 of visible residual tumor. Because these tumors frequently invade functional areas, the preoperative estimation of the probable residual volume remains challenging. This article presents a probabilistic map of postoperative residues, with the aim of predicting before the decision for surgical intervention whether the resection could be subtotal. We selected 65 patients who underwent surgery with intraoperative functional mapping between 1999 and 2004 for a WHO grade II glioma located in a sensorimotor and/or language area. For each case, the postoperative image was normalized on a standard atlas, and the residual tumor was segmented. A probabilistic map of residues was then computed. The fusion between the map and a preoperative image allowed a preoperative estimation of the expected extent of resection. The map enhances the regions where grade II glioma cannot be resected. The success rate for the preoperative classification of partial versus subtotal resection is 82%. Although both its reliability and accuracy have to be improved, this probabilistic map gives preoperatively an objective estimation of the expected extent of resection for grade II glioma resected under intraoperative functional mapping. This rationale will assist in decisions regarding surgical resection and may thus contribute to the elaboration of a therapeutic consensus for WHO grade II glioma.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Abscess coexisting within a brain tumor is rare. Case reports in the literature primarily consist of sellar pathology and parenchymal lesions, including meningioma, glioma, and metastases. We report a case of glioblastoma with an intratumoral abscess in a middle-aged patient with no prior invasive procedure or systemic focus of infection.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old woman presented with new-onset generalized seizures and rapidly progressive left hemiparesis. Imaging showed a right frontal necrotic lesion with a peripherally enhancing wall and solid component posteriorly. There was no diffusion restriction within the lesion. She was afebrile, and there was no systemic focus of infection. With provisional diagnosis of malignant glioma, she underwent surgical resection of the lesion. A differential diagnosis of abscess was considered preoperatively because of the rapid increase in size of the lesion. At surgery, there was a pus-filled cavity with a few areas of grayish, soft, flimsy wall and thrombosed veins. This raised a strong suspicion of a coexisting abscess within a malignant glioma, which was confirmed by histopathologic and microbiologic examination.; CONCLUSIONS: It is important for neurosurgeons to be aware of this rare entity. The treatment protocol remains controversial and is primarily guided by expert opinion. It is important to aggressively treat the patient with antibiotics followed by adjuvant therapy for malignancy. The timing and administration of adjuvant therapy are unclear. We suggest a delay of chemotherapy until at least 4 weeks of therapy with sensitive antibiotics.

N2  -  White matter bundles linking gray matter nodes are key anatomical players to fully characterize associations between brain systems and cognitive functions. Here we used a multivariate lesion inference approach grounded in coalitional game theory (multiperturbation Shapley value analysis, MSA) to infer causal contributions of white matter bundles to visuospatial orienting of attention. Our work is based on the characterization of the lesion patterns of 25 right hemisphere stroke patients and the causal analysis of their impact on three neuropsychological tasks: line bisection, letter cancellation, and bells cancellation. We report that, out of the 11 white matter bundles included in our MSA coalitions, the optic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the anterior cingulum were the only tracts to display task-invariant contributions (positive, positive, and negative, respectively) to the tasks. We also report task-dependent influences for the branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the posterior cingulum. By extending prior findings to white matter tracts linking key gray matter nodes, we further characterize from a network perspective the anatomical basis of visual and attentional orienting processes. The knowledge about interactions patterns mediated by white matter tracts linking cortical nodes of attention orienting networks, consolidated by further studies, may help develop and customize brain stimulation approaches for the rehabilitation of visuospatial neglect.

N2  -  By combining the expertise of clinical neuroscience, the aim of neuro-oncology is to optimize diagnostic planning and therapy of primary brain tumors in an interdisciplinary setting together with radio-oncology and medical oncology. High-end imaging frequently allows brain tumors to be diagnosed preoperatively with respect to tumor entity and even tumor malignancy grade. Moreover, neuroimaging is indispensable for guidance of biopsy resection and monitoring of therapy. Surgical resection of intracranial lesions with preservation of neurological function is increasingly feasible. Tools to achieve this goal are, for example neuronavigation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), tractography, intraoperative cortical stimulation and precise intraoperative definition of tumor margins by virtue of various techniques. In addition to classical histopathological diagnosis and tumor classification, modern neuropathology is supplemented by molecular characterization of brain tumors in order to provide clinicians with prognostic and predictive (of therapy) markers, such as codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q in anaplastic gliomas and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastomas. Although this is not yet individualized tumor therapy, the increasingly more detailed analysis of the molecular pathogenesis of an individual glioma will eventually lead to specific pharmacological blockade of disturbed intracellular pathways in individual patients. This article gives an overview of the state of the art of interdisciplinary neuro-oncology whereby part 1 deals with the diagnostics and surgical therapy of primary brain tumors and part 2 describes the medical therapy of primary brain tumors.

N2  -  Different treatment interventions induce distinct remodelling of network architecture of entire motor system. Acupuncture has been proved to be of a promising efficacy in motor recovery. However, it is still unclear whether the reorganization of motor-related brain network underlying acupuncture is related with time since stroke and severity of deficit at baseline. The aim of study was to characterize the relation between motor-related brain organization following acupuncture and white matter microstructural changes at an interval of two weeks. We demonstrated that acupuncture induced differential reorganization of motor-related network for stroke patients as time-lapse since stroke. At the baseline, acupuncture can induce the increased functional connectivity between the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the right M1, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), thalamus, and cerebellum. After two-week recovery, the increased functional connectivity of the left M1 was more widely distributed and primarily located in the insula, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and SMA. Furthermore, a significant negative relation existed between the FA value in the left M1 at the baseline scanning and node centrality of this region following acupuncture for both baseline and two-week recovery. Our findings may shed a new insight on understanding the reorganization of motor-related theory underlying motor impairments after brain lesions in stroke patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is early evidence that diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is useful in demonstrating subtle white matter alterations in different diseases of brain. We hypothesize that DTI in several brain regions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients is useful in the early detection of HIV-related brain injury.
METHODS: MR imaging and DTI were performed in 60 HIV+ patients and in 30 controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; mms(2)) maps were generated and coregistered on T2-weighted images. Regions of interest were placed in the splenium and germ of the callosum, the frontal white matter, and the hippocampus. HIV+ patients were divided into those whose CD4 count were < 250 cellsmm(3) or > 250 cellsmm(3). According to plasma viral loads, patients were divided into those whose viral loads were < 50 copiesmL, 50-100,000 copiesmL, or > 100,000 copiesmL.; RESULTS: Statistically significant decrease of FA was found in the genu of the corpus callosum in HIV+ patients compared with controls. FA was reduced in the frontal white matter and hippocampi in HIV+ patients compared with controls. Differences, however, were not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences were found between the HIV+ groups for FA of the splenium or between these groups and the controls. ADC values were significantly increased in the germ of HIV+ patients when compared with controls and were also increased in other locations, but without statistical significance.; CONCLUSION. As used in this study, DTI was not helpful in identifying patients with early HIV infection.

N2  -  Interventional MR imaging has proved to be superior to traditional stereotaxy for brain tumor resection. Additionally, high-field strength interventional systems possess diagnostic capabilities that are unavailable in these low-field strength systems: MR angiography, MR venography, functional studies, spectroscopy, and diffusion-weighted imaging. The dual interventional and diagnostic capabilities of high-field strength systems not only create more efficient use of this technology, but also allow for extensive pre- and intra-operative planning for brain tumor resection. With appropriate adjustments to the surgical environment and equipment, high-field strength MR-guided procedures have been safe to date.

N2  -  General cognitive ability, or general intelligence (g), is central to cognitive science, yet the processes that constitute it remain unknown, in good part because most prior work has relied on correlational methods. Large-scale behavioral and neuroanatomical data from neurologic patients with focal brain lesions can be leveraged to advance our understanding of the key mechanisms of g, as this approach allows inference on the independence of cognitive processes along with elucidation of their respective neuroanatomical substrates. We analyzed behavioral and neuroanatomical data from 402 humans (212 males; 190 females) with chronic, focal brain lesions. Structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated a psychometric isomorphism between g and working memory in our sample (which we refer to as g/Gwm), but not between g and other cognitive abilities. Multivariate lesion-behavior mapping analyses indi-cated that g and working memory localize most critically to a site of converging white matter tracts deep to the left temporo-parietal junction. Tractography analyses demonstrated that the regions in the lesion-behavior map of g/Gwm were primarily associated with the arcuate fasciculus. The anatomic findings were validated in an independent cohort of acute stroke patients (n =101) using model based predictions of cognitive deficits generated from the Iowa cohort lesion-behavior maps. The neuroanatomical localization of g/ Gwm provided the strongest prediction of observed g in the new cohort (r = 0.42, p , 0.001), supporting the anatomic specificity of our findings. These results provide converging behavioral and anatomic evidence that working memory is a key mechanism contributing to domain-general cognition.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary CNS neoplasm with poor overall survival (OS) despite standard of care. On MRI, GBM is usually characterized by an enhancing portion (CET) (surgery target) and a nonenhancing surrounding (NET). Extent of resection is a long debated issue in GBM, with recent evidence suggesting that both CET and NET should be resected in <65 years old patients, regardless of other risk factors (i.e., molecular biomarkers). Our aim was to test a radiomic model for patient survival stratification in <65 years old patients, by analyzing MRI features of NET, to aid tumor resection. Methods Sixty-eight <65 years old GBM patients, with extensive CET resection, were selected. Resection was evaluated by manually segmenting CET on volumetric T1-weighted MRI pre and postsurgery (within 72 h). All patients underwent the same treatment protocol including chemoradiation. NET radiomic features were extracted with a custom version of Pyradiomics. Feature selection was performed with principal component analysis (PCA) and its effect on survival tested with Cox regression model. Twelve months OS discrimination was tested by t-test followed by logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p Five PCA components (PC1-5) explained 90% of the variance. PC5 resulted significant in the Cox model (p = 0.002; exp(B) = 0.686), at t-test (p = 0.002) and logistic regression analysis (p = 0.006). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based features were the most significant for patient survival stratification. Conclusions ADC radiomic features on NET predict survival after standard therapy and could be used to improve patient selection for more extensive surgery.

N2  -  Introduction:Typing on a keyboard requires complex collaboration between visuospatial/procedural memory, language, and motor function. The impaired ability to type, independent of motor deficits, apraxia, or aphasia has been coined "dystypia."
Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman with a history of blepharospasm, oromandibular, and segmental dystonia underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of a waning response to botulinum toxin therapy. Following DBS, she discovered she no longer "remembered" how to type fluidly and had to "hunt and peck" for letters on the keyboard. This issue persisted at a 2-year follow-up. The patient underwent serial typing tests with the DBS ON vs. OFF. Post-operative lead reconstruction was performed using Lead-DBS. The volume of tissue activation (VTA) modeling was combined with whole-brain tractography.; Results: Typing improved when the device was switched to the DBS OFF state. Cortical mapping revealed strong modulation of the right angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure, and left cuneus. There was also activation of bilateral supplemental motor areas and superior parietal gyri.; Discussion: Shared lesion topography analysis of dystypia cases in the literature has suggested the involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The SLF involves the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and arcuate fasciculus. Our patient's connectivity pattern suggested SLF involvement. The improvement in OFF state typing and her imaging together suggested that the dystypia in her case was a stimulation-induced side effect.; Conclusion: Dystypia is a rare side effect of Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) DBS therapy and may be associated with SLF involvement.

N2  -  It has been proposed that not completely overlapping brain networks support interval timing depending on whether or not an external, predictable temporal cue is provided during the task, aiding time estimation. Here we tested this hypothesis in a neuropsychological study, using both a topological approach - through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), that assesses the relation between continuous behavioral scores and lesion information on a voxel-by-voxel basis - and a hodological approach, using an atlas-based tractography. A group of patients with unilateral focal brain lesions and their matched controls performed a duration reproduction task assessing time processing in two conditions, namely with regularly spaced stimuli during encoding and reproduction (Regular condition), and with irregularly spaced stimuli during the same task (Irregular condition). VLSM analyses showed that scores in the two conditions were associated with lesions involving partly separable clusters of voxels, with lower performance only in the Irregular condition being related to lesions involving the right insular cortex. Performance in both conditions correlated with the probability of disconnection of the right frontal superior longitudinal tract, and of the superior and middle branches of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. These findings suggest that the dissociation between timing in regular and irregular contexts is not complete, since performance in both conditions relies on the integrity of a common suprasecond timing network. Furthermore, they are consistent with the hypothesis that tracking time without the aid of external cues selectively relies on the integration of psychophysiological changes in the right insula.

N2  -  The El (epileptic) mouse is considered a model for complex partial seizures in humans.  Seizures in El mice begin around 7-8 weeks of age and persist throughout life.  To determine if astrocytic gliosis was present in adult seizing El mice, the distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was studied in the hippocampus using an antibody to GFAP.  The mean number of GFAP-positive cells per square milli-meter of hippocampus was approximately 15- to 40-fold higher in adult El mice than in nonseizing control C57BL/6J (B6) mice or in young nonseizing El mice.  Relative GFAP concentration (expressed per milligram of total tissue protein) in hippocampus and cerebellum was estimated by densitometric scanning of peroxidase-stained western blots.  GFAP concentration was 2.7-fold greater in hippocampus of adult seizing El mice than in the control B6 mice.  No differences in GFAP content were detected between the strains in the cerebellum.  Because gangliosides can serve as cell surface markers for changes in neuronal cytoarchitecture, they were analyzed to determine if the gliotic response in El mice was associated with changes in neural composition.  Although the total ganglioside concentration of hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum was similar in adult El and control B6 mice, a synaptic membrane enriched ganglioside, GD1a, was elevated in the adult El cerebral cortex and hippocampus.  The findings indicate that El mice express a type of gliosis that is not accompanied by obvious neuronal loss.

N2  -  Objective: Tractography has been used to define the presurgical location of white matter tracts, but this is subjective and time-intensive, making incorporation to imaging workflow at scale problematic. The objective is to validate a fully automated pipeline using the TractSeg algorithm (Wasserthal et al. NeuroImage 2018;183:239-253) to segment the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to the corticospinal tract. Methods: The process of importing a structural MPRAGE sequence and raw diffusion weighted images from PACS, executing the TractSeg algorithm, overlaying the resulting bilateral corticospinal tracts on the MPRAGE image, and exporting this composite image to PACS was automated. This procedure was used to segment the corticospinal tract in 28 patients with brain masses adjacent to or displacing the corticospinal tract. These segmentations were compared with both manual deterministic tractography performed with DSI Studio using seeds placed in the pons and an automated tractography method in DSI Studio. Results: The automated algorithm was able to segment the bilateral corticospinal tracts in all 28 patients whereas the manual reference method and DSI Studio based automated tractography were unsuccessful in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In all cases, the TractSeg segmentations very closely matched the manual segmentations. Also, TractSeg appeared to include larger portions of the lateral corticospinal tract fibers than the other 2 methods. Conclusion: The TractSeg algorithm demonstrated robust performance in segmenting the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to this tract. The algorithm is fast to perform and has great potential for optimizing and streamlining neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  Modern neuroscience agrees that neurological processing emerges from the multimodal interaction among multiple cortical and subcortical neuronal hubs, connected at short and long distance by white matter, to form a largely integrated and dynamic network, called the brain "connectome." The final architecture of these circuits results from a complex, continuous, and highly protracted development process of several axonal pathways that constitute the anatomical substrate of neuronal interactions. Awareness of the network organization of the central nervous system is crucial not only to understand the basis of children's neurological development, but also it may be of special interest to improve the quality of neurosurgical treatments of many pediatric diseases. Although there are a flourishing number of neuroimaging studies of the connectome, a comprehensive vision linking this research to neurosurgical practice is still lacking in the current pediatric literature. The goal of this review is to contribute to bridging this gap. In the first part, we summarize the main current knowledge concerning brain network maturation and its involvement in different aspects of normal neurocognitive development as well as in the pathophysiology of specific diseases. The final section is devoted to identifying possible implications of this knowledge in the neurosurgical field, especially in epilepsy and tumor surgery, and to discuss promising perspectives for future investigations.

N2  -  A key aspect of cognitive control is the management of conflicting incoming information to achieve a goal, termed 'interference control'. Although the role of the right frontal lobe in interference control is evident, the white matter tracts subserving this cognitive process remain unclear. To investigate this, we studied the effect of transient network disruption (by means of direct electrical stimulation) and permanent disconnection (resulting from neurosurgical resection) on interference control processes, using the Stroop test in the intraoperative and extraoperative neurosurgical setting. We evaluated the sites at which errors could be produced by direct electrical stimulation during an intraoperative Stroop test in 34 patients with frontal right hemisphere glioma. Lesion-symptom mapping was used to evaluate the relationship between the resection cavities and postoperative performance on the Stroop test of this group compared with an additional 29 control patients who did not perform the intraoperative test (63 patients in total aged 17-77 years; 28 female). We then examined tract disruption and disconnection in a subset of eight patients who underwent both the intraoperative Stroop test and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography. The results showed that, intraoperatively, the majority of sites associated with errors during Stroop test performance and concurrent subcortical stimulation clustered in a region of white matter medial to the right inferior frontal gyrus, lateral and superior to the striatum. Patients who underwent the intraoperative test maintained cognitive control ability at the 1-month follow-up (P = 0.003). Lesion-symptom analysis showed resection of the right inferior frontal gyrus was associated with slower postoperative Stroop test ability (corrected for multiple comparisons, 5000 permutations). The stimulation sites associated with intraoperative errors most commonly corresponded with the inferior fronto-striatal tracts and anterior thalamic radiation (over 75% of patients), although the latter was commonly resected without postoperative deficits on the Stroop test (in 60% of patients). Our results show converging evidence to support a critical role for the inferior frontal gyrus in interference control processes. The intraoperative data combined with tractography suggests that cortico-subcortical tracts, over cortico-cortical connections, may be vital in maintaining efficiency of cognitive control processes. This suggests the importance of their preservation during resection of right frontal tumours.

N2  -  MR imaging criteria for diagnosing acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) have not been clearly established. Due to the wide spectrum of differential considerations, new imaging features allowing early and accurate diagnosis for ADEM are needed. We hypothesized that ADEM lesions would be characterized by vasogenic edema due to the potential reversibility of the disease.
Sixteen patients who met the diagnostic criteria for ADEM proposed by the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) and had complete MR imaging studies performed at our institution during the acute phase of the disease were identified retrospectively and evaluated by experienced pediatric neuroradiologists.; Vasogenic edema was demonstrated on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in 12 out of 16 patients; cytotoxic edema was identified in two patients while the other two patients displayed no changes on DWIADC. ADC values for lesions and normal-appearing brain tissue were 1.39 +- 0.45 x 10(-3) and 0.81 +- 0.09 x 10(-3) mms(2), respectively (p = 0.002). When considering a cutoff of 5 days between acute and subacute disease, no difference between ADC values in acute vs. subacute phase was depicted. However, we found a significant correlation and an inverse and significant relationship between time and ADC value.; We propose that vasogenic edema is a reliable diagnostic sign of acute neuroinflammation in ADEM.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Increased cellular density is a hallmark of gliomas, both in the bulk of the tumor and in areas of tumor infiltration into surrounding brain. Altered cellular density causes altered imaging findings, but the degree to which cellular density can be quantitatively estimated from imaging is unknown. The purpose of this study was to discover the best MR imaging and processing techniques to make quantitative and spatially specific estimates of cellular density.; MATERIALS AND METHODS:; We collected stereotactic biopsies in a prospective imaging clinical trial targeting untreated patients with gliomas at our institution undergoing their first resection. The data included preoperative MR imaging with conventional anatomic, diffusion, perfusion, and permeability sequences and quantitative histopathology on biopsy samples. We then used multiple machine learning methodologies to estimate cellular density using local intensity information from the MR images and quantitative cellular density measurements at the biopsy coordinates as the criterion standard.; RESULTS:; The random forest methodology estimated cellular density with R-2 = 0.59 between predicted and observed values using 4 input imaging sequences chosen from our full set of imaging data (T2, fractional anisotropy, CBF, and area under the curve from permeability imaging). Limiting input to conventional MR images (T1 pre- and postcontrast, T2, and FLAIR) yielded slightly degraded performance (R-2 = 0.52). Outputs were also reported as graphic maps.; CONCLUSIONS:; Cellular density can be estimated with moderate-to-strong correlations using MR imaging inputs. The random forest machine learning model provided the best estimates. These spatially specific estimates of cellular density will likely be useful in guiding both diagnosis and treatment.

N2  -  Neural foundations underlying visual agnosia are poorly understood. The authors present the case of a patient who underwent awake surgery for a right basal temporooccipital low-grade glioma in which direct electrostimulation was used both at the cortical and subcortical level. Brain mapping over the inferior longitudinal fascicle generated contralateral visual hemiagnosia. These original findings are in agreement with recent tractography data that have confirmed the existence of an occipitotemporal pathway connecting occipital visual input to higher-level processing in temporal lobe structures. This is the first report of a true transient visual hemiagnosia elicited through electrostimulation, supporting the crucial role of inferior longitudinal fascicle in visual recognition.

N2  -  Objectives
To explore in vivo innate immune cell activation as a function of the distance from ventricular CSF in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using F-18-DPA714 PET and to investigate its relationship with periventricular microstructural damage, evaluated by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and with trajectories of disability worsening.; Methods; Thirty-seven patients with MS and 19 healthy controls underwent MRI and F-18-DPA714 TSPO dynamic PET, from which individual maps of voxels characterized by innate immune cell activation (DPA+) were generated. White matter (WM) was divided in 3-mm-thick concentric rings radiating from the ventricular surface toward the cortex, and the percentage of DPA+ voxels and mean MTR were extracted from each ring. Two-year trajectories of disability worsening were collected to identify patients with and without recent disability worsening.; Results; The percentage of DPA+ voxels was higher in patients compared to controls in the periventricularWM(p = 6.10e-6) and declined with increasing distance from ventricular surface, with a steeper gradient in patients compared to controls (p = 0.001). This gradient was found in both periventricular lesions and normal-appearing WM. In the total WM, it correlated with a gradient of microstructural tissue damage measured byMTR(r(s) = -0.65, p = 1.0e-3). Compared to clinically stable patients, patients with disability worsening were characterized by a higher percentage of DPA+ voxels in the periventricular normal-appearing WM (p = 0.025).; Conclusions; Our results demonstrate that in MS the innate immune cell activation predominates in periventricular regions and is associated with microstructural damage and disability worsening. This could result from the diffusion of proinflammatory CSF-derived factors into surrounding tissues.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide noninvasive localization of eloquent brain areas for presurgical planning. The aim of this study is the integration of MEG and fMRI maps into a CyberKnife (CK) system to optimize dose planning.
METHODS: Four patients with brain metastases in the motor area underwent functional imaging study of the hand motor cortex before radiosurgery. MEG data were acquired during a visually cued hand motor task. Motor activations were identified also using an fMRI block-designed paradigm. MEG and fMRI maps were then integrated into a CK system and contoured as organs at risk for treatment planning optimization.; RESULTS: The integration of fMRI data into the CK system was achieved for all patients by means of a standardized protocol. We also implemented an ad hoc pipeline to convert the MEG signal into a DICOM standard, to make sure that it was readable by our CK treatment planning system. Inclusion of the activation areas into the optimization plan allowed the creation of treatment plans that reduced the irradiation of the motor cortex yet not affecting the brain peripheral dose.; CONCLUSIONS: The availability of advanced neuroimaging techniques is playing an increasingly important role in radiosurgical planning strategy. We successfully imported MEG and fMRI activations into a CK system. This additional information can improve dose sparing of eloquent areas, allowing a more comprehensive investigation of the related dose-volume constraints that in theory could translate into a gain in tumor local control, and a reduction of neurological complications.

N2  -  Spatial attention and exploration are related to a predominantly right hemispheric network structure. However, the areas of the brain involved and their exact role is still debated. Spatial neglect following right hemispheric stroke lesions has been frequently viewed as a model to study these processes in humans. Previous investigations on the anatomical basis on spatial neglect predominantly focused on focal brain damage and lesion-behaviour mapping analyses. This approach might not be suited to detect remote areas structurally spared but which might contribute to the behavioural deficit. In the present study of a sample of 203 right hemispheric stroke patients, we combined connectome lesion-symptom mapping with multivariate support vector regression to unravel the complex and disconnected network structure in spatial neglect. We delineated three central nodes that were extensively disconnected from other intrahemispheric areas, namely the right superior parietal lobule, the insula, and the temporal pole. Additionally, the analysis allocated central roles within this network to the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and opercularis), right middle temporal gyrus, right temporal pole and left and right orbitofrontal cortices, including interhemispheric disconnection. Our results suggest that these structures-although not necessarily directly damaged-might play a role within the network underlying spatial neglect in humans.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Although a growing body of data support the functional connectivity between the precuneus and the medi-al temporal lobe during states of resting consciousness as well as during a diverse array of higher-order functions, direct structural evidence on this subcortical circuitry is scarce. Here, the authors investigate the very existence, anatomical consistency, morphology, and spatial relationships of the cingulum bundle V (CB-V), a fiber tract that has been reported to reside close to the inferior arm of the cingulum (CingI).
METHODS Fifteen normal, formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres from adults were treated with Klingler's method and subsequently investigated through the fiber microdissection technique in a medial to lateral direction.; RESULTS A distinct group of fibers is invariably identified in the subcortical territory of the posteromedial cortex, con- necting the precuneus and the medial temporal lobe. This tract follows the trajectory of the parietooccipital sulcus in a close spatial relationship with the CingI and the sledge runner fasciculus. It extends inferiorly to the parahippocampal place area and retrosplenial complex area, followed by a lateral curve to terminate toward the fusiform face area (Brod-mann area BA 37) and lateral piriform area (BA35). Taking into account the aforementioned subcortical architecture, the CB-V allegedly participates as a major subcortical stream within the default mode network, possibly subserving the transfer of multimodal cues relevant to visuospatial, facial, and mnemonic information to the precuneal hub. Although robust clinical evidence on the functional role of this stream is lacking, the modern neurosurgeon should be aware of this tract when manipulating cerebral areas en route to lesions residing in or around the ventricular trigone.; CONCLUSIONS Through the fiber microdissection technique, the authors were able to provide original, direct structural evidence on the existence, morphology, axonal connectivity, and correlative anatomy of what proved to be a discrete white matter pathway, previously described as the CB-V, connecting the precuneus and medial temporal lobe.; OBJECTIVE Although a growing body of data support the functional connectivity between the precuneus and the medial temporal lobe during states of resting consciousness as well as during a diverse array of higher-order functions, direct structural evidence on this subcortical circuitry is scarce.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and causes of thromboembolic events associated with endovascular embolization of asymptomatic aneurysms. Correlations between radiological findings (aneurysm size, localization, embolization time, number of coils used, as well as patient age) were evaluated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events and clinical findings.
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients treated for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (mean age, 49 yr) were evaluated. Hyperintense lesions on diffusion weighted imaging were analyzed in 50 patients. Aneurysm size was 3 to 15 mm.; RESULTS: Complete occlusion of the aneurysms was achieved in 55 of 68 (82%). One patient had a transient paresis. There was one infarction and one aneurysm rupture during the procedure with no consecutive neurological symptoms. We found new hyperintense lesions in 21 of 50 (42%) diffusion weighted imaging studies. In 43% of these, there was only one lesion smaller than 2 mm. In 33%, there was more than one lesion less than 2 mm; in 19%, we found a lesion of 2 to 10 mm in size. In one case, a lesion greater than 10 mm occurred. There was no correlation between aneurysm location and the occurrence of lesions or among the number of coils used, the size of the aneurysm, patient age, or embolization time. Mortality rate was 0%, morbidity 4.0%. If the 18 aneurysms where no diffusion weighted imaging was obtained are included, morbidity is 2.9%.; CONCLUSION: The high rate of thromboembolic events suggests that heparin is not sufficient to prevent ischemic lesions. An antiplatelet therapy, started before or during intervention, might diminish thrombus formation.

N2  -  Fine motor skills rely on the control of hand muscles exerted by a region of primary motor cortex (M1) that has been extensively investigated in monkeys. Although neuroimaging enables the exploration of this system also in humans, indirect measurements of brain activity prevent causal definitions of hand motor representations, which can be achieved using data obtained during brain mapping in tumor patients. High-frequency direct electrical stimulation delivered at rest (HF-DESRest) on the hand-knob region of the precentral gyrus has identified two sectors showing differences in cortical excitability. Using quantitative analysis of motor output elicited with HF DES-Rest, we characterized two sectors based on their excitability, higher in the posterior and lower in the anterior sector. We studied whether the different cortical excitability of these two regions reflected differences in functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC). Using healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we computed FC and SC of the anterior and the posterior hand-knob sectors identified within a large cohort of patients. The comparison of FC of the two seeds showed that the anterior hand-knob, relative to the posterior hand-knob, showed stronger functional connections with a bilateral set of parietofrontal areas responsible for integrating perceptual and cognitive hand-related sensorimotor processes necessary for goal-related actions. This was reflected in different patterns of SC between the two sectors. Our results suggest that the human hand-knob is a functionally and structurally heterogeneous region organized along a motor-cognitive gradient.
The capability to perform complex manipulative tasks is one of the major characteristics of primates and relies on the fine control of hand muscles exerted by a highly specialized region of the precentral gyrus, often termed the "hand-knob" sector. Using intraoperative brain mapping, we identify two hand-knob sectors (posterior and anterior) characterized by differences in cortical excitability. Based on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and tractography in healthy subjects, we show that posterior and anterior hand-knob sectors differ in their functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) with frontoparietal regions. Thus, anteroposterior differences in cortical excitability are paralleled by differences in FC and SC that

N2  -  A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with pronounced schizotypal traits also display particular neurophysiological and morphological features - notably with regard to left frontotemporal connectivity. However, the studies published to date have focused on subclinical subjects and psychiatric patients, rather than brain-damaged patients. Here, we used the French version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire to assess schizotypal traits in a sample of 97 patients having undergone surgical resection of a diffuse low-grade glioma. Patients having received other neurooncological treatments (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy) were not included. A combination of ROI-based based voxel-wise and tract-wise lesion-symptom mapping and a disconnectome analysis were performed, in order to identify the putative neural network associated with schizotypy. The ROI-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed a significant relationship between the cognitive-perceptual (positive) dimension of schizotypy and the left inferior gyrus (including the pars opercularis and the pars orbitalis). Importantly, we found that disconnection of the left uncinate fasciculus (UF) was a powerful predictor of the positive dimension of schizotypy. Lastly, the disconnection analysis indicated that the positive dimension of schizotypy was significantly associated with the white matter fibres deep in the left orbital and inferior frontal gyri and the left superior temporal pole, which mainly correspond to the spatial topography of the left UF. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that dysconnectivity of the neural network supplied by the left UF is associated with heightened positive schizotypal traits. Our new findings may be of value in interpreting current research in the field of biological psychiatry. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The cortical area within the human primary motor cortex (M1) that hosts the representation of the hand and fingers is known as the 'hand-knob' and is essential for voluntary hand movement. The anatomo-functional heterogeneity described within the monkey primary motor cortex (M1) in a rostro-caudal direction suggests an internal subdivision in two sectors originating different systems of connections to the spinal cord. Direct investigation of the human hand-knob has been prevented, so far, by methodological constraints. The unique setting of brain tumour resection with the brain mapping technique in awake patients enables direct electrophysiological investigation of the functional properties of the human hand-knob. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) at high frequency (HF-DES) delivered along the hand-knob in rostrocaudal direction, i.e., from the central to the precentral sulcus, were recorded from the hand/arm muscles in patients at rest. The sites located near the precentral sulcus identified with HF-DES were then stimulated with low-frequency DES (LF-DES) during a hand manipulation task (HMt) to assess whether DES affected task execution. From the stimulated sites, corticofugal projections and U-shaped tracts connecting with adjacent gyri were traced using diffusion tensor and spherical deconvolution tractography. Analysis of MEPs showed a rostro-caudal gradient of cortical excitability along the hand-knob (the rostral sector being less excitable). Stimulation of rostral sites during the HMt impaired the task by inducing dysfunctional recruitment or, alternatively, suppression of distal muscles. Diffusion tractography showed different patterns of rostro-caudal connectivity for the U-shaped tracts. Overall data suggests, in humans, the anatomo-functional subdivision of the human hand-knob in two sectors, possibly subserving different roles in motor control. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  recent studies on healthy individuals suggest that changes in the sensibility toward internal bod-ily sensations across the lifespan affect the ability to mentally represent one's body, in terms of action-oriented and nonaction-oriented body representation (BR). Little is known about the neural correlates of this relation. Here we fill this gap using the neuropsychological model provided by focal brain damage. Sixty-five patients with uni-lateral stroke (20 with left and 45 with right brain damage, LBD and RBD, respectively) participated in this study. Both action-oriented BR and nonaction-oriented BR were tested; interoceptive sensibility was assessed as well. First, we tested whether interoceptive sensibility predicted action-oriented BR and nonaction-oriented BR, in RBD and LBD separately. Then, a track-wise hodological lesion-deficit analysis was performed in a subsample of twenty-four patients to test the brain network supporting this relation. We found that interoceptive sensibility pre-dicted the performances in the task tapping nonaction-oriented BR. The higher interoceptive sensibility was, the worse patients performed. This relation was associated with the disconnection probability of the corticospinal tract, the fronto-insular tract, and the pons. We expand over the previous findings on healthy individuals, support-ing the idea that high levels of interoceptive sensibility negatively affect BR. Specific frontal projections and fron-tal u-shaped tracts may play a pivotal role in such an effect, likely affecting the development of a first-order representation of the self within the brainstem autoregulatory centers and posterior insula and of a second -order representation of the self within the anterior insula and higher-order prefrontal areas.(c) 2023 IBRO.

N2  -  Essential tremor is the most common movement disorder in adults. In patients who are not responsive to medical treatment, functional neurosurgery and, more recently, transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy are considered effective therapeutic approaches. However, the structural brain changes following a thalamotomy that mediates the clinical improvement are still unclear. In here diffusion weighted images were acquired in a cohort of 24 essential tremor patients before and 3 months after unilateral transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy targeting at the posteroventral part of the VIM. Microstructural changes along the DRTT were quantified by means of probabilistic tractography, and later related to the clinical improvement of the patients at 3-months and at 1-year after the intervention. In addition the changes along two neighboring tracts, that is, the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus, were assessed, as well as the relation between these changes and the presence of side effects. Thalamic lesions produced local and distant alterations along the trajectory of the DRTT, and each correlated with clinical improvement. Regarding side effects, gait imbalance after thalamotomy was associated with greater impact on the DRTT, whereas the presence of paresthesias was significantly related to a higher overlap between the lesion and the medial lemniscus. This work represents the largest series describing the microstructural changes following transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy in essential tremor. These results suggest that clinical benefits are specific for the impact on the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway, thus reaffirming the potential of tractography to aid thalamotomy targeting.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Maximal safe resection of gliomas near motor pathways is facilitated by intraoperative mapping. The authors and other groups have described the use of bipolar or monopolar direct stimulation to identify functional tissue, as well as transcranial or transcortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to monitor motor pathways. Here, the authors describe their initial experience using all 3 modalities to identify, monitor, and preserve cortical and subcortical motor systems during glioma surgery. METHODS Intraoperative mapping data were extracted from a prospective registry of glioma resections near motor pathways. Additional demographic, clinical, pathological, and imaging data were extracted from the electronic medical record. All patients with new or worsened postoperative motor deficits were followed for at least 6 months. RESULTS Between January 2018 and August 2019, 59 operations were performed in 58 patients. Overall, patients in 6 cases (10.2%) had new or worse immediate postoperative deficits. Patients with temporary deficits all had at least Medi- cal Research Council grade 4/5 power. Only 2 patients (3.4%) had permanently worsened deficits after 6 months, both of which were associated with diffusion restriction consistent with ischemia within the corticospinal tract. One patient's deficit improved to 4/5 and the other to 4/5 proximally and 3/5 distally in the lower limb, allowing ambulation following rehabilitation. Subcortical motor pathways were identified in 51 cases (86.4%) with monopolar high-frequency stimula- tion, but only in 6 patients using bipolar stimulation. Transcranial or cortical MEPs were diminished in only 6 cases, 3 of which had new or worsened deficits, with 1 permanent deficit. Insula location (p = 0.001) and reduction in MEPs (p = 0.01) were the only univariate predictors of new or worsened postoperative deficits. Insula location was the only predictor of permanent deficits (p = 0.046). The median extent of resection was 98.0%. CONCLUSIONS Asleep triple motor mapping is safe and resulted in a low rate of deficits without compromising the extent of resection.

N2  -  Impairment of the geniculostriate pathway results in scotomas in the corresponding part of the visual field. Here, we present a case of patient IB with left eye microphthalmia and with lesions in most of the left geniculostriate pathway, including the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). Despite the severe lesions, the patient has a very narrow scotoma in the peripheral part of the lower-right-hemifield only (beyond 15 degrees of eccentricity) and complete visual field representation in the primary visual cortex. Population receptive field mapping (pRF) of the patient's visual field reveals orderly eccentricity maps together with contralateral activation in both hemispheres. With diffusion tractography, we revealed connections between superior colliculus (SC) and cortical structures in the hemisphere affected by the lesions, which could mediate the retinotopic reorganization at the cortical level. Our results indicate an astonishing case for the flexibility of the developing retinotopic maps where the contralateral thalamus receives fibers from both the nasal and temporal retinae.

N2  -  Background:The fornix is the primary axonal tract of the hippocampus, connecting it to modulatory subcortical structures. This review reveals that fornix damage causes cognitive deficits that closely mirror those resulting from hippocampal lesions.
Methods:We reviewed the literature on the fornix, spanning non-human animal lesion research, clinical case studies of human patients with fornix damage, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) work that evaluates fornix microstructure in vivo.; Results:The fornix is essential for memory formation because it serves as the conduit for theta rhythms and acetylcholine, as well as providing mnemonic representations to deep brain structures that guide motivated behavior, such as when and where to eat. In rodents and non-human primates, fornix lesions lead to deficits in conditioning, reversal learning, and navigation. In humans, damage to the fornix manifests as anterograde amnesia. DWI research reveals that the fornix plays a key role in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease, and can potentially predict conversion from the former to the latter. Emerging DWI findings link perturbations in this structure to schizophrenia, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Cutting-edge research has investigated how deep brain stimulation of the fornix can potentially attenuate memory loss, control epileptic seizures, and even improve mood.; Conclusions:The fornix is essential to a fully functioning memory system and is implicated in nearly all neurological functions that rely on the hippocampus. Future research needs to use optimized DWI methods to study the fornix in vivo, which we discuss, given the difficult nature of fornix reconstruction.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results in high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Early and automatic diagnosis of AIS can help clinicians administer the appropriate interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep symmetric 3D convolutional neural network (DeepSym-3D-CNN) for automated AIS diagnosis via diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images.; METHODS: This study includes 190 study subjects (97 AIS and 93 Non-AIS) by collecting both DWI and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) images. 3D DWI brain images are split into left and right hemispheres and input into two paths. A map with 125x253x14x12 features is extracted by each path of Inception Modules. After the features computed from two paths are subtracted through L-2 normalization, four multi-scale convolution layers produce the final predation. Three comparative models using DWI images including MedicalNet with transfer learning, Simple DeepSym-3D-CNN (each 3D Inception Module is replaced by a simple 3D-CNN layer), and L-1 DeepSym-3D-CNN (L-2 normalization is replaced by L-1 normalization) are constructed. Moreover, using ADC images and the combination of DWI and ADC images as inputs, the performance of DeepSym-3D-CNN is also investigated. Performance levels of all three models are evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation and the values of area under ROC curve (AUC) are compared by DeLong's test.; RESULTS: DeepSym-3D-CNN achieves an accuracy of 0.850 and an AUC of 0.864. DeLong's test of AUC values demonstrates that DeepSym-3D-CNN significantly outperforms other comparative models (p < 0.05). The highlighted regions in the feature maps of DeepSym-3D-CNN spatially match with AIS lesions. Meanwhile, DeepSym-3D-CNN using DWI images presents the significant higher AUC than that either using ADC images or using DWI-ADC images based on DeLong's test (p < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: DeepSym-3D-CNN is a potential method for automatically identifying AIS via DWI images and can be extended to other diseases with asymmetric lesions.

N2  -  Kernohan-Woltman notch phenomenon (KWNP) is a false localising sign which may still cause diagnostic confusion. It was first described by Kernohan and Woltman in 1929, through post-mortem studies on 297 patients following cases of false localisation. They proposed that raised intracranial pressure causes uncal herniation, which can compress the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the tough tentorium, manifesting as hemiparesis ipsilateral to the primary brain lesion. A number of case reports have been written since the original description of this phenomenon, primarily secondary to intracranial bleeds, and little has been written about long-term outcome of patients who develop KNWP. We performed a literature search of all published cases of KWNP, and reviewed its clinical, pathophysiological, imaging and neurophysiological characteristics. Furthermore, we summarise the long-term outcomes of these patients as described by case reports, with the aim to improve understanding of rehabilitation potential. Thirty-eight cases were found through a PubMed search. We also included a case from our own Trust, making the total number of cases in the analysis 39. Thirty-six cases were secondary to intracranial bleeds (22 of which were traumatic), the remainder were due to an arachnoid cyst, high grade glioma, and reabsorption bone syndrome. Additional clinical manifestations to hemibrachiocrural syndrome included third nerve palsy, mydriasis of the contralateral and ipsilateral pupils, facial nerve palsies, and parkinsonism. Twenty-six (67%) patients had improvement in motor function of varying degrees, with twelve (31%) patients attaining complete motor recovery or independence. More studies on long-term outcome of patients who develop KWNP are needed to understand rehabilitation potential.

N2  -  Photothermal therapy and ablation are commonplace medical procedures employed for treatment of tumors, vascular and brain abnormalities as well as other disorders that require selective destruction of tissues. Yet, accurate mapping of the dynamic temperature field distribution in the treated region represents an unmet clinical need, strongly affecting the clinical outcome of these interventions. We introduce a fast three-dimensional temperature mapping method based on real-time optoacoustic sensing of the treated region coupled with a thermal-diffusion-based model of heat distribution in tissues. Deviations of the optoacoustic temperature readings provided at 40 ms intervals remained below 10% in tissue-mimicking phantom experiments for temperature elevations above 3 degrees C, as validated by simultaneous thermocouple measurements. Performance of the new method to dynamically estimate the volumetric temperature distribution was further showcased in post-mortem mouse imaging experiments. The newly discovered capacity to non-invasively measure the temperature map in an entire treated volume with both high spatial and temporal resolutions holds potential for improving safety and efficacy of light-based therapeutic interventions.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Despite the disabling deficits of motor apraxia and sensory ataxia resulting from intraoperative injury of the superior thalamocortical tracts (TCTs), region-specific electrophysiological localization is currently lacking. Herein, the authors describe a novel TCT mapping paradigm.METHODS Three patients, 1 asleep and 2 awake, underwent glioma resection affecting primarily the somatosensory cortex and underlying TCT. Stimulation was performed at the median, ulnar, and posterior tibial nerves. Parameters comprised single anodal pulses (duration 200-500 mu sec, 2.1-4.7 Hz) with a current ranging from 10 to 25 mA. Recordings were captured with a bipolar stimulation probe, avoiding the classic collision technique. Positive localization sites were used to tractographically reconstruct the TCT in the third case.RESULTS Employing one electrophysiological paradigm, the TCT was localized subcortically in all 3 cases by using a bipolar probe, peak range of 19.6-29.2 msec, trough of 23.3-34.8 msec, stimulation range of 10-25 mA. In the last case, tractographic reconstruction of the TCT validated a highly accurate TCT localization within a specific region of the posterior limb of the internal capsule.CONCLUSIONS The authors describe the first electrophysiological technique for intraoperative localization and protection of the TCT in both asleep and awake craniotomies with tractographic validation, while avoiding the collision paradigm. None of the above paradigms have been previously reported. More data are required to further validate this technique.

N2  -  Background: Stereotactic targets for thalamotomy are usually derived from population-based coordinates. Individual anatomy is used only to scale the coordinates based on the location of some internal guide points. While on conventional MR imaging the thalamic nuclei are indistinguishable, recently it has become possible to identify individual thalamic nuclei using different connectivity profiles, as defined by MR diffusion tractography.
Methodology and Principal Findings: Here we investigated the inter-individual variation of the location of target nuclei for thalamotomy: the putative ventralis oralis posterior (Vop) and the ventral intermedius (Vim) nucleus as defined by probabilistic tractography. We showed that the mean inter-individual distance of the peak Vop location is 7.33 mm and 7.42 mm for Vim. The mean overlap between individual Vop nuclei was 40.2% and it was 31.8% for Vim nuclei. As a proof of concept, we also present a patient who underwent Vop thalamotomy for untreatable tremor caused by traumatic brain injury and another patient who underwent Vim thalamotomy for essential tremor. The probabilistic tractography indicated that the successful tremor control was achieved with lesions in the Vop and Vim respectively.; Conclusions: Our data call attention to the need for a better appreciation of the individual anatomy when planning stereotactic functional neurosurgery.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a promising stroke drug candidate. The present phase IIa study assessed safety and tolerability over a broad dose range of G-CSF doses in acute ischemic stroke patients and explored outcome data.
Methods-Four intravenous dose regimens (total cumulative doses of 30-180 mu gkg over the course of 3 days) of G-CSF were tested in 44 patients in a national, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation study (NCT00132470; www.clinicaltrial.gov). Main inclusion criteria were a 12-hour time window after stroke onset, infarct localization to the middle cerebral artery territory, a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale range of 4 to 22, and presence of diffusion-weighted imagingperfusion-weighted imaging mismatch.; Results-Concerning the primary safety end points, we observed no increase of thromboembolic events in the active treatment groups, and no increase in related serious adverse events. G-CSF led to expected increases in neutrophils and monocytes that resolved rapidly after end of treatment. We observed a clinically insignificant drug-related decrease of platelets. As expected from the low number of patients, we did not observe significant differences in clinical outcome in treatment vs. placebo. In exploratory analyses, we observed an interesting dose-dependent beneficial effect of treatment in patients with DWI lesions >14-17 cm(3).; Conclusions-We conclude that G-CSF was well-tolerated even at high dosages in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and that a substantial increase in leukocytes appears not problematic in stroke patients. In addition, exploratory analyses suggest treatment effects in patients with larger baseline diffusion-weighted imaging lesions. The obtained data provide the basis for a second trial aimed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of G-CSF on clinical end points. (Stroke. 2010;41:2545-2551.)

N2  -  Despite remarkable progress, the microsurgical extirpation of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) even by experienced neurosurgeons is not always easy or safe. This article focuses on how to render AVM surgery safer, and offers strategies and tactics for avoiding perilous bleeding and preserving postoperative neurological function. Our treatment strategies and surgical techniques are offered from the operating surgeon's perspective. An understanding of pathophysiology of cerebral AVMs is important for their appropriate surgical treatment. Sophisticated neuroirnaging techniques and scrupulous neurophys i o logical examinations alert to possible complications, and improved surgical approaches help to minimize the sequelae of unanticipated complications. At the early stage of cerebral AVM surgery, extensive dissection of the sulci, fissures, and subarachnoid cistern should be performed to expose feeders, nidus, and drainers. Problems with the surgery of large and/or deep-seated lesions are exacerbated when arterial bleeding from the niclus continues even after all major feeders are thought to have been occluded. We routinely place catheters for angiography at the surgery of complex AVMs to find missing feeding arteries or to identify the real-time hemodynamic status of the lesion. Temporary clip application on feeders and less coagulation of the nidus is necessary to control intraniclal pressure and to avoid uncontrollable bleeding from the nidus and adjacent brain. Intraoperative navigation images superimposed on tractography images can provide us with valuable information to minimize neurological deficits. Deeper insight into AVM nature and into events that occur during AVM surgery as well as the inclusion of molecular biological approaches will open new horizons for the safe and effective treatment of AVMs.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Establishing the neurological localization doctrine for the contralateral hemispheric control of motor functions in the second half of the 19th century, researchers faced the challenge of recognizing false localizing signs, in particular paradoxical or ipsilateral hemiparesis (IH). Despite tremendous progress in current methods of neuroradiological and electrophysiological exploration, a complete understanding of this phenomenon has yet to be attained.
METHODS The authors researched the well-described cases of hemiparesishemiplegia ipsilateral to an intracranial lesion published in the scientific literature in the pre-MRI era (before 1980). A comprehensive review of the physiopathological mechanisms proposed for paradoxical hemiparesis throughout this period, as well as the pathological evidence substantiating them, is provided.; RESULTS A collection of 75 patients with hemiparesishemiplegia ipsilateral to the primary intracranial lesion reported between 1858 and 1979 were eligible for analysis. Most cases occurred in adults with supratentorial, slowly developing, extraparenchymatous mass lesions, such as neoplasms (38%) or chronic subdural hematomas (36%). Physiopathological theories proposed by the neurologists who investigated IH can be grouped into 4 major concepts: 1) lack of anatomical decussation of the corticospinal tract; 2) impaired functional activation of the contralateral hemisphere by the lesioned dominant hemisphere through the callosal connections; 3) Kernohan's notch phenomenon, or mechanical injury of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the free edge of the tentorium; and 4) cerebrovascular dysfunction involving the contralateral hemisphere owing to kinking and mechanical flattening of the carotid artery contralateral to the primary intracranial lesion.; CONCLUSIONS IH represents a still underdiagnosed paradoxical neurological phenomenon. With the aid of modern neuroradiological and neurophysiological methods, Kernohan's peduncle notch mechanism has been confirmed to cause IH in many of the cases reported in recent decades. Nevertheless, alternative functional andor vascular mechanisms must be investigated further for unexplained IH cases, in particular for transitory IH without evidence of peduncle injury. The historical theories reviewed in this paper represent a conceptual framework that may be helpful for this purpose.

N2  -  Simple Summary
Presurgical motor mapping of cortical muscle representations by single-pulse navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (sp-nTMS) is used to localize and enclose motor function in patients harboring motor-eloquent lesions. This study investigates paired-pulse nTMS (pp-nTMS) with biphasic pulses for motor mapping of lower extremity (lE) muscle representations, showing that significantly lower stimulation intensities are needed while reliable motor maps can be achieved even in the most demanding patient cases in whom conventionally used sp-nTMS fails. Thus, novel pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses may have potential to considerably facilitate improvements of currently used nTMS-based mapping procedures in the preoperative workup of neurooncological patients.; Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is increasingly used for mapping of motor function prior to surgery in patients harboring motor-eloquent brain lesions. To date, single-pulse nTMS (sp-nTMS) has been predominantly used for this purpose, but novel paired-pulse nTMS (pp-nTMS) with biphasic pulse application has been made available recently. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses in comparison to conventionally used sp-nTMS for preoperative motor mapping of lower extremity (lE) muscle representations. Thirty-nine patients (mean age: 56.3 +- 13.5 years, 69.2% males) harboring motor-eloquent brain lesions of different entity underwent motor mapping of lE muscle representations in lesion-affected hemispheres and nTMS-based tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) using data from sp-nTMS and pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses, respectively. Compared to sp-nTMS, pp-nTMS enabled motor mapping with lower stimulation intensities (61.8 +- 13.8% versus 50.7 +- 11.6% of maximum stimulator output, p < 0.0001), and it provided reliable motor maps even in the most demanding cases where sp-nTMS failed (pp-nTMS was able to provide a motor map in five patients in whom sp-nTMS did not provide any motor-positive points, and pp-nTMS was the only modality to provide a motor map in one patient who also did not show motor-positive points during intraoperative stimulation). Fiber volumes of the tracked CST were slightly higher when motor maps of pp-nTMS were used, and CST tracking using pp-nTMS data was also possible in the five patients in whom sp-nTMS failed. In conclusion, application of pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses enables preoperative motor mapping of lE muscle representations even in the most challenging patients in whom the motor system is at high risk due to lesion location or resection.

N2  -  Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue, revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of magnitude in the last decade(1). In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal decorrelation of contrast agents-inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images, yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.

N2  -  Hippocampus demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) have been frequently observed in ex vivo histopathological studies; however, they are difficult to image and quantify in vivo. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 mapping could potentially detect such regional in vivo changes if acquired with sufficient spatial resolution. The goal here was to evaluate whether there are focal hippocampal abnormalities in 43 MS patients (35 relapsing-remitting, eight secondary progressive) with and without cognitive impairment (CI) versus 43 controls using high-resolution 1 mm isotropic DTI, as well as complementary methods of T2-weighted and T2 mapping at 3 T. Abnormal hippocampus regions were identified voxel-by-voxel by using mean diffusivity (MD)/T2 thresholds and avoiding voxels attributed to cerebrospinal fluid. When compared with controls, averaged left/right whole hippocampus MD was higher in both MS groups, while lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and volume, and higher T2 relaxometry and T2-weighted signal values, were only significant in CI MS. The hippocampal MD and T2 images/maps were not uniformly affected and focal regions of elevated MD/T2 were evident in MS patients. Both CI and not CI MS groups showed greater proportional areas of the hippocampus with elevated MD, whereas only the CI group showed a greater proportional area of elevated T2 relaxation times or T2-weighted signal. Higher T2 relaxometry and T2-weighted signal values of elevated regions correlated with greater disability and whole hippocampus FA negatively correlated with physical fatigue. High-resolution hippocampus DTI and T2 mapping with less partial volume effects showed whole hippocampus abnormalities with regional elevations of MD/T2 in MS, which could be interpreted as potentially from demyelination, neuron loss, and/or inflammation, and which overall were more extensive in the hippocampus of patients with larger total brain lesion volumes and CI.

N2  -  Background: The surgical management of deep intra-axial lesions still requires microsurgical approaches that utilize retraction of deep white matter to obtain adequate visualization. We report our experience with a new tubular retractor system, designed specifically for intracranial applications, linked with frameless neuronavigation for a cohort of intraventricular and deep intra-axial tumors.
Methods: The ViewSite Brain Access System (Vycor, Inc) was used in a series of 9 adult and pediatric patients with a variety of pathologies. Histological diagnoses either resected or biopsied with the system included: colloid cyst, DNET, papillary pineal tumor, anaplastic astrocytoma, toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. The locations of the lesions approached include: lateral ventricle, basal ganglia, pulvinarposterior thalamus and insular cortex. Post-operative imaging was assessed to determine extent of resection and extent of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory (based on T-2FLAIR and diffusion restrictionADC signal).; Results: Satisfactory resection or biopsy was obtained in all patients. Radiographic analysis demonstrated evidence of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory in one patient. None of the patients experienced neurological deficits as a result of white matter retractionmanipulation.; Conclusion: Based on a retrospective review of our experience, we feel that this accesss system, when used in conjunction with frameless neuronavigational systems, provides adequate visualization for tumor resection while permitting the use of standard microsurgical techniques through minimally invasive craniotomies. Our initial data indicate that this system may minimize white matter injury, but further studies are necessary.

N2  -  While mass spectrometry (MS) imaging is widely used to investigate the molecular composition of ex vivo slices of cancerous tumors, little is known about how variations in the cellular properties of cancer tissue can influence cancer biomarker ion images. To better understand the basis for variations in the abundances of cancer biomarker ions seen in MS images of relatively homogeneous ex vivo tumor samples, sections of snap frozen human breast cancer murine xenografts were subjected to desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) imaging. Serial sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to detailed morphometric cellular analysis, using a commercial digital pathology platform augmented with custom-tailored image analysis algorithms developed in-house. Gross morphological heterogeneities due to stroma, vasculature, and noncancer cells were mapped in the tumor and found to not correlate with the areas of suppressed cancer biomarker abundance. Instead, the ion abundances of major breast cancer biomarkers were found to correlate with the cytoplasmic area of cancer cells that comprised the tumor tissue. Therefore, detailed cellular analyses can be used to rationalize subtle heterogeneities in ion abundance in MS images, not explained by the presence of gross morphological heterogeneities such as stroma.

N2  -  PURPOSE
The characterization and differentiation of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has important diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic significance. The purpose of this study is to characterize the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopic (MRS) findings in CNS Lymphoma.; MATERIALS AND METHODS; Twenty consecutive patients (male n = 12, female n = 8) with histopathologically proven CNS lymphoma were retrospectively evaluated during this study from July 2005 to April 2007. Patients included immunocompromised (n = 9) and immunocompetent (n = 11) individuals. MR Imaging (pretreatment n = 13), pre- and post-treatment (n = 7) included DWI (n = 20) (b = 1000smm2) and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps of all patients. MRS was performed (n = 10) with PRESS (point-resolved spectroscopy) sequence (multivoxel n = 8, single voxel n = 2) with a TE of 144 msec. All patients were histopathologically confirmed to have lymphoma by biopsy.; RESULTS; Areas of restricted diffusion were observed in 90 % (n = 1820) on pretreatment scans. The diffusion restriction was variable on post-treatment scans. Median metabolite ratios in 10 patients were ChoCr- 2.12, NAACho - .49, and NAACr - 1.64. Presence of lactate or lipid was noted in 90 % (n = 910). Sites of lesion location were subcortical white matter (n - 6), basal ganglia (n = 4), corpus callosum (n = 3), extra-axial space including cavernous sinus (n = 5), cerebellum (n = 1), and lateral ventricle (n - 1).; CONCLUSION; Restricted diffusion is a consistent imaging finding in CNS lymphoma in immunocompetent patients. Spectroscopy is helpful in initial imaging diagnosis and post-treatment surveillance. These lesions are usually paraventricular in location. MR imaging appearances differ among immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals in most cases.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysphagia is a common deficit after a stroke and is associated with serious complications. It is not yet fully clear which brain regions are directly related to swallowing. Previous lesion symptom mapping studies may have overlooked structural disconnections that could be responsible for poststroke dysphagia. Here, we aimed to predict and explain the relationship between poststroke dysphagia and the topologic distribution of structural disconnection via a multivariate predictive framework.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled first-ever ischemic stroke patients classified as full per-oral nutrition (71 patients) and nonoral nutrition necessary (43 patients). After propensity score matching, 43 patients for each group were enrolled (full per-oral nutrition group with 17 women, 68 +/- 15years; nonoral nutrition necessary group with 13 women, 75 +/- 11years). The structural disconnectome was estimated by using the lesion segmented from acute phase diffusion-weighted images. The prediction of poststroke dysphagia by using the structural disconnectome and demographics was performed in a leave-one-out manner.RESULTS: Using both direct and indirect disconnection matrices of the motor network, the disconnectome-based prediction model could predict poststroke dysphagia above the level of chance (accuracy = 68.6%, permutation P = .001). When combined with demographic data, the classification accuracy reached 72.1%. The edges connecting the right insula and left motor strip were the most informative in prediction.CONCLUSIONS: Poststroke dysphagia could be predicted by using the structural disconnectome derived from acute phase diffusion-weighted images. Specifically, the direct and indirect disconnection within the motor network was the most informative in predicting poststroke dysphagia.

N2  -  Background: Recently, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has been suggested to be useful in preoperative functional localization of motor cortex in patients having tumors close to the somatomotor cortex. Resection of tumors in anatomically predicted eloquent areas without adverse effects have emphasized functional plasticity elicited by intracranial pathology.
Objective: To describe functional plasticity of motor cortex indicated by nTMS in two patients with epilepsy.; Methods: nTMS, functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion-tensor (DT)-tractography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were utilized to preoperatively localize motor cortical areas in the workup for epilepsy surgery. The localizations were compared with each other, with the cortical anatomical landmarks, and in one patient with invasive electrical cortical stimulation (ECS).; Results: In two out of 19 studied patients, nTMS identified motor cortical sites that differed from those indicated by anatomical landmarks. In one patient, nTMS activated preferentially premotor cortex rather than pathways originating from the precentral gyrus. MEG and fMRI localizations conformed with nTMS whereas ECS localized finger motor function into the precentral gyrus. Resection of the area producing motor responses in biphasic nTMS did not produce a motor deficit. In the other patient, nTMS indicated abnormal ipsilateral hand motor cortex localization and confirmed the functionality of aberrant motor cortical representations of the left foot also indicated by fMRI and DT-tractography.; Conclusion: nTMS may reveal the functional plasticity and shifts of motor cortical function. Epileptic foci may modify cortical inhibition and the nTMS results. Therefore, in some patients with epilepsy, the nTMS results need to be interpreted with caution with regard to surgical planning.

N2  -  Frontal and temporal white matter pathways play key roles in language processing, but the specific computations supported by different tracts remain a matter of study. A role in speech planning has been proposed for a recently described pathway, the frontal aslant tract (FAT), which connects the posterior inferior frontal gyrus to the pre-SMA. Here, we use longitudinal functional and structural MRI and behavioral testing to evaluate the behavioral consequences of a lesion to the left FAT that was incurred during surgical resection of a frontal glioma in a 60-year-old woman, Patient AF. The pattern of performance in AF is compared, using the same measures, with that in a 37-year-old individual who underwent a left anterior temporal resection and hippocampectomy (Patient AG). AF and AG were both cognitively intact preoperatively but exhibited specific and doubly dissociable behavioral deficits postoperatively: AF had dysfluent speech but no word finding difficulty, whereas AG had word finding difficulty but otherwise fluent speech. Probabilistic tractography showed that the left FAT was lesioned postoperatively in AF (but not AG) whereas the inferior longitudinal fasciculus was lesioned in AG (but not AF). Those structural changes were supported by corresponding changes in functional connectivity to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus: decreased functional connectivity postoperatively between the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and pre-SMA in AF (but not AG) and decreased functional connectivity between the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus in AG (but not AF). We suggest from these findings that the left FAT serves as a key communicative link between sentence planning and lexical access processes.

N2  -  Purpose: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) may provide quantitative maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because labeled water exchanges with tissue water, this study evaluates the influence of tissue T-1 on CBF quantification using ASL.
Methods: To locally modify T-1 , a low dose of manganese (Mn) was intracerebrally injected in one hemisphere of 19 rats (cortex or striatum). Tissue T-1 and CBF were mapped using inversion recovery and continuous ASL experiments at 4.7T.; Results: Mn reduced the tissue T-1 by more than 30% but had little impact on other tissue properties as assessed via dynamic susceptibility and diffusion MRI. Using a singlecompartment model, the use of a single tissue T-1 value yielded a mean relative ipsilateral (Mn-injected) to contralateral (noninjected) CBF difference of -34% in cortex and -22% in striatum tissue. With a T-1 map, these values became -7% and vertical bar 8%, respectively.; Conclusion: A low dose of Mn reduces the tissue T-1 without modifying CBF. Heterogeneous T-1 impacts the ASL estimate of CBF in a region-dependent way. In animals, and when T-1 modifications exceed the accuracy with which the tissue T-1 can be determined, an estimate of tissue T-1 should be obtained when quantifying CBF with an ASL technique.

N2  -  Several mechanisms have been attributed to post-stroke loss and recovery of language functions. However, the significance and timing of domain-general and homotopic right-hemispheric activation is controversial. We aimed to examine the effect of left-hemispheric lesion location and time post-stroke on right-hemispheric activation. Voxel-based lesion analyses were informed by auditory language-related fMRI activation of 71 patients with left middle cerebral artery stroke examined longitudinally in the acute, subacute and early chronic phase. Language activation was determined in several right-hemispheric regions of interest and served as regressor of interest for voxel-based lesion analyses. We found that an acute to chronic increase of language activation in the right supplementary motor area was associated with lesions to the left extreme capsule as part of the ventral language pathway. Importantly, this activation increase correlated significantly with improvement of out-ofscanner comprehension abilities. We interpret our findings in terms of successful domain-general compensation in patients with critical left frontotemporal disconnection due to damage to the ventral language pathway but relatively spared cortical language areas.

N2  -  Sam Ng et al. combine direct electrostimulation and population-based streamline tractography to map the disconnectivity fingerprints characterizing dissociated forms of alexia in neurosurgical patients with tumors close to the visual word form area. Their data sheds light on the anatomical background for cognitive and neurocomputational models of reading
For over 150 years, the study of patients with acquired alexia has fueled research aimed at disentangling the neural system critical for reading. An unreached goal, however, relates to the determination of the fiber pathways that root the different visual and linguistic processes needed for accurate word reading. In a unique series of neurosurgical patients with a tumor close to the visual word form area, we combine direct electrostimulation and population-based streamline tractography to map the disconnectivity fingerprints characterizing dissociated forms of alexia. Comprehensive analyses of disconnectivity matrices establish similarities and dissimilarities in the disconnection patterns associated with pure, phonological and lexical-semantic alexia. While disconnections of the inferior longitudinal and posterior arcuate fasciculi are common to all alexia subtypes, disconnections of the long arcuate and vertical occipital fasciculi are specific to phonological and pure alexia, respectively. These findings provide a strong anatomical background for cognitive and neurocomputational models of reading.

N2  -  Objectives: As the mesencephalic locomotor center, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is known to be involved in control of locomotor function. We investigated neural connectivity of the PPN in relation to walking ability in chronic patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: Forty-three consecutive chronic patients with subcortical hemorrhage and 20 healthy control subjects were recruited. A seed region of interest was manually drawn on the PPN and connectivity of the PPN was measured. Results: In the affected hemisphere, connectivity with the ipsilesional cerebellar locomotor center and connectivity with the contralesional pontine locomotor center were decreased in patients who could not walk, compared with patients who could walk and normal controls (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Connectivity between the PPN and ipsi-lesional cerebellum locomotor center and contralesional pontine locomotor center in the affected hemisphere appears to be related to walking ability.

N2  -  Objective: Single-pulse navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (sp-nTMS) is used for presurgical motor mapping in patients with motor-eloquent lesions. However, recently introduced paired-pulse nTMS (pp-nTMS) with biphasic pulses could improve motor mapping. Methods: Thirty-four patients (mean age: 56.0 +/- 12.7 years, 53.0% high-grade glioma) with motor eloquent lesions underwent motor mapping of upper extremity representations and nTMS-based tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) by both sp-nTMS and pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses for the tumor affected hemisphere before resection. Results: In three patients (8.8%), conventional sp-nTMS did not provide motor-positive points, in contrast to pp-nTMS that was capable of generating motor maps in all patients. Good concordance between ppnTMS and sp-nTMS in the spatial location of motor hotspots and center of gravity (CoG) as well as for CST tracking was observed, with pp-nTMS leading to similar motor map volumes (585.0 +/- 667.8 vs. 586.8 +/- 204.2 mm(3), p = 0.9889) with considerably lower resting motor thresholds (35.0 +/- 8.8 vs. 32.8 +/- 7.6% of stimulator output, p = 0.0004). Conclusions: Pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses may provide motor maps even in highly demanding cases with tumor-affected motor structures or edema, using lower stimulation intensity compared to sp-nTMS.Significance: Pp-nTMS with biphasic pulses could replace standardly used sp-nTMS for motor mapping and may be safer due to lower stimulation intensity.

N2  -  Object. The atrium of the lateral ventricle is often affected by tumors, and some patients with these tumors suffer neurological deficits, including hemiparesis after surgery. The authors of this study investigated the possible mechanisms causing the relatively high incidences of ischemic complications associated with surgery approaching the atrium of the lateral ventricle.
Methods. Clinical records and radiological images of 28 patients were retrospectively studied. These patients had their lateral ventricles opened at the atrium during the resection of gliomas as well as other nonbenign brain tumors, and were treated for gliomas at our tertiary referral center in the Tohoku district, Japan, between January 2008 and December 2010.; Results. Routine postoperative diffusion-weighted MR images obtained within 72 hours after surgery detected infarction in the periatrialperiventricular regions in 7 patients, presumably corresponding to the lateral posterior choroidal artery (LPChA) territory. Five of these 7 patients suffered neurological sequelae with varying severities. The choroid plexus at the atrium was coagulated to achieve hemostasis during the surgery in all of these patients. Detailed analysis of microangiograms revealed ventriculofugal arteries arising from the lateral ventricle. Damage of the subependymal artery that supplies the ventriculofugal arteries caused by coagulation of the choroid plexus at the atrium probably resulted in the infarction in these patients.; Conclusions. Neurosurgeons must be aware of the possibility of LPChA territory infarction during surgery in the atrial or periatrial regions caused by subependymal artery obstruction after manipulating or coagulating the choroid plexus near the atrium.

N2  -  Mapping the lower extremity with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) still remains challenging for the investigator. Clinical factors influencing leg mapping with nTMS have not been fully investigated yet. The aim of the study was to identify factors which influence the possibility of eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). Patient records, imaging, nTMS examinations and tractography were retrospectively evaluated. 48 nTMS examinations were performed in 46 brain tumor patients. Reproducible MEPs were recorded in 20 patients (41.67%). Younger age (p = 0.044) and absence of perifocal edema (p = 0.035, Cramer's V = 0.34, OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.06-0.81) facilitated mapping the TA muscle. Leg motor deficit (p = 0.49, Cramer's V = 0.12, OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.12-2.36), tumor entity (p = 0.36, Cramer's V = 0.22), tumor location (p = 0.52, Cramer's V = 0.26) and stimulation intensity (p = 0.158) were no significant factors. The distance between the tumor and the pyramidal tract was higher (p = 0.005) in patients with successful mapping of the TA. The possibility to stimulate the leg motor area was associated with no postoperative aggravation of motor deficits in general (p = 0.005, Cramer's V = 0.45, OR = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.46-0.85) but could not serve as a specific predictor of postoperative lower extremity function. In conclusion, successful mapping of the TA muscle for neurosurgical planning is influenced by young patient age, absence of edema and greater distance to the CST, whereas tumor entity and stimulation intensity were non-significant.

N2  -  Interpretation of space is an important determinant of human behaviour. Delusions of space, or reduplicative paramnesias, are a particularly disturbing form of spatial disorientation characterized by the patients' strong belief of place reduplication, transformation or mislocation. Their occurrence following focal brain damage provides a unique opportunity to unveil the structural-functional basis of space misinterpretations.
First, we identified reports of lesion-associated reduplicative paramnesias with brain images available through a systematic review of the literature (n = 24). Each lesion was matched with 4 stroke controls and the sample was randomly split in an exploratory (n = 60) and in a validation (n = 60) dataset. Second, we used 178 7T tractographies to compute structural disconnectome maps and analysed lesion topography and disconnection patterns. Delusions of space were significantly associated with structural disconnection of right ventrolateral prefrontal and right temporal regions, and this finding was replicated in the validation sample. Third, we performed a functional meta-analysis of syndrome-related terms. We demonstrated that the structural disconnectomes of delusions of space were spatially correlated with the functional meta-analytic maps of familiarity and place, and replicated the previous evidence that the lesion topography maps are spatially correlated with belief-related functional networks. No association was found with control terms.; These results reveal that structural disconnection putatively mediates functional changes associated with reduplicative paramnesias and provide a possible neural basis for the content specificity for places that characterizes these delusional beliefs.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The fiber tracts of the cerebrum may be a more important determinant of resection limits than the cortex. Better knowledge of the 3-dimensional (3-D) anatomic organization of the fiber pathways is important in planning safe and accurate surgery for lesions within the cerebrum.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the topographic anatomy of fiber tracts and subcortical gray matter of the human cerebrum and their relationships with consistent cortical, ventricular, and nuclear landmarks.; METHODS: Twenty-five formalin-fixed human brains and 4 whole cadaveric heads were examined by fiber dissection technique and x6 to x40 magnification. The fiber tracts and central core structures, including the insula and basal ganglia, were examined and their relationships captured in 3-D photography. The depth between the surface of the cortical gyri and selected fiber tracts was measured.; RESULTS: The topographic relationships of the important association, projection, and commissural fasciculi within the cerebrum and superficial cortical landmarks were identified. Important landmarks with consistent relationships to the fiber tracts were the cortical gyri and sulci, limiting sulci of the insula, nuclear masses in the central core, and lateral ventricles. The fiber tracts were also organized in a consistent pattern in relation to each other. The anatomic findings are briefly compared with functional data from clinicoradiological analysis and intraoperative stimulation of fiber tracts.; CONCLUSION: An understanding of the 3-D anatomic organization of the fiber tracts of the brain is essential in planning safe and accurate cerebral surgery.

N2  -  Objectives: The ability of voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) to define the functional anatomy of the human brain has not been fully assessed. With a view to assessing VLSM's validity, the present study analyzed the technique's ability to determine the known clinical-anatomic correlates of hemiparesis in stroke patients.
Design: Lesions (damaged in at least 5 patients) associated with transformed limb motor score (after adjustment on lesion volume) at 6 months were examined in 272 patients using VLSM. The value of additional multivariable linear, logistic and Bayesian analyses was examined.; Results: We first checked that motor hemiparesis was fully accounted for by corticospinal tract (CST) lesions (sensitivity = 100%; p = 0.0001). Conventional VLSM analysis flagged up 2 regions corresponding to the CST, but also 8 regions located outside the CST. All 10 brain regions achieving statistical significance in the VLSM analysis were submitted to 3 additional analyses. The backward linear regression analysis selected 5 regions, one only corresponding to the CST (R-2 : 0.03, p = 0.0008). The logistic regression analysis selected correctly the CST (OR: 2.39, 95%CI: 1.44-3.96; 0.001). The Bayesian network analysis selected regions including the CST (in 92% of 3000 bootstrap replications) and identified the source of multicollinearity. These lesions evaluated by structural equation modeling resulted in an excellent fit (p-value = 0.228, chidf = 1.19, RMSEA = 0.032, CFI = 0.999). Analyses of confusion factors showed that conventional VLSM analyses were strongly influenced by lesion frequency (R-2 = 0.377; p = 0.0001) and multicollinearity.; Conclusions: Conventional VLSM analyses are sensitive but weakened by a type I error due to the combined effects of multicollinearity and lesion frequency. We demonstrate that the addition of a Bayesian network analysis, and to a lesser extent of logistic regression, controlled for this type I error and constituted a reliable means of defining the functional anatomy of the motor system in stroke patients.

N2  -  Introduction: Tractography has demonstrated utility for surgical resection in the setting of primary brain tumors involving eloquent white matter (WM) pathways.
Methods: Twelve patients with glioma in or near eloquent motor areas were analyzed. The motor status was recorded before and after surgery. Two different tractography approaches were used to generate the motor corticospinal tract (CST): Constrained spherical deconvolution probabilistic tractography (CSD-Prob) and single tensor deterministic tractography (Tens-DET). To define the degree of disruption of the CST after surgical resection of the tumor, we calculated the percentage of the CST affected by surgical resection, which was then correlated with the postoperative motor status. Moreover, the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of the CST generated by the CSD-Prob and the Tens-DET was measured and compared between the ipsilesional and contralesional side.; Results: The CST was identified in all patients and its trajectory was displaced by the tumor. Only the CSD-Prob approach showed the CST with the characteristic fan-like projections from the precentral gyrus to the brainstem. Disruption of the CST was identified in 66 with postoperative motor deficit by CSD-Prob approach and in 56 in the Tens-DET. The degree of disruption was significantly associated with the motor deficit with the CSD-Prob approach (rho = -0.88, p = 0.021). However, with the Tens-DET approach the CST disruption did not show significant association with the motor function (rho = -0.27, p = 0.6). There was a significant decrease in FA (p = 0.006) and a significant increase in MD (p = 0.0004) and RD (p = 0.005) on the ipsilesional CST compared with the contralesional CST only with the CSD-Prob approach.; Conclusion: CSD-Prob accurately represented the known anatomy of the CST and provided a meaningful estimate of microstructural changes of the CST affected by the tumor and its macrostructural damage after surgery. Newer surgical planning stations should include advanced models and algorithms of tractography in order to obtain more meaningful reconstructions of the WM pathways during glioma surgery.

N2  -  Significance: The use of diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) has shown efficacy in research studies as a technique capable of noninvasively monitoring blood flow in tissue with applications in neuromonitoring, exercise science, and breast cancer management. The ability of DCS to resolve blood flow in these tissues is related to the optical sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurements, which in some cases, particularly adult cerebral blood flow measurements, is inadequate in a significant portion of the population. Improvements to DCS sensitivity and SNR could allow for greater clinical translation of this technique.
Aim: Interferometric diffuse correlation spectroscopy (iDCS) was characterized and compared to traditional homodyne DCS to determine possible benefits of utilizing heterodyne detection.; Approach: An iDCS system was constructed by modifying a homodyne DCS system with fused fiber couplers to create a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Comparisons between homodyne and heterodyne detection were performed using an intralipid phantom characterized at two extended source-detector separations (2.4, 3.6 cm), different photon count rates, and a range of reference arm power levels. Characterization of the iDCS signal mixing was compared to theory. Precision of the estimation of the diffusion coefficient and SNR of the autocorrelation curve were compared between different measurement conditions that mimicked what would be seen in vivo.; Results: The mixture of signals present in the heterodyne autocorrelation function was found to agree with the derived theory and resulted in accurate measurement of the diffusion coefficient of the phantom. Improvement of the SNR of the autocorrelation curve up to similar to 2x and up to 80% reduction in the variability of the diffusion coefficient fit were observed for all measurement cases as a function of increased reference arm power.; Conclusions: iDCS has the potential to improve characterization of blood flow in tissue at extended source-detector separations, enhancing depth sensitivity and SNR.

N2  -  Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) isotropic map (p-map) with current radiographically (T-2/T-2-FLAIR) methods based on abnormal hyper-signal size and location of glioblastoma tumor using a semi-automatic approach.
Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients with biopsy-proved diagnosis of glioblastoma participated in this study. T-2, T-2-FLAIR images and diffusion tensor imaging (DT) were acquired 1 week before radiotherapy. Hyper-signal regions on T-2, T-2-FLAIR and DTI p-map were segmented by means of semi-automated segmentation. Manual segmentation was used as ground truth. Dice Scores (DS) were calculated for validation of semiautomatic method. Discordance Index (DI) and area difference percentage between the three above regions from the three modalities were calculated for each patient.; Results: Area of abnormality in the p-map was smaller than the corresponding areas in the T-2 and T-2-FLAIR images in 17 patients; with mean difference percentage of 30 +- 0.15 and 35 +- 0.15, respectively. Abnormal region in the p-map was larger than the corresponding areas in the T-2-FLAIR and T-2 images in 4 patients; with mean difference percentage of 26 +- 0.17 and 29 +- 0.28, respectively. This region in the p-map was larger than the one in the T-2 image and smaller than the one in the T-2-FLAIR image in 3 patients; with mean difference percentage of 34 +- 0.08 and 27 +- 0.06, respectively. Lack of concordance was observed ranged from 0214-0.772 for T-2-FLAIRp-map (average: 0.462 +- 0.18), 0. 266-0.794 for T-2p-map (average: 0.468 +- 0.13) and 0.123-0.776 for T-2T-2-FLAIR (average: 0.423 +- 0.2). These regions on three modalities were segmented using a semi-automatic segmentation method with over 86% sensitivity, 90% specificity and 89% dice score for three modalities.; Conclusion: It is noted that T-2, T-2-FLAIR and DTI p-maps represent different but complementary information for delineation of glioblastoma tumor margins. Therefore, this study suggests DTI p-map modality as a candidate to improve target volume delineation based on conventional modalities, which needs further investigations with follow-up data to be confirmed.

N2  -  Optimal performance in any task relies on the ability to detect and correct errors. The anterior cingulate cortex and the broader posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) are active during error processing. However, it is unclear whether damage to the pMFC impairs error monitoring. We hypothesized that successful error monitoring critically relies on connections between the pMFC and broader cortical networks involved in executive functions and the task being monitored. We tested this hypothesis in the context of speech error monitoring in people with post-stroke aphasia. Diffusion weighted images were collected in 51 adults with chronic left-hemisphere stroke and 37 age-matched control participants. Whole-brain connectomes were derived using constrained spherical deconvolution and anatomically-constrained probabilistic tractography. Support vector regressions identified white matter connections in which lost integrity in stroke survivors related to reduced error detection during confrontation naming. Lesioned connections to the bilateral pMFC were related to reduce error monitoring, including many connections to regions associated with speech production and executive function. We conclude that connections to the pMFC support error monitoring. Error monitoring in speech production is supported by the structural connectivity between the pMFC and regions involved in speech production, comprehension, and executive function. Interactions between pMFC and other task-relevant processors may similarly be critical for error monitoring in other task contexts.

N2  -  Simple Summary This study investigated the role of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and frontotemporoparietal network in executive functions. The results demonstrated that neither structural and network overlap nor network disconnection predictors explained executive dysfunction in 156 presurgical IDH-mutated low-grade glioma patients. We specifically looked for features that explain executive dysfunction prior to surgery, both at the level of the individual branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (distance to glioma; integrity of tracts) as well as at the network level (via disconnection analyses) with data pooled from two neurosurgical centers. Contrary to our expectations, no predictors were found. We believe it is important to share these null results. It is of interest to neurologists, neurosurgeons, and clinical neuroscientists to know that there is no straightforward topographical explanation of executive dysfunction in presurgical low-grade glioma patients and that we need to develop novel methods to unveil the complex underlying mechanisms. We extensively discuss possible explanations for our findings and suggest how to proceed from here. Executive dysfunctions have a high prevalence in low-grade glioma patients and may be the result of structural disconnections of particular subcortical tracts and/or networks. However, little research has focused on preoperative low-grade glioma patients. The frontotemporoparietal network has been closely linked to executive functions and is substantiated by the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The aim of this study was to investigate their role in executive functions in low-grade glioma patients. Patients from two neurological centers were included with IDH-mutated low-grade gliomas. The sets of preoperative predictors were (i) distance between the tumor and superior longitudinal fasciculus, (ii) structural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, (iii) overlap between tumor and cortical networks, and (iv) white matter disconnection of the same networks. Linear regression and random forest analyses were performed. The group of 156 patients demonstrated significantly lower performance than normative samples and had a higher prevalence of executive impairments. However, both regression and random forest analyses did not demonstrate significant results, meaning that neither structural, cortical network overlap, nor network disconnection predictors explained executive performance. Overall, our null results indicate that there is no straightforward topographical explanation of executive performance in low-grade glioma patients. We extensively discuss possible explanations, including plasticity-induced network-level equipotentiality. Finally, we stress the need for the development of novel methods to unveil the complex and interacting mechanisms that cause executive deficits in low-grade glioma patients.

N2  -  The importance of preserving function during glioma surgery cannot be overemphasized. There are a number of techniques utilized including functional MRI, direct electro-physiological monitoring and functional neuronavigation to maximize and safely resect gliomas. The intraoperative MRI is an extremely valuable tool and adds to the neurosurgeon's armamentarium. Combining these technologies will enhance the safety and efficacy of glioma surgery. This is the first report in the literature where we successfully combine both functional neuronavigation and subcortical stimulation, using a single probe to safely resect a recurrent glioblastoma.

N2  -  Advances in deep learning can be applied to acute stroke imaging to build powerful and explainable prediction models that could supersede traditionally used biomarkers. We aimed to evaluate the performance and interpretability of a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting long-term functional outcome with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquired at day 1 post-stroke. Ischemic stroke patients (n = 322) were included from the ASTER and INSULINFARCT trials as well as the Pitie-Salpetriere registry. We trained a CNN to predict long-term functional outcome assessed at 3 months with the modified Rankin Scale (dichotomized as good [mRS <= 2] vs. poor [mRS >= 3]) and compared its performance to two logistic regression models using lesion volume and ASPECTS. The CNN contained an attention mechanism, which allowed to visualize the areas of the brain that drove prediction. The deep learning model yielded a significantly higher area under the curve (0.83 95%CI [0.78-0.87]) than lesion volume (0.78 [0.73-0.83]) and ASPECTS (0.77 [0.71-0.83]) (p < 0.05). Setting all classifiers to the specificity as the deep learning model (i.e., 0.87 [0.82-0.92]), the CNN yielded a significantly higher sensitivity (0.67 [0.59-0.73]) than lesion volume (0.48 [0.40-0.56]) and ASPECTS (0.50 [0.41-0.58]) (p = 0.002). The attention mechanism revealed that the network learned to naturally attend to the lesion to predict outcome.

N2  -  In order to preserve postoperative language function, we recently proposed a new intraoperative method to monitor the integrity of the dorsal language pathway (arcuate fasciculus; AF) using cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs). Based on further investigations (20 patients, 21 CCEP investigations), including patients who were not suitable for awake surgery (five CCEP investigations) or those without preoperative neuroimaging data (eight CCEP investigations including four with untraceable tractography due to brain edema), we attempted to clarify the clinical impact of this new intraoperative method. We monitored the integrity of AF by stimulating the anterior perisylvian language area (AL) by recording CCEPs from the posterior perisylvian language area (PL) consecutively during both general anesthesia and awake condition. After tumor resection, single-pulse electrical stimuli were also applied to the floor of the removal cavity to record subcortico-cortical evoked potentials (SCEPs) at AL and PL in 12 patients (12 SCEP investigations). We demonstrated that (1) intraoperative dorsal language network monitoring was feasible even when patients were not suitable for awake surgery or without preoperative neuroimaging studies, (2) CCEP is a dynamic marker of functional connectivity or integrity of AF, and CCEP N1 amplitude could even become larger after reduction of brain edema, (3) a 50% CCEP N1 amplitude decline might be a cut-off value to prevent permanent language dysfunction due to impairment of AF, (4) a correspondence (<2.0 ms difference) of N1 onset latencies between CCEP and the sum of SCEPs indicates close proximity of the subcortical stimulus site to AF (<3.0 mm).

N2  -  Klepzig et al. reported impairment in recognition of the facial expression of fear and anger in patients with left insula damage caused by stroke. Decreased white-matter integrity of tracts reaching from the left insula in these patients was associated with a reduced recognition of fear and anger expressions.
The role of the human insula in facial emotion recognition is controversially discussed, especially in relation to lesion-location-dependent impairment following stroke. In addition, structural connectivity quantification of important white-matter tracts that link the insula to impairments in facial emotion recognition has not been investigated. In a case-control study, we investigated a group of 29 stroke patients in the chronic stage and 14 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. Lesion location of stroke patients was analysed with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In addition, structural white-matter integrity for tracts between insula regions and their primarily known interconnected brain structures was quantified by tractography-based fractional anisotropy. Our behavioural analyses showed that stroke patients were impaired in the recognition of fearful, angry and happy but not disgusted expressions. Voxel-based lesion mapping revealed that especially lesions centred around the left anterior insula were associated with impaired recognition of emotional facial expressions. The structural integrity of insular white-matter connectivity was decreased for the left hemisphere and impaired recognition accuracy for angry and fearful expressions was associated with specific left-sided insular tracts. Taken together, these findings suggest that a multimodal investigation of structural alterations has the potential to deepen our understanding of emotion recognition impairments after stroke.

N2  -  Background and objective: Stroke is the second most deadly disease globally and seriously endangers people's lives and health. The automatic detection of stroke lesions from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can improve the diagnosis. Recently, automatic detection methods based on YOLOv5 have been utilized in medical images. However, most of them barely capture the stroke lesions because of their small size and fuzzy boundaries.Methods: To address this problem, a novel method for tracing the edge of the stroke lesion based on YOLOv5 (TE-YOLOv5) is proposed. Specifically, we constantly update the high-level features of the lesion using an aggregate pool (AP) module. Conversely, we feed the extracted feature into the reverse attention (RA) module to trace the edge relationship promptly. Overall, 1681 DWI images of 319 stroke patients have been collected, and experi-enced radiologists have marked the lesions. DWI images were randomly split into the training and test set at a ratio of 8:2. TE-YOLOv5 has been compared with the related models, and a detailed ablation analysis has been conducted to clarify the role of the RA and AP modules.Results: TE-YOLOv5 outperforms its counterparts and achieves competitive performance with a precision of 81.5%, a recall of 75.8%, and a mAP@0.5 of 80.7% (mean average precision while the intersection over union is 0.5) under the same backbone. At the patient level, the positive finding rate can reach 98.51%, while the con-fidence is set at 80.0%. After ablating RA, the mAP@0.5 decreases to 79.6%; after ablating RA and AP, the mAP@0.5 decreases to 78.1%.Conclusions: The proposed TE-YOLOv5 can automatically and effectively detect stroke lesions from DWI images, especially for those with an extremely small size and blurred boundaries. AP and RA modules can aggregate multi-layer high-level features and concurrently track the edge relationship of stroke lesions. These detection methods might help radiologists improve stroke diagnosis and have great application potential in clinical practice.

N2  -  BrainX(3) is a large-scale simulation of human brain activity with real-time interaction, rendered in 3D in a virtual reality environment, which combines computational power with human intuition for the exploration and analysis of complex dynamical networks. We ground this simulation on structural connectivity obtained from diffusion spectrum imaging data and model it on neuronal population dynamics. Users can interact with BrainX(3) in real-time by perturbing brain regions with transient stimulations to observe reverberating network activity, simulate lesion dynamics or implement network analysis functions from a library of graph theoretic measures. BrainX(3) can thus be used as a novel immersive platform for exploration and analysis of dynamical activity patterns in brain networks, both at rest or in a task-related state, for discovery of signaling pathways associated to brain function and/or dysfunction and as a tool for virtual neurosurgery. Our results demonstrate these functionalities and shed insight on the dynamics of the resting-state attractor. Specifically, we found that a noisy network seems to favor a low firing attractor state. We also found that the dynamics of a noisy network is less resilient to lesions. Our simulations on TMS perturbations show that even though TMS inhibits most of the network, it also sparsely excites a few regions. This is presumably due to anti-correlations in the dynamics and suggests that even a lesioned network can show sparsely distributed increased activity compared to healthy resting-state, over specific brain areas.

N2  -  Functional neuroimaging and brain lesion studies demonstrate that secondary motor areas of the frontal lobe play a crucial role in the cortical control of hand movements. However, no study so far has examined frontal white matter connections of the secondary motor network, namely the frontal aslant tract, connecting the supplementary motor complex and the posterior inferior frontal regions, and the U-shaped dorsal and ventral premotor fibers running through the middle frontal gyrus. The aim of the current study is to explore the involvement of the short frontal lobe connections in reaching and reach-to-grasp movements in 32 right-handed healthy subjects by correlating tractography data based on spherical deconvolution approach with kinematical data. We showed that individual differences in the microstructure of the bilateral frontal aslant tract, bilateral ventral and left dorsal premotor tracts were associated with kinematic features of hand actions. Furthermore, bilateral ventral premotor connections were also involved in the closing grip phase necessary for determining efficient and stable grasping of the target object. This work suggests for the first time that hand kinematics and visuomotor processing are associated with the anatomy of the short frontal lobe connections.

N2  -  IntroductionInsular gliomas have complex anatomy and microvascular supply that make resection difficult. Furthermore, resection of insular glioma is associated with a significant risk of postoperative ischemic complications. Thus, this study aimed to assess the incidence of ischemic complications related to insular glioma resection, determine its risk factors, and describe a single surgeon's experience of artery-preserving tumor resection. MethodsWe enrolled 75 consecutive patients with insular gliomas who underwent transcortical tumor resection. Preoperative and postoperative demographic, clinical, radiological [including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)], intraoperative neurophysiological data, and functional outcomes were analyzed. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and radiological characteristics like the relationship between the proximal segment of the lateral lenticulostriate arteries (LLSAs) and the tumor, the flat inner edge sign (the inner edge of the insular glioma is well-defined) or obscure inner edge sign, the distance between the lesion and posterior limb of the internal capsule and the invasion of the superior limiting sulcus by the tumor were analyzed. Strategies such as "residual triangle," "basal ganglia outline reappearance," and "sculpting" technique were used to preserve the LLSAs and the main branches of M2 for maximal tumor resection according to the Berger-Sinai classification. ResultsPostoperative DWI showed acute ischemia in 44 patients (58.7%). Moreover, nine patients (12%) had developed new motor deficits, as determined by the treating neurosurgeons. The flat inner edge sign [odds ratio (OR), 0.144; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.024-0.876) and MEPs (>50%) (OR, 18.182; 95% CI, 3.311-100.00) were significantly associated with postoperative core ischemia, which affected the posterior limb of the internal capsule or corona radiata. ConclusionsInsular glioma resection was associated with a high incidence of ischemia, as detected by DWI, as well as new motor deficits that were determined by the treating neurosurgeons. Insular glioma patients with obscure inner edge signs and intraoperative MEPs decline >50% had a higher risk of developing core ischemia. With our strategies, maximal safe resection of insular gliomas may be achieved.

N2  -  White matter tractography mapping is an important tool for neuro-surgical planning and navigation. It relies on the accurate manual delineation of anatomical seeding ROIs (sROIs) by neuroanatomy experts. Stringent pre-operative time-constraints and limited availability of experts suggest that automation tools are strongly needed for the task. In this article, we propose and compare several multi-modal fully convolutional network architectures for segmentation of sROIs. Inspired by their manual segmentation practice, anatomical information from T1w maps is fused by the network with directionally encoded color (DEC) maps to compute the segmentation. Qualitative and quantitative validation was performed on image data from 75 real tumor resection candidates for the sROIs of the motor tract, the arcuate fasciculus, and optic radiation. Favorable comparison was also obtained with state-of-the-art methods for the tumor dataset as well as the ISMRM 2017 traCED challenge dataset. The proposed networks showed promising results, indicating they may significantly improve the efficiency of pre-surgical tractography mapping, without compromising its quality.

N2  -  A new quantitative method has been developed for real-time mapping of temperature changes induced by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), It is based on the temperature dependence of the T-1 relaxation time and the equilibrium magnetization, To calibrate the temperature measurement, the functional relationship between T-1 and temperature was examined in different samples of porcine muscle and fatty tissue. The method was validated by a comparison of calculated temperature maps with fiber-optic measurements in heated muscle tissue. The experiment showed that the accuracy of the MR method for temperature measurements is better than 1 degrees C, Since the acquisition time of the employed MR sequence Lakes only 3 s per slice and the calculation of the temperature map can be performed within seconds, the imaging technique works nearly in real-time. The temperature measurement could be realized during HIFU showing no disturbances by ultrasound sonication. In comparison to other MR approaches, the advantages of the introduced method lie in a sufficient accuracy and time resolution combined with a reasonable robustness against motion as well as the feasibility for temperature monitoring in fatty tissues.

N2  -  Object. To prevent speech disturbances after Gamma Knife surgery (GKS), the authors integrated arcuate fasciculus (AF) tractography based on diffusion tensor (DT) MR imaging into treatment planning for GKS.
Methods. Arcuate fasciculus tractography was retrospectively integrated into planning that had been previously performed by neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists. This technique was retrospectively applied to 12 patients with arteriovenous malformations adjacent to the AF. Diffusion tensor images were acquired before the frame was affixed to the patient's head and DT tractography images of the AF were created using the authors' original software. The data from DT tractography and stereotactic 3D imaging studies obtained after frame fixation were transported to a treatment planning workstation for GKS and coregistered so that the delivered doses and incidence of posttreatment aphasia could be assessed.; Results. The AF could not be depicted in 2 patients who initially presented with motor aphasia caused by hemorrhaging from arteriovenous malformations. During the median follow-up period of 29 months after GKS, aphasia developed in 2 patients: 30 Gy delivered to the frontal portion of the AF caused conduction aphasia in 1 patient, and 9.6 Gy to the temporal portion led to motor aphasia in the other. Speech dysfunction was not observed after a maximum radiation dose of 10.0-16.8 Gy was delivered to the frontal fibers in 4 patients, and 3.6-5.2 Gy to the temporal fibers in 3.; Conclusions. The authors found that administration of a 10-Gy radiation dose during GKS was tolerated in the frontal but not the temporal fibers of the AF. The authors recommend confirmation of the dose by integration of AF tractography with GKS, especially in lesions located near the temporal language fibers. (DOI: 10.31712008.4.17521)

N2  -  The concept of functional localization within the brain and the associated risk of resecting these areas during removal of infiltrating tumors, such as diffuse gliomas, are well established in neurosurgery. Global efficiency (GE) is a graph theory concept that can be used to simulate connectome disruption following tumor resection. Structural connectivity graphs were created from diffusion tractography obtained from the brains of 80 healthy adults. These graphs were then used to simulate parcellation resection in every gross anatomical region of the cerebrum by identifying every possible combination of adjacent nodes in a graph and then measuring the drop in GE following nodal deletion. Progressive removal of brain parcellations led to patterns of GE decline that were reasonably predictable but had inter-subject differences. Additionally, as expected, there were deletion of some nodes that were worse than others. However, in each lobe examined in every subject, some deletion combinations were worse for GE than removing a greater number of nodes in a different region of the brain. Among certain patients, patterns of common nodes which exhibited worst GE upon removal were identified as "connectotypes". Given some evidence in the literature linking GE to certain aspects of neuro-cognitive abilities, investigating these connectotypes could potentially mitigate the impact of brain surgery on cognition.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The cingulum bundle (CB) has long been a target for psychiatric neurosurgical procedures, but with limited understanding of the brain networks being impacted. Recent advances in human tractography could provide a foundation to better understand the effects of neurosurgical interventions on the CB; however, the reliability of tractography remains in question.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of different tractography techniques, derived from typical, human diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data, to characterize CB connectivity described in animal models. This will help validate the clinical applicability of tractography, and generate insight on current and future neurosurgical targets for psychiatric disorders.; METHODS: Connectivity of the CB in 15 healthy human subjects was evaluated using DWI-based tractography, and compared to tract-tracing findings from nonhuman primates. Brain regions of interest were defined to coincide with the animal model. Tractography was performed using 3 techniques (FSL probabilistic, Camino probabilistic, and Camino deterministic). Differences in connectivity were assessed, and the CB segment with the greatest connectivity was determined.; RESULTS: Each tractography technique successfully reproduced the animal tracing model with a mean accuracy of 72% (68-75%, P < .05). Additionally, one region of the CB, the rostral dorsal segment, had significantly greater connectivity to associated brain structures than all other CB segments (P < .05).; CONCLUSION: Noninvasive, in vivo human analysis of the CB, using clinically available DWI for tractography, consistently reproduced the results of an animal tract-tracing model. This suggests that tractography of the CB can be used for clinical applications, which may aid in neurosurgical targeting for psychiatric disorders.

N2  -  Gliomas are one of the most common primary central nervous system tumors, and surgical treatment remains the principal role in the management of any grade of gliomas. In this study, based on the introduction of gliomas, we review the novel surgical techniques and technologies in support of the extent of resection to achieve long-term disease control and summarize the findings on how to keep the balance between cytoreduction and neurological morbidity from a list of literature searched. With modern neurosurgical techniques, gliomas resection can be safely performed with low morbidity and extraordinary long-term functional outcomes.

N2  -  Simple Summary To optimise patient outcomes in tumour surgery in visual eloquent areas, it is crucial to preserve the integrity of the visual pathways. The aim of our prospective study is to examine the use of visual evoked potentials (VEPs), utilising different techniques such as transcranial and direct cortical recording. In a cohort of 39 patients, we established a significant correlation between the infiltration of the optic radiation by the tumour on tractography and the occurrence of visual field deficits after surgery. In contrast to the transcranial recordings, direct cortical VEP recordings exhibited a robust correlation with visual outcomes. Lastly, a 40% decrease in the amplitude of the N75 and P100 waves of the direct cortical recordings was associated with the risk of a worsening visual outcome. VEP monitoring can be a reliable method to detect visual deficits, but there is a need to improve the technique as it is prone to false warnings. Brain tumour surgery in visual eloquent areas poses significant challenges to neurosurgeons and has reported inconsistent results. This is a single-centre prospective cohort study of patients admitted for asleep surgery of intra-axial lesions in visual eloquent areas. Demographic and clinical information, data from tractography and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) monitoring were recorded and correlated with visual outcomes. Thirty-nine patients were included (20 females, 19 males; mean age 52.51 & PLUSMN; 14.08 years). Diffuse intrinsic glioma was noted in 61.54% of patients. There was even distribution between the temporal, occipital and parietal lobes, while 55.26% were right hemispheric lesions. Postoperatively, 74.4% remained stable in terms of visual function, 23.1% deteriorated and 2.6% improved. The tumour infiltration of the optic radiation on tractography was significantly related to the visual field deficit after surgery (p = 0.016). Higher N75 (p = 0.036) and P100 (p = 0.023) amplitudes at closure on direct cortical VEP recordings were associated with no new postoperative visual deficit. A threshold of 40% deterioration of the N75 (p = 0.035) and P100 (p = 0.020) amplitudes correlated with a risk of visual field deterioration. To conclude, direct cortical VEP recordings demonstrated a strong correlation with visual outcomes, contrary to transcranial recordings. Invasion of the optic radiation is related to worse visual field outcomes.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Herein, the authors report their experience with intraoperative stimulation mapping to locate the descending subcortical motor pathways in patients undergoing surgery for hemispheric gliomas within or adjacent to the rolandic cortex, with particular description of the morbidity and functional outcomes associated with this technique.
METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of patients who, in the period between 1997 and 2016, had undergone resection of hemispheric perirolandic gliomas within or adjacent to descending motor pathways. Data regarding intraoperative stimulation mapping and patient postoperative neurological status were collected.; RESULTS Of 702 patients, stimulation mapping identified the descending motor pathways in 300 cases (43%). A new or worsened motor deficit was seen postoperatively in 210 cases (30%). Among these 210 cases, there was improvement in motor function to baseline levels by 3 months postoperatively in 161 cases (77%), whereas the deficit remained in 49 cases (23%). The majority (65%) of long-term deficits (persisting beyond 3 months) were mild or moderate (antigravity strength or better). On multivariate analysis, patients in whom the subcortical motor pathways had been identified with stimulation mapping during surgery were more likely to develop an additional andor worsened motor deficit postoperatively than were those in whom the subcortical pathways had not been found (45% vs 19%, respectively, p < 0.001). This difference remained when considering the likelihood of a long-term deficit (i.e., persisting > 3 months; 12% vs 3.2%, p < 0.001). A higher tumor grade and the presence of a preoperative motor deficit were also associated with higher rates of motor deficits persisting long-term. A region of restricted diffusion adjacent to the resection cavity was seen in 20 patients with long-term deficits (41%) and was more common in cases in which the motor pathways were not identified (69%). Long-term deficits that occur in settings in which the subcortical motor pathways are not identified seem in large part due to ischemic injury to descending tracts.; CONCLUSIONS Stimulation mapping allows surgeons to identify the descending motor pathways during resection of tumors in perirolandic regions and to attain an acceptable rate of morbidity in these high-risk cases.

N2  -  Alexia is common in the context of aphasia. It is widely agreed that damage to phonological and semantic systems not specific to reading causes co-morbid alexia and aphasia. Studies of alexia to date have only examined phonology and semantics as singular processes or axes of impairment, typically in the context of stereotyped alexia syndromes. However, phonology, in particular, is known to rely on subprocesses, including sensory-phonological processing, motor-phonological processing, and sensory-motor integration. Moreover, many people with stroke aphasia demonstrate mild or mixed patterns of reading impairment that do not fit neatly with one syndrome. This cross-sectional study tested whether the hallmark symptom of phonological reading impairment, the lexicality effect, emerges from damage to a specific subprocess of phonology in stroke patients not selected for alexia syndromes. Participants were 30 subjects with left-hemispheric stroke and 37 age- and education-matched controls. A logistic mixed-effects model tested whether post-stroke impairments in sensory phonology, motor phonology, or sensory-motor integration modulated the effect of item lexicality on patient accuracy in reading aloud. Support vector regression voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping localized brain regions necessary for reading and non-orthographic phonological processing. Additionally, a novel support vector regression structural connectome-symptom mapping method identified the contribution of both lesioned and spared but disconnected, brain regions to reading accuracy and non-orthographic phonological processing. Specifically, we derived whole-brain structural connectornes using constrained spherical deconvolution-based probabilistic tractography and identified lesioned connections based on comparisons between patients and controls. Logistic mixed-effects regression revealed that only greater motorphonological impairment related to lower accuracy reading aloud pseudowords versus words. Impaired sensory-motor integration was related to lower overall accuracy in reading aloud. No relationship was identified between sensory-phonological impairment and reading accuracy. Voxel-based and structural connectome lesion-symptom mapping revealed that lesioned and disconnected left ventral precentral gyrus related to both greater motor-phonological impairment and lower sublexical reading accuracy. In contrast, lesioned and disconnected left temporoparietal cortex is related to both impaired sensory-motor integration and reduced overall reading accuracy. These results clarify that at least two dissociable phonological processes contribute to the pattern of reading impairment in aphasia. First, impaired sensory-motor integration, caused by lesions disrupting the left temporoparietal cortex and its structural connections, non-selectively reduces accuracy in reading aloud. Second, impaired motor-phonological processing, caused at least partially by lesions disrupting left ventral premotor cortex and structural connections, selectively reduces sublexical reading accuracy. These results motivate a revised cognitive model of reading aloud that incorporates a sensory-motor phonological circuit.

N2  -  Objective Patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) may exhibit corpus callosal atrophy and tissue alterations. Measuring the callosal volume and tissue integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could help to differentiate patients with NPSLE from patients without NPSLE. Hence, this study aimed to use an automatic cell-competition algorithm to segment the corpus callosum and to investigate the effects of central nervous system (CNS) involvement on the callosal volume and tissue integrity in patients with SLE.
Methods Twenty-two SLE patients with (N = 10, NPSLE) and without (N = 12, non-NPSLE) CNS involvement and 22 control subjects were enrolled in this study. For volumetric measurement, a cell-competition algorithm was used to automatically delineate corpus callosal boundaries based on a midsagittal fractional anisotropy (FA) map. After obtaining corpus callosal boundaries for all subjects, the volume, FA, and mean diffusivity (MD) of the corpus callosum were calculated. A post hoc Tamhane's T2 analysis was performed to statistically compare differences among NPSLE, non-NPSLE, and control subjects. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed to compare the performance of the volume, FA, and MD of the corpus callosum in differentiating NPSLE from other subjects.; Results Patients with NPSLE had significant decreases in volume and FA but an increase in MD in the corpus callosum compared with control subjects, whereas no significant difference was noted between patients without NPSLE and control subjects. The FA was found to have better performance in differentiating NPSLE from other subjects.; Conclusions A cell-competition algorithm could be used to automatically evaluate callosal atrophy and tissue alterations. Assessments of the corpus callosal volume and tissue integrity helped to demonstrate the effects of CNS involvement in patients with SLE.

N2  -  We aim to identify specific areas of white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM), which predict disability progression and cognitive dysfunction after five years in patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Thirty-two patients with early PPMS were assessed at baseline and after five years on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and EDSS step-changes were calculated. At year five, a subgroup of 25 patients and 31 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological assessment. Baseline imaging consisted of dual-echo (proton density and T2-weighted), T1-weighted volumetric, and diffusion tensor imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were created, and fed into tract-based spatial statistics. To compensate for the potential bias introduced by WM lesions, the T1 volumes underwent a lesion-filling procedure before entering a voxel-based morphometry protocol. To investigate whether FA and GM volume predicted EDSS step-changes over five years and neuropsychological tests scores at five years, voxelwise linear regression analyses were performed. Lower FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) predicted a greater progression of disability over the follow-up. Lower FA along the entire CC predicted worse verbal memory, attention and speed of information processing, and executive function at five years. GM baseline volume did not predict any clinical variable. Our findings highlight the importance of damage to the interhemispheric callosal pathways in determining physical and cognitive disability in PPMS. Disruption of these pathways, which interconnect motor and cognitive networks between the two hemispheres, may result in a disconnection syndrome that contributes to long-term physical and cognitive disability.

N2  -  The aim of this study is to investigate the trajectory of medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and explore its anatomical relationship with the oculomotor nerve using tractography technique. The MLF and oculomotor nerve were reconstructed at the same time with preset three region of interests (ROIs): one set at the area of rostral midbrain, one placed on the MLF area at the upper pons, and one placed at the cisternal part of the oculomotor nerve. This mapping protocol was tested in an HCP-1065 template, 35 health subjects from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), 20 healthy adults and 6 brainstem cavernous malformation (BCM) patients with generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI)-based tractography. Finally, the 200 mu m brainstem template from Center for In Vivo Microscopy, Duke University (Duke CIVM), was used to validate the trajectory of reconstructed MLF. The MLF and oculomotor nerve were reconstructed in the HCP-1065 template, 35 MGH health subjects, 20 healthy adults and 6 BCM patients. The MLF was in conjunction with the ipsilateral mesencephalic part of the oculomotor nerve. The displacement of MLF was identified in all BCM patients. Decreased QA, RDI and FA were found in the MLF of lesion side, indicating axonal loss and/or edema of displaced MLF. The reconstructed MLF in Duke CIVM brainstem 200 mu m template corresponded well with histological anatomy. The MLF and oculomotor nerve were visualized accurately with our protocol using GQI-based fiber tracking. This GQI-based tractography is an important tool in the reconstruction and evaluation of MLF.

N2  -  The existence of shoulder abduction and finger extension movement capacity shortly after stroke onset is an important prognostic factor, indicating favorable functional outcomes for the hemiparetic upper limb (HUL). Here, we asked whether variation in lesion topography affects these two movements similarly or distinctly and whether lesion impact is similar or distinct for left and right hemisphere damage. Shoulder abduction and finger extension movements were examined in 77 chronic post-stroke patients using relevant items of the Fugl-Meyer test. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left and right hemispheric damage patient groups, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In the left hemispheric damage group, shoulder abduction and finger extension were affected only by damage to the corticospinal tract in its passage through the corona radiata. In contrast, following the right hemispheric damage, these two movements were affected not only by corticospinal tract damage but also by damage to white matter association tracts, the putamen, and the insular cortex. In both groups, voxel clusters have been found where damage affected shoulder abduction and also finger extension, along with voxels where damage affected only one of the two movements. The capacity to execute shoulder abduction and finger extension movements following stroke is affected significantly by damage to shared and distinct voxels in the corticospinal tract in left-hemispheric damage patients and by damage to shared and distinct voxels in a larger array of cortical and subcortical regions in right hemispheric damage patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Noninvasive perfusion-weighted imaging with short scanning time could be advantageous in order to determine presumed penumbral regions and subsequent treatment strategy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Our aim was to evaluate interobserver agreement and the clinical utility of intravoxel incoherent motion MR imaging in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 29 patients with AIS (17 men, 12 women; mean age, 75.2 SD, 12.0  years; median, 77 years). Each patient underwent intravoxel incoherent motion MR imaging using a 1.5T MR imaging scanner. Diffusion-sensitizing gradients were applied sequentially in the x, y, and z directions with 6 different b-values (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 1000 secondsmm(2)). From the intravoxel incoherent motion MR imaging data, diffusion coefficient, perfusion fraction, and pseudodiffusion coefficient maps were obtained using a 2-step fitting algorithm based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The presence of decreases in the intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and pseudodiffusion coefficient values compared with the contralateral normal-appearing brain was graded on a 2-point scale by 2 independent neuroradiologists. Interobserver agreement on the rating scale was evaluated using the kappa statistic. Clinical characteristics of patients with a nondecreased intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction andor pseudodiffusion coefficient rated by the 2 observers were also assessed.; RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was shown for the intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction (kappa = 0.854) and pseudodiffusion coefficient (kappa = 0.789) maps, which indicated almost perfect and substantial agreement, respectively. Patients with a nondecreased intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction tended to show recanalization of the occluded intracranial arteries more frequently than patients with a decreased intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction.; CONCLUSIONS: Intravoxel incoherent motion MR imaging could be performed in < 1 minute in addition to routine DWI. Intravoxel incoherent motion parameters noninvasively provide feasible, qualitative perfusion-related information for assessing patients with acute ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Object. The authors evaluated the clinical impact of combining functional neuronavigation with subcortical electrical stimulation to preserve motor function following the removal of brain tumors.
Methods. Forty patients underwent surgery for treatment of brain tumors located near pyramidal tracts that had been identified by fiber tracking. The distances between the electrically stimulated white matter and the pyramidal tracts were measured intraoperatively with tractography-integrated functional neuronavigation, and correlated with subcortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and clinical symptoms during and after resection of the tumors.; Motor function was preserved after appropriate tumor resection in all cases. In 18 of 20 patients, MEPs were elicited from the subcortex within 1 cm of the pyramidal tracts as measured using intraoperative neuronavigation. During resection, improvement of motor weakness was observed in two patients, whereas transient mild motor weakness occurred in two other patients. In 20 patients, the distances between the stimulated subcortex and the estimated pyramidal tracts were more than 1 cm, and MEPs were detected in only three of these patients following stimulation.; Conclusions. Intraoperative functional neuronavigation and subcortical electrical stimulation are complementary techniques that may facilitate the preservation of pyramidal tracts around 1 cm of resected tumors.

N2  -  Invasive growth along white matter (WM) tracts is one of the most prominent clinicopathological features of glioma and is also an important reason for surgical treatment failure in glioma patients. A full understanding of relevant clinical features and mechanisms is of great significance for finding new therapeutic targets and developing new treatment regimens and strategies. Herein, we review the imaging and histological characteristics of glioma patients with WM tracts invasion and summarize the possible molecular mechanism. On this basis, we further discuss the correlation between glioma molecular typing, radiotherapy and tumor treating fields (TTFields) and the invasion of glioma along WM tracts.

N2  -  Global tracking (GT) is a recently published fibre tractography (FT) method that takes simultaneously all fibres into account during their reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to compare this new method with fibre assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) and probabilistic tractography (PT) for the detection of the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with gliomas.
Tractography of the CST was performed in 17 patients with eight low grade and nine anaplastic astrocytomas located in the motor cortex or the corticospinal tract. Diffusions metrics as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained. The methods were additionally applied on a physical phantom to assess their accuracy.; PT was successful in all (100 %), GT in 16 (94 %) and FACT in 15 patients (88 %). The case where GT and FACT, both, missed the CST showed the highest AD and RD, whereas the one where FACT algorithm, alone, was not successfully showed the lowest AD and RD of the group. FA was reduced on the pathologic side (FA(path) 0.35 +- 0.16 (mean +- SD) versus FA(contralateral) 0.51 +- 0.15, p (corr) < 0.03). RD was increased on the pathologic side (RDpath 0.67 +- 0.29 x 10(-) (3) mm(2)s versus RDcontralateral 0.46 +- 0.08 x 10(-) (3) mm(2)s, p (corr) < 0.03). In the phantom measurement, only GT did not detect false positive fibres at fibre crossings.; PT performed well even in areas of increased diffusivities indicating a severe oedema or disintegration of tissue. FACT was also susceptible to a decrease of diffusivities and to a susceptibility artefact, where GT was robust.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Given the increased use of stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy and other ablative therapies for tremor, new biomarkers are needed to improve outcomes. Using resting-state fMRI and MR tractography, we hypothesized that a "connectome fingerprint" can predict tremor outcomes and potentially serve as a targeting biomarker for stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 27 patients who underwent unilateral stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy for essential tremor or tremor-predominant Parkinson disease. Percentage postoperative improvement in the contralateral limb Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) was the primary end point. Connectome-style resting-state fMRI and MR tractography were performed before stereotactic radiosurgery. Using the final lesion volume as a seed, "connectivity fingerprints" representing ideal connectivity maps were generated as whole-brain R-maps using a voxelwise nonparametric Spearman correlation. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed using the generated R-maps.; RESULTS: The mean improvement in the contralateral tremor score was 55.1% (SD, 38.9%) at a mean follow-up of 10.0 (SD, 5.0) months. Structural connectivity correlated with contralateral TRS improvement (r = 0.52; P = .006) and explained 27.0% of the variance in outcome. Functional connectivity correlated with contralateral TRS improvement (r = 0.50; P = .008) and explained 25.0% of the variance in outcome. Nodes most correlated with tremor improvement corresponded to areas of known network dysfunction in tremor, including the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway and the primary and extrastriate visual cortices.; CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgical targets with a distinct connectivity profile predict improvement in tremor after treatment. Such connectomic fingerprints show promise for developing patient-specific biomarkers to guide therapy with stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy.

N2  -  Spatial working memory problems are frequently reported following brain damage within both left and right hemispheres but with the severity often being grater in individuals with right hemisphere lesions. Clinically, deficits in spatial working memory have also been noted in patients with visuospatial disorders such as unilateral neglect. Here, we examined neural substrates of short-term memory for spatial locations based on the Corsi Block tapping task and the relationship with the visuospatial deficits of neglect and extinction in a group of chronic neuropsychological patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to distinguish shared and dissociate functional components. The neural substrates of spatial short-term memory deficits and the components identified by PCA were examined using whole brain voxel-based morphometry and tract-wise lesion deficits analyses. We found that bilateral lesions within occipital cortex (middle occipital gyrus) and right posterior parietal cortex, along with disconnection of the right parieto-temporal segment of arcuate fasciculus, were associated with low spatial memory span. A single component revealed by PCA accounted for over half of the variance and was linked to damage to right posterior brain regions (temporo-parietal junction, the inferior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus extending into middle occipital gyrus). We also found link to disconnections within several association pathways including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. These results indicate that different visuospatial deficits converge into a single component mapped within posterior parietal areas and fronto-parietal white matter pathways. Furthermore, the data presented here fit with the role of posterior parietal cortex/temporo-parietal junction in maintaining a map a salient locations in space, with Corsi Block performance being impaired when the spatial map is damaged.

N2  -  In solid tumors, elevated fluid pressure and inadequate blood perfusion resulting from unbalanced angiogenesis are the prominent reasons for the ineffective drug delivery inside tumors. To normalize the heterogeneous and tortuous tumor vessel structure, antiangiogenic treatment is an effective approach. Additionally, the combined therapy of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapy drugs has shown promising effects on enhanced drug delivery. However, the need to find the appropriate scheduling and dosages of the combination therapy is one of the main problems in anticancer therapy. Our study aims to generate a realistic response to the treatment schedule, making it possible for future works to use these patient-specific responses to decide on the optimal starting time and dosages of cytotoxic drug treatment. Our dataset is based on our previous in-silico model with a framework for the tumor microenvironment, consisting of a tumor layer, vasculature network, interstitial fluid pressure, and drug diffusion maps. In this regard, the chemotherapy response prediction problem is discussed in the study, putting forth a proof of concept for deep learning models to capture the tumor growth and drug response behaviors simultaneously. The proposed model utilizes multiple convolutional neural network submodels to predict future tumor microenvironment maps considering the effects of ongoing treatment. Since the model has the task of predicting future tumor microenvironment maps, we use two image quality evaluation metrics, which are structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, to evaluate model performance. We track tumor cell density values of ground truth and predicted tumor microenvironments. The model predicts tumor microenvironment maps seven days ahead with the average structural similarity score of 0.973 and the average peak signal ratio of 35.41 in the test set. It also predicts tumor cell density at the end day of 7 with the mean absolute percentage error of 2.292 +/- 1.820.

N2  -  Object. Outcome following brain tumor operations is often assessed by health professionals using various gross function scales. However. surprisingly little is known about how modern glioma surgery affects quality of life (QOL) as reported by the patients themselves. In the present study the authors aimed to assess changes in QOL after glioma surgery, to explore the relationship between QOL and traditional outcome parameters. and to examine possible predictors of change in QOL.
Methods. Eighty-eight patients with glioma were recruited from among those 16 years or older who had been admitted to the authors' department for brain tumor surgery in die period between January 2007 and December 2009. A 3D ultrasonography based navigation system was utilized in nearly all operations and functional MR imaging data on eloquent lesions were incorporated into the neuronavigation system. Preoperative scores for QOL (EuroQol 5D EQ-5D) and functional status (Karnofsky Performance Scale KPS were obtained. The EQ-5D and KPS scores were subsequently recorded 6 weeks postoperatively, as were responses to a structured interview about new deficits and possible complications.; Results. There was no change in the median EQ-5D indexes following surgery, 0.76 versus 0.75 (p = 0.419). The EQ-5D index value was significantly correlated with the KPS score (p < 0.001: rho = (1.769). The EQ-5D index values and KPS scores improved in 35.2% and 24.1% of cases, were equal in 20.5% and 47.2% of cases, and deteriorated in 44.3% and 28.7%. respectively. Thus, both improvement and deterioration were underestimated by the KPS score as compared with the patient-reported QOL assessment. New motor deficits (p = 0.003). new language deficits (p = 0.0)35), new unsteadiness andor ataxia (p = 0.001). occipital lesions (p = 0.019). and no use of ultrasonography for resection control (p = 0.021) were independent predictors of worsening QOL in a multivariate model.; Conclusions. The surgical procedures per se may not significantly alter QOL in the average patient with glioma: however. new deficits have a major Undesirable effect on QOL. It seems that the active use of intraoperative ultrasonography may be associated with a preservation of QOL. The EQ-5D seems like a good outcome measure with a strong correlation to traditional variables while offering a more detailed description of outcome. (DOI: 10.31712011.1.JNS101657)

N2  -  PurposeThe aim of this study was to investigate alterations in white matter lesions (WMLs) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) with small vessel disease (SVD) over 1-2 years using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and free-water (FW) mapping. MethodsFifty-one SVD patients underwent MRI brain scans and neuropsychological testing both at baseline and follow-up. The main approach for treating these patients is the management of risk factors. Quantitative susceptibility (QS), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), FW, FW-corrected FA (FA(T)), and FW-corrected MD (MDT) maps within WMLs and NAWM were generated. Furthermore, the JHU-ICBM-DTI label atlas was used as an anatomic guide, and the measurements of the segmented NAWMs were calculated. The average regional values were extracted, and a paired t-test was used to analyze the longitudinal change. Partial correlations were used to assess the relationship between the MRI indices changes (e.g., Delta QS(followup - baseline)/QS(baseline)) and the cognitive function changes (e.g., Delta MoCA(followup - baseline)/MoCA(baseline)). ResultsAfter SVD risk factor control, no gradual cognitive decline occurred during 1-2 years. However, we still found that the QS values (index of demyelination) increased in the NAWM at follow-up, especially in the NAWM part of the left superior frontal blade (SF), left occipital blade, right uncinate fasciculus, and right corticospinal tract (CST). FW (index of neuroinflammation/edema) analysis revealed that the follow-up group differed from the baseline group in the NAWM part of the right CST and inferior frontal blade (IF). Decreased FA(T) (index of axonal loss) was observed in the NAWM part of the right SF and IF at follow-up. In addition, the FA(T) changes in the NAWM part of the right IF were associated with overall cognitive performance changes. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the WMLs. ConclusionThe NAWM was still in the progressive injury process over time, while WMLs remained relatively stable, which supports the notion that SVD is a chronic progressive disease. The process of axonal loss in the NAWM part of the prefrontal lobe might be a biomarker of cognitive changes in the evolution of SVD.

N2  -  The resection of tumors within the primary motor cortex is a constant challenge. Although tractography may help in preoperative planning, it has limited application. While it can give valuable information on subcortical fibers, it is less accurate in the cortical layer of the brain. A 38-year-old patient presented with paresis of the right hand and focal epileptic seizures due to a tumor in the left precentral gyrus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was not applicable due to seizures, so microsurgical resection was performed with preoperative tractography and intraoperative direct electrical stimulation. A histopathological assessment revealed a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed complete resection. The paresis dissolved completely during follow-up. Surgery within the precentral gyrus is of high risk and requires multimodal functional planning. If interpreted with vigilance and consciousness of the underlying physical premises, tractography can provide helpful information within its limitations, which is especially subcortically. However, it may also help in the identification of functional cortex columns of the brain in the presence of a tumor.

N2  -  Purpose Phospholipids are key constituents of cell membranes and serve vital functions in the regulation of cellular processes; thus, a method for in vivo detection and characterization could be valuable for detecting changes in cell membranes that are consequences of either normal or pathological processes. Here, we describe a new method to map the distribution of partially restricted phospholipids in tissues.
Methods The phospholipids were measured by signal changes caused by relayed nuclear Overhauser enhancement-mediated CEST between the phospholipid Cho headgroup methyl protons and water at around -1.6 ppm from the water resonance. The biophysical basis of this effect was examined by controlled manipulation of head group, chain length, temperature, degree of saturation, and presence of cholesterol. Additional experiments were performed on animal tumor models to evaluate potential applications of this novel signal while correcting for confounding contributions.; Results Negative relayed nuclear Overhauser dips in Z-spectra were measured from reconstituted Cho phospholipids with cholesterol but not for other Cho-containing metabolites or proteins. Significant contrast was found between tumor and contralateral normal tissue signals in animals when comparing both the measured saturation transfer signal and a more specific imaging metric.; Conclusion We demonstrated specific relayed nuclear Overhauser effects in partially restricted phospholipid phantoms and similar effects in solid brain tumors after correcting for confounding signal contributions, suggesting possible translational applications of this novel molecular imaging method, which we name restricted phospholipid transfer.

N2  -  Background: Emerging evidence suggests that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) may induce cognitive decline and dementia, however, the pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood.
Objective: We sought to determine the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and neuronal integrity in cognitively impaired patients.; Methods: One hundred nine patients with memory impairment were divided into quartiles according to serum concentrations of 25OHD concentration, from lowest (L-25OHD) to highest (H-25OHD). The diffusion tensor images from the L-25OHD group and the H-25OHD group were assessed. A mask of regional white matter hyperintensities was obtained in the T1-weighted image space. Data were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics with a nonlinear registration algorithm.; Results: Patients in the L-25OHD group had lower fractional anisotropy values compared with patients in the H-25OHD group in the frontal parts of the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, cingulum bundle, corpus callosum (genu), anterior limb of the internal capsule, and anterior corona radiata (familywise error corrected, p < 0.05).; Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with disruption of neuronal integrity, primarily in frontal regions. Vitamin D deficiency may lead to the loss of neuroprotective properties in cerebral ischemia and vascular lesions, contributing to memory impairment.

N2  -  The frontal aslant tract (FAT) connects the supplementary motor area (SMA) with the pars opercularis. Its role in language and its implications in glioma surgery remain under discussion. We present an anatomosurgical study of three cases with surgical resolution. Three patients with gliomas in the left frontal lobe were operated on using an awake patient protocol with cortical and subcortical mapping techniques, conducting motor and language evaluations. Tractography was performed using DSI Studio software. All three patients showed intraoperative language inhibition through subcortical stimulation of the FAT. Resection involving the FAT correlated with language deficits in all cases and movement initiation deficits in two cases. All patients recovered from their deficits at six months postoperatively. In conclusion, the tract has been successfully reconstructed, showing both anatomical and functional complexity, supporting the idea of its mapping and preservation in glioma surgery. Future interdisciplinary studies are necessary to determine the transient or permanent nature of the deficits.

N2  -  There is a growing understanding of the prognostic importance of non-contrast-enhancing tumor in glioblastoma, and recent attempts at more aggressive management of this component using neurosurgical resection and radiosurgery have been shown to prolong survival. Optimizing these therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the features that can distinguish non-contrast-enhancing tumor from other processes, in particular vasogenic edema; however, the limited and heterogeneous manner in which it has been defined in the literature limits clinical translation. This review covers pertinent literature on our growing understanding of non-contrast-enhancing tumor and focuses on key conventional MR imaging features for improving its delineation. Such features include subtle differences in the degree of FLAIR hyperintensity, gray matter involvement, and focal mass effect. Improved delineation of tumor from edema will facilitate more aggressive management of this component and potentially realize associated survival benefits.

N2  -  Objective: We investigated the association between regional white and gray matter volume loss and performance on executive functions (EFs) in patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI).
Methods: We studied 164 pTBI patients and 43 healthy controls from the Vietnam Head Injury Study. We acquired CT scans for pTBI patients and divided them according to lesion localization (left and right prefrontal cortex PFC). We administered EF tests (Verbal Fluency, Trail Making, Twenty Questions) and used voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) and group-based correlational and multiple regression analyses to examine the relative influence of gray and white matter lesions on EF recovery.; Results: The VLSM analysis revealed that white and gray white matter lesions were associated with impaired EFs. In the left PFC lesion group, damage to the PFC gray matter, anterior corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were most correlated with functional recovery. Verbal Fluency, which involves a broad fronto-temporo-parietal network, was best predicted by SLF lesion volume. Trail Making and Twenty Questions, which is associated with more focal left frontal damage, was better predicted by PFC lesions.; Conclusions: Our results indicated that whitematter volume loss can be a superior predictor of recovery and a crucial factor driving clinical outcome in functions involving a broad network such as Verbal Fluency. White matter damage may place additional burden on recovery by deteriorating signal transmission between cortical areas within a functional network.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Tractography is a useful technique that is standardly applied to visualize subcortical pathways. However, brain shift hampers tractography use during the course of surgery. While intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) has been shown to be beneficial for use in oncology, intraoperative tractography can rarely be performed due to scanner, protocol, or head clamp limitations. Elastic fusion (EF), however, enables adjustment for brain shift of preoperative imaging and even tractography based on intraoperative images. The authors tested the hypothesis that adjustment of tractography by ioMRI-based EF (IBEF) correlates with the results of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) and clinical outcome and is therefore a reliable method.
METHODS In 304 consecutive patients treated between June 2018 and March 2020, 8 patients, who made up the basic study cohort, showed an intraoperative loss of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during motor-eloquent glioma resection for a subcortical lesion within the corticospinal tract (CST) as shown by ioMRI. The authors preoperatively visualized the CST using tractography. Also, IBEFs of pre- and intraoperative images were obtained and the location of the CST was compared in relation to a subcortical lesion. In 11 patients (8 patients with intraoperative loss of MEPs, one of whom also showed loss of MEPs on IBEF evaluation, plus 3 additional patients with loss of MEPs on IBEF evaluation), the authors examined the location of the CST by direct subcortical stimulation (DSCS). The authors defined the IONM results and the functional outcome data as ground truth for analysis.; RESULTS The maximum mean +- SD correction was 8.8 +- 2.9 (range 3.8-12.0) mm for the whole brain and 5.3 +- 2.4 (range 1.2-8.7) mm for the CST. The CST was located within the lesion before IBEF in 3 cases and after IBEF in all cases (p = 0.0256). All patients with intraoperative loss of MEPs suffered from surgery-related permanent motor deficits. By approximation, the location of the CST after IBEF could be verified by DSCS in 4 cases.; CONCLUSIONS The present study shows that tractography after IBEF accurately correlates with IONM and patient outcomes and thus demonstrates reliability in this initial study.

N2  -  Objective
Dysphagia is one of the most common complications of acute ischemic stroke, and prediction of dysphagia is crucial for post-stroke treatment. We aimed to identify predictors of dysphagia and swallowing function recovery following ischemic stroke and to investigate dysphagia-associated lesion location. Methods We prospectively enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke confirmed on diffusion-weighted imaging. All patients received swallowing evaluation within 48 h after admission. Follow-up oral intake ability was measured on 7 and 30 days after stroke onset. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to determine locations associated with dysphagia.; Results; Of 126 patients included in the final analysis, 23 patients (18.3%) were classified as initial dysphagia. The presence of facial palsy (P = 0.008) and larger white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume (P = 0.003) was associated with initial dysphagia. Initial risk of aspiration assessed by Any2 score (P = 0.001) at baseline was identified as independent predictor for dysphagia at day 7. Patients with higher Any2 score (P < 0.001), aphasia (P = 0.013), and larger WMH volume (P = 0.010) were less likely to have a full swallowing function recovery at 1 month. Acute infarcts in right corona radiata and right superior longitudinal fasciculus were correlated with impaired recovery of swallowing ability at 1 month.; Conclusions; Initial risk of aspiration was identified as risk factor for short-term and long-term dysphagia. Aphasia and larger WMH volume were revealed to be significant predictors for swallowing function recovery at 1 month. Right corona radiata was identified as an essential brain area for dysphagia.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In patients with essential tremor (ET) treated with standard deep brain stimulation (sDBS) whose ET had progressed and who no longer received optimal benefit from sDBS, directional deep brain stimulation (dDBS) may provide better tremor control. Current steering may provide better coverage of subcortical structures related to tremor control in patients with ET and significant progression without optimal response to sDBS.METHODS This study included 6 patients with ET initially treated with sDBS whose tremor later progressed and who then underwent reimplantation with dDBS to optimize their tremor control. To investigate the differences in the local effects of sDBS and dDBS, the authors generated the volume of tissue activation (VTA) to calculate the sweet spots associated with the best possible tremor control with no side effects. Then, to investigate the anatomical structures asso-ciated with maximal tremor control, the white matter pathways of the posterior subthalamic areas (PSAs) were generated and their involvement with the sDBS and dDBS sweet spots was calculated.RESULTS Tremor improvement was significantly better with dDBS (68.4%) than with sDBS (48.7%) (p = 0.017). The sDBS sweet spot was located within the ventral intermediate nucleus, whereas the sweet spot of the dDBS was mainly located within the PSA. The sweet spots of both sDBS and dDBS involved a similar portion of the cerebellothalamic pathway. However, the dDBS had greater involvement of the pallidofugal pathways than the sDBS.CONCLUSIONS In patients with ET treated with sDBS who later had ET progression, dDBS provided better tremor control, which was related to directionality and a more ventral position. The involvement of both the cerebellothalamic and pallidofugal pathways obtained with dDBS is associated with additional improvement over the sDBS.

N2  -  Rim restriction surrounding the resection cavity of glioma is often seen on immediate post-op diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The etiology and clinical impact of rim restriction are unknown. We evaluated the incidence, risk factors and clinical consequences of this finding. We evaluated patients that underwent surgery for low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) without stroke on post-operative imaging. Analyses encompassed pre- and postoperative clinical, radiological, intraoperative monitoring, survival, functional and neurocognitive outcomes. Between 2013 and 2017, 63 LGG and 209 GBM patients (272 in total) underwent surgical resection and were included in our cohort. Post-op rim restriction was demonstrated in 68 patients, 32% (n = 20) of LGG and 23% (n = 48) of GBM patients. Risk factors for restriction included temporal tumors in GBM (p = 0.025) and insular tumors in LGG (p = 0.09), including longer surgery duration in LGG (p = 0.008). After a 1-year follow-up, LGG patients operated on their dominant with post-op restriction had a higher rate of speech deficits (46 vs 9%, p = 0.004). Rim restriction on postoperative imaging is associated with longer duration of glioma surgery and potentially linked to brain retraction. It apparently has no direct clinical consequences, but is linked to higher rates of speech deficits in LGG dominant-side surgeries.

N2  -  AIM: To present an overview of our awake craniotomy practices performed with complementary use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based neuronavigation (DTI-bN) and cortical-subcortical electrical stimulation for glioma resection located in eloquent areas, and the clinical outcomes of these practices regarding neurological morbidity and residual tumour volume.
MATERIAL and METHODS: This study was conducted between October 2016 and December 2017 involving 18 cases. The DTI-bN method, in addition to cortical-subcortical stimulation, was done with awake craniotomy. Changes in the neurological status of the patients and results of the method regarding residual tumour volume were recorded. This retrospective study use data obtained from patients' records and radiological examinations.; RESULTS: Of the 18 patients, a gross total resection was performed on nine patients (50%), a near total resection was performed on seven patients (38.8%) and a subtotal resection was performed on two patients (11.1%). Intraoperative neurological deterioration was observed in 14 of 18 patients during their surgical procedures, and neurological examinations in the sixth post-operative month revealed permanent deficits in two patients.; CONCLUSION: This study is one of the rare series to have presented the results of the use DTI-bN method as well as cortical-subcortical stimulation during awake craniotomy, according to literature review. In 88% of cases, tumour resection rates are over 90%.

N2  -  Trans-sulcal minimally invasive parafascicular surgery is an emerging technique to approach deep lesions with minimal brain retraction. Localization of the tubular retractor during surgery is critical, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigation present limitations. We describe the intraoperative use of O-Arm (R) coupled with pre-operative tractography to precisely localize the tubular retractor. With air acting as contrast, the tubular retractor was localized in three dimensions, without any additional disruption to white matter tracts or nearby vascular structures. We conclude that visualization of tubular retractor using an intraoperative computerized tomography scan is a safe and feasible adjunct in resection of deep lesions via a minimally invasive approach.

N2  -  Surgical techniques of treating patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have changed considerably in the last 25 years. Greatest success has been achieved in patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) positive temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), especially in patients with hippocampal sclerosis, and more recently in patients with extratemporal lesional epilepsy. This improvement is mostly due to large progress in imaging technology, but also in neurophysiological methods and microsurgical techniques. Very important is careful patient selection and preoperative evaluation via identification of the semiology of seizures, localization of epileptogemc lesion, and ictal onset zone. In preoperative evaluation of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, modern diagnostic techniques can be divided into noninvasive and invasive. Noninvasive methods include: (a) video-electroencephalography (EEG) recording (interictal and ictal); (b) preoperative neuropsychological testing; (c) dedicated neuroradiological examination, i.e. 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with specialized M RI techniques including morphometric MR analysis, MR spectroscopy, functional MRI with MR tractography, and MR volumetry; (d) nuclear-medicine methods, i.e. single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET); and (e) magnetoencephalography (MEG). Invasive methods include: (a) Wada test (intracarotid amobarbital or etomidate testing); (b) semi-invasive video-EEG monitoring, using sphenoidal or foramen ovale electrodes; and (c) invasive video-EEG monitoring, using subdural strip and grid as well as depth electrodes. Invasive EEG monitoring, where selection of the type of intracramal electrodes and their placement depends on the localization of epileptogemc region, is used if MRI is nonlesional, if there is discrepancy between ictal or interictal EEG recordings and brain MRI, between the seizure semiology and the imaging findings, and between the seizure semiology and EEG recording. It is also used in case of dual pathology and polytope changes, when it is not known which pathomorphological lesion is epileptogenic, and in case of positive brain MRI when pathomorphological lesion is localized near motor and eloquent cortex. The possible complications include ultra-cranial hemorrhage, cortical lesions and infection.

N2  -  The present study explores the functional neuroanatomy of the phonological production system in an Italian aphasic patient (SP) who developed conduction aphasia of the reproduction type following brain surgery. SP presented with two peculiar features: (1) his lesion was localized in the superior temporal gyrus, just posterior to the primary auditory cortex and anterior/inferior to and neighboring the Sylvian parietal temporal (Spt) area, and (2) he presented with severely impaired repetition and spelling from dictation of words and pseudowords but spared reading-aloud of words and pseudowords.
Structural, functional, fiber tracking and intraoperative findings were combined to analyze SP's pattern of performance within a widely used sensorimotor control scheme of speech production.; We found a dissociation between an interrupted sector of the arcuate fasciculus terminating in STG, known to be involved in phonological processing, and a part of the arcuate fasciculus terminating in MTG, which is held to be involved in lexical-semantic processing. We argue that this phonological deficit should be interpreted as a disorder of the feedback system, in particular of the auditory and somatosensory target maps, which are assumed to be located along the Spt area. In patient SP, the spared part of the left arcuate fasciculus originating in MTG may support an unimpaired reading performance, while the damaged part of the left arcuate fasciculus originating in STG may be responsible for his impaired repetition and spelling from dictation.

N2  -  White matter thalamo-cortical fibers allow the communication of distant brain regions by carrying neuronal signals. Mapping non-invasively the information flow within white matter fibers is regarded so far as impossible. We investigated here whether information flow propagating along thalamo-cortical fibers can be detected using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Somatosensory evoked fields (SEFs) were recorded from healthy subjects and a patient with a unilateral, prenatally acquired, white matter lesion, which had induced the development of an abnormal trajectory of thalamo-cortical fibers. Equivalent current dipole (ECD) was used to model sources of SEFs. ECD at similar to 15 ms after stimulus onset was located within or close to the contralateral thalamus at the proximity of a hemodynamic response detected during a similar fMRI experiment. At the M20 peak latency, ECD was localized within the hand area of the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (Brodmann area 3b (BA3b)). In healthy subjects. ECD changed dynamically position from thalamus to BA3b following a curved path, which was partially overlapping the thalamo-cortical fibers reconstructed by tractography. In the patient. ECD followed a similar path only in the intact hemisphere. In the affected hemisphere, the dipole trajectory circumnavigated the extended lesion on its way to the preserved primary somatosensory cortex similar to the trajectory findings. Evidence from different methodological approaches converges on the conclusion that MEG can track the afferent information flow along thalamo-cortical fibers and in contrast to the traditional view can localize under presuppositions deep thalamic sources.

N2  -  Background: Major depression (MD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are psychiatric diseases with a huge impact on individual well-being. Despite optimal treatment regiments a subgroup of patients remains treatment resistant and stereotactic surgery (stereotactic lesion surgery, SLS or Deep Brain Stimulation, DBS) might be an option. Recent research has described four networks related to MD and OCD (affect, reward, cognitive control, default network) but only on a cortical and the adjacent sub-cortical level. Despite the enormous impact of comparative neuroanatomy, animal science and stereotactic approaches a holistic theory of subcortical and cortical network interactions is elusive. Because of the dominant hierarchical rank of the neocortex, corticofugal approaches have been used to identify connections in subcortical anatomy without anatomical priors and in part confusing results. We here propose a different corticopetal approach by identifying subcortical networks and search for neocortical convergences thereby following the principle of phylogenetic and ontogenetic network development.
Material and methods: This work used a diffusion tensor imaging data from a normative cohort (Human Connectome Project, HCP; n = 200) to describe eight subcortical fiber projection pathways (PPs) from subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra (SNR), red nucleus (RN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), ventrolateral thalamus (VLT) and mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) in a normative space (MND. Subcortical and cortical convergences were described including an assignment of the specific pathways to MDOCD-related networks. Volumes of activated tissue for different stereotactic stimulation sites and procedures were simulated to understand the role of the distinct networks, with respect to symptoms and treatment of OCD and MD.; Results: The detailed course of eight subcortical PPs (stnPP, snrPP, rnPP, v1ATR, v1ATRc, mdATR, mdATRc, vtaPPs1MFB) were described together with their subcortical and cortical convergences. The anterior limb of the internal capsule can be subdivided with respect to network occurrences in ventral-dorsal and medio-lateral gradients. Simulation of stereotactic procedures for OCD and MD showed dominant involvement of mdATRmdATRc (affect network) and vtaPPs1MFB (reward network).; Discussion: Corticofugal search strategies for the evaluation of stereotactic approaches without anatomical priors often lead to confusing results which do not allow for a clear assignment of a procedure to an involved network. According to our simulation of stereotactic procedures in the treatment of OCD and MD, most of the target regions directly involve the reward (and affect) networks, while side-effects can in part be explained with a comodulation of the control network.; Conclusion: The here proposed corticopetal approach of a hierarchical description of 8 subcortical PPs with subcortical and cortical convergences represents a new systematics of networks found in all different evolutionary and distinct parts of the human brain.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Thalamomesencephalic lesions remain a challenge to neurosurgeons for their eloquent anatomy and postoperative neurological deficits. With limited cases in the literature, these lesions are still managed in a case-by-case fashion. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of an otherwise healthy man who had a 46-day history of impaired vision and right-sided weakness and numbness caused by ventrally located thalamomesencephalic cavernous malformations (CMs). A modified transanterior perforated substance approach using the medial territory was performed for gross total resection of the CMs. No new-onset neurological deficits were observed postoperatively. Apart from visual improvements, the patient's muscle strength constantly improved and recovered full strength on 14-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The authors believe that the transanterior perforated substance approach through the medial territory can be considered as an option for ventrally located thalamomesencephalic CMs.

N2  -  Introduction: The anatomical structures of the parietal lobe at the cortical and subcortical levels are related mainly to sensory, visuospatial, visual and language function. The aim of this study was to present an intraoperative perspective of these critical structures in terms of the surgical treatment of intra-axial lesions. The study also discusses the results of the technique and the results of direct brain stimulation under awake conditions.Materials and Methods: Five adult brains were prepared according to the Klingler technique. Cortical assessments and all measurements were performed with the naked eye, while white matter dissection was performed with microscopic magnification.Results: Intra-axial lesions within the parietal lobe can be approached through a lateral or superior trajectory. This decision is based on the location of the lesions in relation to the arcuate fascicle/superior longitudinal fascicle (AF/SLF) complex and ventricular system. Regardless of the approach, the functional borders of the resection are defined by the postcentral gyrus anteriorly and Wernicke's speech area inferiorly. On the subcortical level, active identification of the AF/SLF complex and of the optic radiation within the sagittal stratum should be performed. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is a reliable landmark for the AF/SLF complex in ~60% of cases.Conclusion: Knowledge of the cortical and subcortical anatomical and functional borders of the resection is crucial in preoperative planning, prediction of the risk of postoperative deficits, and intraoperative decision making.

N2  -  Recent neuroimaging developments allow a better in vivo characterization of the structural and functional connectivity of the human cerebellum. Ultrahigh fields, which considerably increase spatial resolution, enable to visualize deep cerebellar nuclei and cerebello-cortical sublayers. Tractography reconstructs afferent and efferent pathway of the cerebellum. Resting-state functional connectivity individualizes the prewired, parallel close-looped sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective networks passing through the cerebellum. These results are un agreement with activation maps obtained during stimulation functional neuroimaging or inferred from neurological deficits due to cerebellar lesions. Therefore, neuroimaging supports the hypothesis that cerebellum constitutes a general modulator involved in optimizing mental performance and computing internal models. However, the great challenges will remain to unravel: (1) the functional role of red and bulbar olivary nuclei, (2) the information processing in the cerebellar microcircuitry, and (3) the abstract computation performed by the cerebellum and shared by sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective domains.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new technique in brainstem surgery, neuronavigation (NN)-guided corticospinal tract (CST) mapping, in a retrospective study of patients undergoing brainstem tumor surgery.
METHODS: We studied 40 patients with a brainstem tumor who were enrolled in this study. Patients whose worst preoperative muscle strength of the 4 limbs was greater than 3 levels from normal on the Lovett scale were divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of 21 patients who underwent NN-guided CST mapping and routine intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring (IONM) and a control group of 19 patients who underwent routine NN and IONM . Preoperative muscle strength and postoperative (day 90 postsurgery) muscle strength were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.; RESULTS: In the NN-guided CST mapping group, 3 patients (14.3%) had a decrease in muscle strength by 1 level postoperatively, and no patient experienced a decrease of >1 level. In the control group, 4 patients (21.1%) had a 1-level decrease in muscle strength, and 5 (26.3%) had a decrease of >1 level. Patients in the NN-guided CST mapping group had significantly better surgical outcomes compared with those in the control group (P = 0.018, Fisher exact test).; CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem tumor resection using NN-guided CST mapping achieved better preservation of motor function compared with routine NN and IONM. NN-guided CST mapping not only decreased the difficulty of the surgery, but also significantly improved the efficiency of surgery.

N2  -  The insula is a lobe located deep in each hemisphere of the brain and is surrounded by eloquent cortical, white matter, and basal ganglia structures. The aim of this study was to provide an anatomical description of the insula and white matter tracts related to surgical treatment of gliomas through a transcortical approach. The study also discusses surgical implications in terms of intraoperative brain mapping. Five adult brains were prepared according to the Klingler technique. Cortical anatomy was evaluated with the naked eye, whereas white matter dissection was performed with the use of a microscope. The widest exposure of the insular surface was noted through the temporal operculum, mainly in zones III and IV according to the Berger-Sanai classification. By going through the pars triangularis in all cases, the anterior insular point and most of zone I were exposed. The narrowest and deepest operating field was observed by going through the parietal operculum. This method provided a suitable approach to zone II, where the corticospinal tract is not covered by the basal ganglia and is exposed just under the superior limiting sulcus. At the subcortical level, the identification of the inferior frontoocipital fasciculus at the level of the limen insulae is critical in terms of preserving the lenticulostriate arteries. Detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the insula and subcortical white matter that is exposed through each operculum is essential in preoperative planning as well as in the intraoperative decision-making process in terms of intraoperative brain mapping.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Using three-dimensional (3D) printing to create individualized patient models of the skull base, the optic chiasm and facial nerve can be previsualized to help identify and protect these structures during tumor removal surgery.
METHODS: Preoperative imaging data for 2 cases of sellar tumor and 1 case of acoustic neuroma were obtained. Based on these data, the cranial nerves were visualized using 3D T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence and diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking. Mimics software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the skull base regions surrounding the tumors, and 3D solid models were printed for use in simulation of the basic surgical steps.; RESULTS: The 3D printed personalized skull base tumor solid models contained information regarding the skull, brain tissue, blood vessels, cranial nerves, tumors, and other associated structures. The sphenoid sinus anatomy, saddle area, and cerebellopontine angle region could be visually displayed, and the spatial relationship between the tumor and the cranial nerves and important blood vessels was clearly defined. The models allowed for simulation of the operation, prediction of operative details, and verification of accuracy of cranial nerve reconstruction during the operation. Questionnaire assessment showed that neurosurgeons highly valued the accuracy and usefulness of these skull base tumor models.; CONCLUSIONS: 3D printed models of skull base tumors and nearby cranial nerves, by allowing for the surgical procedure to be simulated beforehand, facilitate preoperative planning and help prevent cranial nerve injury.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The out-of-body experience (OBE), during which a person feels as if he or she is spatially removed from the physical body, is a mystical phenomenon because of its association with near-death experiences. Literature implicates the cortex at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) as the possible anatomic substrate for OBE.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient who had an out-of-body experience during an awake craniotomy for resection of low-grade glioma. During surgery, stimulation of subcortical white matter in the left TPJ repetitively induced OBEs, in which the patient felt as if she was floating above the operating table looking down on herself.; CONCLUSIONS: We repetitively induced OBE by subcortical stimulation near the left TPJ during awake craniotomy. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography implicated the posterior thalamic radiation as a possible substrate for autoscopic phenomena.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no reproducibility study of fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements at 3T using regions of interest (ROIs). Our purpose was to establish the extent and statistical significance of the interrater variability, the variability observed with 2 different b-values, and in 2 separate scanning sessions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging twice. MR imaging was performed on a 3T unit, and FA maps were analyzed independently by 2 observers using ROIs positioned in the corpus callosum, internal capsules, corticospinal tracts, and right thalamus. Changes in FA values (X 10(3))) measured with 2 b-values (700 and 1000 smm(2)), age-related differences, interobserver agreement, and measurement reproducibility were assessed.; RESULTS: In the right internal capsule genu (FA = 702728; b = 1000700 smm(2)) and the left anterior limb of the internal capsule (AIC; FA = 617745; b = 1000700 smm(2)), the FA values were significantly different between the 2 b-values (P = .02 and .05, respectively). Significant age-related differences in FA were observed in the genu of the corpus callosum and in the left AIC. Interrater measurements showed fair-to-mode rate agreement for most anatomic structures. The lowest significant change for a single subject regarding any FA values between the 2 sessions was in the corpus callosum (4%), whereas the highest one was in the corticospinal tracts (27%). The Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that the 1000-smm(2) b-value gave satisfactorily reproducible measurements equally good or better than the 700-smm(2) b-value.; CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of FA estimates using ROIs was satisfactory. Measurements with a b-value at 1000 smm(2) showed superior reproducibility in most anatomic locations.

N2  -  Integrating transformers and convolutional neural networks represents a crucial and cutting-edge approach for tackling medical image segmentation problems. Nonetheless, the existing hybrid methods fail to fully leverage the strengths of both operators. During the Patch Embedding, the patch projection method ignores the two-dimensional structure and local spatial information within each patch, while the fixed patch size cannot capture features with rich representation effectively. Moreover, the calculation of self-attention results in attention diffusion, hindering the provision of precise details to the decoder while maintaining feature consistency. Lastly, none of the existing methods establish an efficient multi-scale modeling concept. To address these issues, we design the Collaborative Networks of Transformers and Convolutional neural networks (TC-CoNet), which is generally used for accurate 3D medical image segmentation. First, we elaborately design precise patch embedding to generate 3D features with accurate spatial position information, laying a solid foundation for subsequent learning. The encoder-decoder backbone network is then constructed by TC-CoNet in an interlaced combination to properly incorporate long-range dependencies and hierarchical object concepts at various scales. Furthermore, we employ the constricted attention bridge to constrict attention to local features, allowing us to accurately guide the recovery of detailed information while maintaining feature consistency. Finally, atrous spatial pyramid pooling is applied to high-level feature map to establish the concept of multi-scale objects. On five challenging datasets, including Synapse, ACDC, brain tumor segmentation, cardiac left atrium segmentation, and lung tumor segmentation, the extensive experiments demonstrate that TC-CoNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of superiority, migration, and strong generalization. These illustrate in full the efficacy of the proposed transformers and convolutional neural networks combination for medical image segmentation.

N2  -  Prism adaptation (PA) is a promising treatment in the rehabilitation of post-stroke cognitive disorders such as unilateral spatial neglect or constructional deficits. Right brain damage can bring about another representational spatial disorder, termed "hyperschematia", and defined by a left-sided disproportionate expansion of drawings by copy and from memory, and by an overestimation of left lateral extent when a leftward movement is required. This case study aimed at evaluating the effect of PA induced by prismatic lenses creating a shift to the left on hyperschematia signs. A 63-year-old woman with left hyperschematia, consecutive to a right fronto-temporoparietal hematoma, was exposed to a leftward optical deviation produced by prismatic lenses. An anatomical MRI studied topography of the brain lesion; the patients lesion was then mapped onto tractography reconstructions of white matter pathways. Results showed that PA significantly reduced the left-sided expansion of drawing by copy and from memory, and the overestimation of left lateral extent, immediately after prism removal and 4 days later, indicating a persistent long lasting cognitive effect. MRI showed a right hemisphere disconnection of the posterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, and of the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. Overall, these findings suggest that: i) PA is effective also in hyperschematia by reorientating spatial attention towards the right side of space, with a relative rightward PA-induced unbalance, and re-setting the spatial representation to the left side of space, contralateral to the side of the lesion; ii) the left misrepresentation of lateral extent may be related to a disconnection between visual coordinates and attentional networks to the frontal lobe.

N2  -  Tools pose a challenge to the need to select actions appropriate for task goals and environmental constraints. For many tools (e.g., calculator), actions for "using" and "grasping-to-move" conflict with each other and may compete during selection. To date, little is known about the mechanisms that enable selection between possible tool actions or their neural substrates. The study of patients with chronic left hemisphere stroke, many of whom are deficient in tool-use action (apraxic), provides an opportunity to elucidate these issues. Here, 31 such patients pantomimed or recognized tool use actions for "conflict" and "non-conflict" tools. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), lesion subtraction, and tractographic overlap analyses were used to determine brain regions necessary for selecting among tool-directed actions. Lesions to posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) tended to impair production of use actions similarly for both conflict and non-conflict tools. By contrast, lesions to the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/anterior insula, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) specifically impaired production of use actions for conflict tools. Patients' errors on conflict tools suggested inappropriate selection of grasping actions and difficulty selecting single actions. Use/grasp conflict had no effect on action recognition. We suggest that the SMG/SLF/IFG pathway implements biased competition between possible tool actions, while aIPS and pMTG compute the structure-based and skilled use actions, respectively, that constitute input to this competitive process. This is the first study to demonstrate a reliable link between a characteristic of single tools (i.e., their association with different use and grasp actions) and action selection difficulties. Additionally, the data allow us to posit an SMG-involved subtype of apraxia characterized by an inability to resolve action competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reasoning by analogy is central to generalisation and abstract thinking. Urbanski et al. show that the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex is a critical node in the analogy network. The use of analogy tasks in clinical practice would improve the assessment of abstraction and reasoning in patients with frontal lesions.Analogical reasoning is at the core of the generalization and abstraction processes that enable concept formation and creativity. The impact of neurological diseases on analogical reasoning is poorly known, despite its importance in everyday life and in society. Neuroimaging studies of healthy subjects and the few studies that have been performed on patients have highlighted the importance of the prefrontal cortex in analogical reasoning. However, the critical cerebral bases for analogical reasoning deficits remain elusive. In the current study, we examined analogical reasoning abilities in 27 patients with focal damage in the frontal lobes and performed voxel-based lesion-behaviour mapping and tractography analyses to investigate the structures critical for analogical reasoning. The findings revealed that damage to the left rostrolateral prefrontal region (or some of its long-range connections) specifically impaired the ability to reason by analogies. A short version of the analogy task predicted the existence of a left rostrolateral prefrontal lesion with good accuracy. Experimental manipulations of the analogy tasks suggested that this region plays a role in relational matching or integration. The current lesion approach demonstrated that the left rostrolateral prefrontal region is a critical node in the analogy network. Our results also suggested that analogy tasks should be translated to clinical practice to refine the neuropsychological assessment of patients with frontal lobe lesions.

N2  -  Background: Aggressive resection without compromising the patient's neurological status remains a significant challenge in treating intracranial gliomas. Our current study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extra-operative stimulation and mapping via implanted subdural electrodes with or without depth (EOCSM), offering an alternative approach when awake mapping is contraindicated. Methods: Fifty-one patients undergoing EOCSM for glioma resection in our institution formed the sample study of our current retrospective study. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of our approach by measuring the extent of resection and recording the periprocedural complications, respectively. Results: The mean age of our participants was 58 years (+/- 9.4 years). The lesion was usually located on the left side (80.4%) and affected the frontal lobe (51.0%). EOCSM was successful in 94.1% of patients. The stimulation and electrode implantation procedures lasted for a median of 2.0 h and 75 h, respectively. Stimulation-induced seizures and CSF leakage occurred in 13.7% and 5.9% of our cases. The mean extent of resection was 91.6%, whereas transient dysphasia occurred in 21.6% and transient hemiparesis in 5.9% of our patients, respectively. Conclusions: Extraoperative stimulation and mapping constitute a valid alternative mapping option in glioma patients who cannot undergo an awake craniotomy.

N2  -  Objective: Eloquent neural structures including white matter tracts surround the trigone of the lateral ventricle. Surgical resection of trigonal tumors via the transparietal approach may cause neurological deterioration depending on the trajectory.
Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed patients with trigonal tumors that underwent combined preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and optic radiation tractography to guide a transparietal approach towards the trigone.; Results: Five patients underwent preoperative nTMS motor mapping, rTMS language mapping, nTMSderived corticospinal tract tractography, and optic radiation tractography. The information was used to select the optimal trajectory for a transparietal approach and for intraoperative neuronavigation. Four patients underwent surgical resection. None of them experienced a new permanent deficit.; Conclusion: Combination of preoperative nTMS and optic radiation tractography facilitates the identification of the optimal parietal trajectory towards the trigone. It allows for sparing of visual and motor pathways as well as cortical language areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Anterior capsulotomy that surgically targets fiber tracts connecting prefrontal cortex and subcortical nuclei is a therapeutic option for a subgroup of patients with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. The goal of this study was to investigate neural correlates to anterior capsulotomy and find predictors of clinical improvement following this procedure.
METHODS: Structural and diffusion imaging data and clinical evaluation were acquired from 31 patients with refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder who underwent anterior capsulotomy. Of the 31 patients, 16 were clinical responders defined by a $35% reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. Analysis of variance was applied on 2 levels (surgery and response) to examine alterations of gray matter volume and fiber tract integrity (measured by generalized fractional anisotropy). The correlation between preoperative data and clinical response was further investigated.; RESULTS: After surgery, generalized fractional anisotropy was significantly decreased in the bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule and anterior thalamic radiation, accompanied by a decrease in gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum. Moreover, atrophy of the right caudate was greater in responders than in nonresponders, which correlated with alteration in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score. In addition, preoperative gray matter volume in the right inferior frontal gyrus and generalized fractional anisotropy in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and right cingulum predicted improved response. More anterior location of the lesion area predicted better clinical response.; CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that reduced volume of the right caudate might be associated with therapeutic response of capsulotomy and might offer a potential predictor of treatment outcome and a guide for lesion site.

N2  -  Production of fluent speech in humans is based on a precise and coordinated articulation of sounds. A speech articulation network (SAN) has been observed in multiple brain studies typically using either neuroimaging or direct electrical stimulation (DES), thus giving limited knowledge about the whole brain structural and functional organization of this network. In this study, seven right-handed patients underwent awake surgery resection of low-grade gliomas (4) and cavernous angiomas. We combined pre-surgical resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI together with speech arrest sites obtained intra-operatively with DES to address the following goals: (i) determine the cortical areas contributing to the intrinsic functional SAN using the speech arrest sites as functional seeds for rs-fMRI; (ii) evaluate the relative contribution of gray matter terminations from the two major language dorsal stream bundles, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III) and the arcuate fasciculus (AF); and (iii) evaluate the possible pre-surgical prediction of SAN with rs-fMRI. In all these right-handed patients the intrinsic functional SAN included frontal, inferior parietal, temporal, and insular regions symmetrically and bilaterally distributed across the two hemispheres regardless of the side (four right) of speech arrest evocation. The SLF III provided a much higher density of terminations in the cortical regions of SAN in respect to AF. Pre-surgical rs-fMRI data demonstrated moderate ability to predict the SAN. The set of functional and structural data provided in this multimodal study characterized, at a whole-brain level, a distributed and bi-hemispherical network subserving speech articulation.

N2  -  Objective: Stereotactic ablation (cingulotomy) and subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation (SCC DBS) of different regions of the cingulum bundle (CB) have been successfully used to treat psychiatric disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder. They are hypothesized to work by disrupting white matter pathways involved in the clinical manifestation of these disorders. This study aims to compare the connectivity of different CB sub-regions using tractography to evaluate stereotactic targets for the treatment of mood disorders.
Methods: Fourteen healthy volunteers underwent 3T-MR imaging followed by connectivity analysis using probabilistic tractography. Twenty-one anatomic regions of interest were defined for each subject 10 CB sub-regions (including the classical cingulotomy and SCC DBS targets) and 11 corticalsubcortical structures implicated in mood disorders. Connectivity results were compared using Friedman and Bonferroni-corrected posthoc Wilcoxon tests.; Results: CB connectivity showed a high degree of regional specificity. Both of the traditional stereotactic targets had widespread connectivity with discrete topology. The cingulotomy target connected primarily to the dorsomedial frontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate cortices, whereas the SCC DBS target connected mostly to the subgenual anterior cingulate and medialcentral orbitofrontal cortices. However, a region of the rostral dorsal CB, lying between these surgical targets, encompassed statistically equivalent connections to all five cortical regions.; Conclusions: The CB is associated with brain structures involved in affective disorders, and the rostral dorsal CB demonstrates connectivity that is comparable to the combined connectivity of cingulotomy and SCC DBS neurosurgical interventions. The rostral dorsal CB represents a surgical target worthy of clinical exploration for mood disorders.

N2  -  Acute ischemic stroke is recognized as a common cerebral vascular disease in aging people. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment can effectively improve the blood supply of the ischemic area and reduce the risk of disability or even death. Understanding the location and size of infarcts plays a critical role in the diagnosis decision. However, manual localization and quantification of stroke lesions are laborious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method to segment acute ischemic stroke from diffusion weighted images (DWIs) using deep 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method can efficiently utilize 3-D contextual information and automatically learn very discriminative features in an end-to-end and data-driven way. To relieve the difficulty of training very deep 3-D CNN, we equip our network with dense connectivity to enable the unimpeded propagation of information and gradients throughout the network. We train our model with Dice objective function to combat the severe class imbalance problem in data. A DWI data set containing 242 subjects (90 for training, 62 for validation, and 90 for testing) with various types of acute ischemic stroke was constructed to evaluate our method. Our model achieved high performance on various metrics (Dice similarity coefficient: 79.13%, lesionwise precision: 92.67%, and lesionwise F1 score: 89.25%), outperforming the other state-of- the-art CNN methods by a large margin. We also evaluated the model on ISLES2015-SSIS data set and achieved very competitive performance, which further demonstrated its generalization capacity. The proposed method is fast and accurate, demonstrating a good potential in clinical routines.

N2  -  Brainstem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) represent 2% to 7% of all brain AVMs.(1-3) Compared with other locations, a greater proportion present with hemorrhage and subsequently have a worse prognosis.(2,4)
Surgery has been associated with poor outcomes,(5,6) with parenchymal AVMs associated with higher rates of incomplete resection and morbidity compared with subpial type.7 Concerns over latency from radiosurgery to obliteration after hemorrhage, potential for incomplete obliteration, and risk of adverse radiation effects are cited by proponents of surgery.(6-9) Limited access to the anterior brainstem and difficulty controlling deep feeders add to the complexity of surgery. Previous authors have recommended occlusion in situ for parenchymal brainstem AVMs.(9,10) We present a case showing microsurgical management of a parenchymal midbrain AVM.; The patient, 46-year-old man, presented with an acute headache and diplopia following hemorrhage 1 year prior. Examination revealed bilateral ptosis, conjugate upgaze palsy, right abduction paresis, and normal light and accommodation reflexes in keeping with a dorsal midbrain lesion. Magnetic resonance and digital subtraction angiography confirmed a compact midbrain AVM (1.6 cm) extending from the pulvinar thalamus to the right quadrigeminal plate, supplied by posterior thalamoperforating, right posteromedial choroidal and branches of the P3 segment and SCA posteriorly, and drainage by the vein of Galen. Tractography showed displacement of the long tracts. A combination of a posteroanterior microsurgical approach and selective anteroposterior embolization of feeders allowed complete resection with no new deficits. The patient consented to the procedure.; We demonstrated that brainstem AVMs can safely be resected in experienced hands, with selective preoperative embolization, use of indocyanine videoangiography, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. The patient signed the Institutional Consent Form, which states that he accepts the procedure and allows the use his images and videos for any type of medical publications in conferences andor scientific articles.

N2  -  Objective To develop an augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation system with Web cameras and examine its clinical utility.
Methods The utility of the system was evaluated in three patients with brain tumors. One patient had a glioblastoma and two patients had convexity meningiomas. Our navigation system comprised the open-source software 3D Slicer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA), the infrared optical tracking sensor Polaris (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Canada), and Web cameras. We prepared two different types of Web cameras: a handheld type and a headband type. Optical markers were attached to each Web camera. We used this system for skin incision planning before the operation, during craniotomy, and after dural incision.; Results We were able to overlay these images in all cases. In Case 1, accuracy could not be evaluated because the tumor was not on the surface, though it was generally suitable for the outline of the external ear and the skin. In Cases 2 and 3, the augmented reality error was similar to 2 to 3 mm.; Conclusion AR technology was examined with Web cameras in neurosurgical operations. Our results suggest that this technology is clinically useful in neurosurgical procedures, particularly for brain tumors close to the brain surface.

All 10 children underwent pontine tumour resection through a trans-cerebellomedullary fissure approach; 4 children underwent preoperative diffusion tensor imaging scans to determine the relationship between the tumour and facial nerve nucleus, and the other 6 children underwent intraoperative deep electroencephalography (EEG) tumour monitoring, in which the tumour electrical discharge activity of the tumour was recorded. A voxel distribution map was established to describe the distribution of the tumour location, and patient prognosis was evaluated through clinical and imaging follow-up.ResultsAll 10 children achieved total tumour resection; 9 tumours were pathologically suggested to be ganglioglioma (WHO grade I), and 1 was a hamartoma. The symptoms of the original ocular dyskinesia and hemifacial spasm disappeared immediately after the operation. The children were followed up for 4-75 months, and none of the symptoms recurred; four cases with preoperative diffusion tensor imaging showed that the tumour was close to the facial nerve. Four in six intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring showed that the tumour had electrical discharge behaviour, and the tumour distribution map indicates a high density of tumour presence in the facial nerve nucleus and the nucleus of the abducens nerve.ConclusionsIn paediatric patients, the facial symptoms are related to the location and abnormal electrical discharge of the tumour. There is no significant correlation between ocular dyskinesia and the location of the tumour. Conventional antiepileptic therapy for this disease is ineffective, and early surgical intervention for total tumour resection can achieve a clinical curative effect.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-
For patients with large vessel occlusion, neuroimaging biomarkers that evaluate the changes in brain tissue are important for determining the indications for mechanical thrombectomy. In this study, we applied deep learning to derive imaging features from pretreatment diffusion-weighted image data and evaluated the ability of these features in predicting clinical outcomes for patients with large vessel occlusion.; Methods-; This multicenter retrospective study included patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy between 2013 and 2018. We designed a 2-output deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (the convolutional neural network model). This model employed encoder-decoder architecture for the ischemic lesion segmentation, which automatically extracted high-level feature maps in its middle layers, and used its information to predict the clinical outcome. Its performance was internally validated with 5-fold cross-validation, externally validated, and the results compared with those from the standard neuroimaging biomarkers Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and ischemic core volume. The prediction target was a good clinical outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score at 90-day follow-up of 0 to 2.; Results-; The derivation cohort included 250 patients, and the validation cohort included 74 patients. The convolutional neural network model showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.81 +- 0.06 compared with 0.63 +- 0.05 and 0.64 +- 0.05 for the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and ischemic core volume models, respectively. In the external validation, the area under the curve for the convolutional neural network model was significantly superior to those for the other 2 models.; Conclusions-; Compared with the standard neuroimaging biomarkers, our deep learning model derived a greater amount of prognostic information from pretreatment neuroimaging data. Although a confirmatory prospective evaluation is needed, the high-level imaging features derived by deep learning may offer an effective prognostic imaging biomarker.

N2  -  Knowledge about the recovery of oral intake after hemispheric stroke is important to guide therapeutic decisions, including the administration of enteral tube feeding and the choice of the appropriate feeding route. They aimed to determine the localization and connectivity of lesions in impaired recovery versus recovered swallowing after initially dysphagic stroke. Sixty-two acute ischemic hemispheric stroke patients with impaired oral intake were included in a prospective observational cohort study. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and probabilistic tractography were used to determine the association of lesion location and connectivity with impaired recovery of oral intake >= 7 days (indication for early tube feeding) and >= 4 weeks (indication for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding) after stroke. Two distinct patterns influencing recovery of swallowing were recognized. Firstly, impaired recovery of oral intake after >= 7 days was significantly associated with lesions of the superior corona radiata (65% of statistical map, P<0.05). The affected fibers were connected with the thalamus, primary motor, and supplemental motor areas and the basal ganglia. Secondly, impaired recovery of oral intake after >= 4 weeks significantly correlated with lesions of the anterior insula (54% of statistical map, P<0.05), which was connected to adjacent operculo-insular areas of deglutition. These findings indicate that early swallowing recovery is influenced by white matter lesions disrupting thalamic and corticobulbar projection fibers. Late recovery is determined by specific cortical lesions affecting association fibers. This knowledge may help clinicians to identify patients at risk of prolonged swallowing problems that would benefit from enteral tube feeding. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Advances in imaging, including multivoxel spectroscopy, tractography, functional MRI and positron emission spectroscopy, are being used by neurosurgeons to target aggressive areas in gliomas, and to help identify tumour boundaries, functional areas and tracts. Neuro-oncological surgeons need to understand these techniques to help maximise tumour resection, while minimising morbidity in an attempt to improve the quality of patient outcome. This article reviews the evidence for the practical use of multimodal imaging in modern glioma surgery.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: During image-guided neurosurgery, if the surgeon is not fully orientated to the surgical position, he or she will briefly shift attention toward the visualization interface of an image guidance station, receiving only momentary "point-in-space" information. The aim of this study was to develop a novel visual interface for neuronavigation during brain tumor surgery, enabling intraoperative feedback on the entire progress of surgery relative to the anatomy of the brain and its pathology, regardless of the interval at which the surgeon chooses to look.
METHODS: New software written in Java (Sun Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was developed to visualize the Cumulative recorded instrument positions intraoperatively. This allowed surgeons to see all previous instrument positions during the elapsed surgery. This new interactive interface was then used in 17 frameless image-guided neurosurgical procedures. The purpose of the first 11 cases was to obtain clinical experience with this new interface. In these cases, workflow and volumetric feedback (WVF) were available at the surgeons' discretion (Protocol A). In the next 6 cases, WVF was provided only after a complete resection was claimed (Protocol B).; RESULTS: With the novel interactive interface, dynamics of surgical resection, displacement of cortical anatomy, and digitized functional data could be visualized intraoperatively. In the first group (Protocol A), surgeons expressed the view that WVF had affected their decision making and aided resection 0 0 of I I cases). In 3 of 6 cases in the second group (Protocol B), tumor resections were extended after evaluation of WVF By digitizing the cortical surface, an impression of the cortical shift could be acquired in all 17 cases. The maximal cortical shift measured 20 mm, but it typically varied between 0 and 10 mm.; CONCLUSION: Our first clinical results suggest that the embedding of WVF contributes to improvement of surgical awareness and tumor resection in image-guided neurosurgery in a swift and simple manner.

N2  -  High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is invaluable for identifying cerebral tumors that cause epilepsy. Serial voxel-based automated quantitative analyses are more sensitive than visual reading for detecting change in a lesion. Eloquent cortex can be identified with functional MRI (fMRI), with cautions about the precise location and extent of critical cortex. Tractography is useful for delineating critical white matter tracks as are MR venography and computerized tomography (CT) angiography for displaying veins and arteries. These data may be combined into a three-dimensional (3D) multimodal MR data presentation and displayed interoperatively to increase the precision and minimize the risk of neurosurgical treatment, and for the illustrations.

N2  -  Modern glioma surgery has evolved from the principal belief that safe, maximal tumor resection improves symptom management, quality of life, progression-free survival, and overall survival in both low-grade and high-grade glioma. However, in the absence of level I data, the overwhelming support for this idea is derived largely from retrospective series. As a result, the influence of increasing extent of resection and reducing tumor burden on the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and survival, remains inadequately defined. This situation is particularly true because gliomas represent a widely heterogeneous group of tumors with varying behaviors and prognoses rooted in their complex molecular profile. The neurosurgical community has made a large effort to define the clinical benefits of maximizing tumor resection, with particular attention paid to the ever-evolving understanding of glioma molecular heterogeneity. Important new technologies have been developed concurrently to mitigate neurologic risks related to the pursuit of maximizing extent of resection. These advances reflect the modern goal of glioma surgery to find the optimal balance between tumor removal and neurologic compromise. We review the current literature supporting safe, maximal resection for gliomas.

N2  -  The importance of maximal resection in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) has been reported in many studies, but maximal resection of thalamic GBM is rarely attempted due to high rate of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of surgical resection in adult thalamic glioblastoma (GBM) treatment and to identify the surgical technique of maximal safety resection. In case of suspected thalamic GBM, surgical resection is the treatment of choice in our hospital. Biopsy was considered when there was ventricle wall enhancement or multiple enhancement lesion in a distant location. Navigation magnetic resonance imaging, diffuse tensor tractography imaging, tailed bullets, and intraoperative computed tomography and neurophysiologic monitoring (transcranial motor evoked potential and direct subcortical stimulation) were used in all surgical resection cases. The surgical approach was selected on the basis of the location of the tumor epicenter and the adjacent corticospinal tract. Among the 42 patients, 19 and 23 patients underwent surgical resection and biopsy, respectively, according to treatment strategy criteria. As a result, the surgical resection group exhibited a good response with overall survival (OS) (median: 676 days, p < 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (median: 328 days, p < 0.001) compared with each biopsy groups (doctor selecting biopsy group, median OS: 240 days and median PFS: 134 days; patient selecting biopsy group, median OS: 212 days and median PFS: 118 days). The surgical resection groups displayed a better prognosis compared to that of the biopsy groups for both the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase unmethylated (log-rank p = 0.0035) or methylated groups (log-rank p = 0.021). Surgical resection was significantly associated with better prognosis (hazard ratio: 0.214, p = 0.006). In case of thalamic GBM without ventricle wall-enhancing lesion or multiple lesions, maximal surgical resection above 80% showed good clinical outcomes with prolonged the overall survival compared to biopsy. It is helpful to use adjuvant surgical techniques of checking intraoperative changes and select the appropriate surgical approach for reducing the surgical morbidity.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: In acute stroke, the DWI-FLAIR mismatch allows for the allocation of patients to the thrombolysis window (<4.5 hours). FLAIR-lesions, however, may be challenging to assess. In comparison, DWI may be a useful bio-marker owing to high lesion contrast. We investigated the performance of a relative DWI signal intensity (rSI) threshold to predict the presence of FLAIR-lesions in acute stroke and analyzed its association with time-from-stroke-onset.
Methods: In a retrospective, dual-center MR-imaging study we included patients with acute stroke and time-from-stroke-onset <= 12 hours (group A: n = 49, 1.5T; group B: n = 48, 3T). DW- and FLAIR-images were coregistered. The largest lesion extent in DWI defined the slice for further analysis. FLAIR-lesions were identified by 3 raters, delineated as regions-of-interest (ROIs) and copied on the DW-images. Circular ROIs were placed within the DWI-lesion and labeled according to the FLAIR-pattern (FLAIR+ or FLAIR-). ROI-values were normalized to the unaffected hemisphere. Adjusted and nonadjusted receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curve analysis on patient level was performed to analyze the ability of a DWI- and ADC-rSI threshold to predict the presence of FLAIR-lesions. Spearman correlation and adjusted linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between DWI-intensity and time-from-stroke-onset.; Results: DWI-rSI performed well in predicting lesions in FLAIR-imaging (mean area under the curve (AUC): group A: 0.84; group B: 0.85). An optimal mean DWI-rSI threshold was identified (A: 162%; B: 161%). ADC-maps performed worse (mean AUC: A: 0.58; B: 0.77). Adjusted regression models confirmed the superior performance of DWI-rSI. Correlation coefficents and linear regression showed a good association with time-from-stroke-onset for DWI-rSI, but not for ADC-rSI.; Conclusion: An easily assessable DWI-rSI threshold identifies the presence of lesions in FLAIR-imaging with good accuracy and is associated with time-from-stroke-onset in acute stroke. This finding underlines the potential of a DWI-rSI threshold as a marker of lesion age.

N2  -  Significant carotid stenosis is known to cause ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment. However, it remains controversial whether carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can improve cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to compare cognitive function between before and after CEA. Patients were prospectively registered to evaluate cognitive function from October 2011 to December 2012 after we determined them to have significant carotid stenosis. Patients were examined by 3-dimensional computed tomographic angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Although symptomatic cases were included, their modified Rankin Scale was grade 0 or 1 before CEA. All CEA procedures were performed by the same neurosurgical team. Cognitive function was evaluated by MoCA and MMSE performed before and after surgery. Data were analyzed statistically using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Thirty-six patients were included in this study. The MoCA score after surgery, whereas the MMSE score was not. After surgery, the MoCA score improved in patients who were 73 years or younger, who underwent CEA in the left side of their carotid lesion, who had severe carotid stenosis of more than 80%, who had bilateral lesion, who did not have abnormal lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging after surgery, or who had cerebral blood flow of pre-CEA over 34.5 mL. In conclusion, MoCA was feasible in patients soon after undergoing CEA. Using MoCA not MMSE, CEA may improve cognitive function in patients with significant carotid stenosis.

N2  -  The role of massa intermedia (MI) is poorly understood in humans. Recent studies suggest its presence may play a role in normal human neurocognitive function while prior studies have shown the absence of MI correlated with psychiatric disorders. There is growing evidence that MI is likely a midline white matter conduit, responsible for interhemispheric connectivity, similar to other midline commissures. MI presence was identified in an unrelated sample using the Human Connectome Project database. MI structural connectivity maps were created and gray matter target regions were identified using probabilistic tractography of the whole brain. Probabilistic tractography revealed an extensive network of connections between MI and limbic, frontal and temporal lobes as well as insula and pericalcarine cortices. Women compared to men had stronger connectivity via their MI. The presented results support the role of MI as a midline commissure with strong connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Gross total resection (GTR) prolongs survival but is unfortunately not achievable in the majority of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Cytoreductive debulkings may relieve symptoms of mass effect, but it is unknown how long such effects sustain and to what degree the potential benefits exceed risks. We explore the impact of surgical morbidity on functional outcome and survival in unselected GBM patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively included 144 consecutive adult patients operated on for primary GBM at a single institution between 2004 and 2009. Reporting of adverse events was done in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.; RESULTS: A total of 141 (98%) operations were resections and 3 (2%) were biopsies. A decrease in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores was observed in 39% of patients after 6 weeks. There was a significant decrease between pre- and postoperative KPS scores (P < 0.001). Twenty-two (15.3%) patients had surgically acquired neurological deficits. Among patients who underwent surgical resection, those with surgically acquired neurological deficits were less likely to receive radiotherapy (P < 0.001), normofractioned radiotherapy (P = 0.010), and chemotherapy (P = 0.003). Twenty-eight (19.4%) patients had perioperative complications. Among patients who underwent surgical resection, those with perioperative complications were less likely to receive normofractioned radiotherapy (P = 0.010) and chemotherapy (P = 0.009). Age (P = 0.019), surgically acquired neurological deficits (P < 0.001), and surgical complications (P = 0.006) were significant predictors for worsened functional outcome after 6 weeks. GTR (P = 0.035), perioperative complications (P = 0.008), radiotherapy (P < 0.001), and chemotherapy (P = 0.045) were independent factors associated with 12-month postoperative survival.; CONCLUSION: Patients with perioperative complications and surgically acquired deficits were less likely to receive adjuvant therapy. While cytoreductive debulking may not improve survival in GBM, it may decrease the likelihood of patients receiving adjuvant therapy that does.

N2  -  Background Intraoperative stimulation (IS) mapping has become the preferred standard treatment for eloquent tumors as it permits a more accurate identification of functional areas, allowing surgeons to achieve higher extents of resection (EOR) and decrease postoperative morbidity. For lesions adjacent to the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts, mapping can be done with both awake craniotomy (AC) and under general anesthesia (GA). Objective We aimed to determine which anesthetic protocol-AC vs. GA-provides better patient outcomes by comparing EOR and postoperative morbidity for surgeries using IS mapping in gliomas located near or in motor areas of the brain. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out to identify relevant studies from 1983 to 2019. Seven databases were screened. A total of 2351 glioma patients from 17 studies were analyzed. Results A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a trend towards a higher mean EOR in AC [90.1% (95% C.I. 85.8-93.8)] than with GA [81.7% (95% C.I. 72.4-89.7)] (p = 0.06). Neurological deficits were divided by timing and severity for analysis. There was no significant difference in early neurological deficits [20.9% (95% C.I. 4.1-45.0) vs. 25.4% (95% C.I. 13.6-39.2)] (p = 0.74), late neurological deficits [17.1% (95% C.I. 0.0-50.0) vs. 3.8% (95% C.I. 1.1-7.6)] (p = 0.06), or in non-severe [28.4% (95% C.I. 0.0-88.5) vs. 20.1% (95% C.I. 7.1-32.2)] (p = 0.72), and severe morbidity [2.6% (95% C.I. 0.0-15.5) vs. 4.5% (95% C.I. 1.1-9.6)] (p = 0.89) between patients who underwent AC versus GA, respectively. Conclusion Mapping during resection of gliomas located in or near the perirolandic area and descending motor tracts can be safely carried out with both AC and GA.

N2  -  IntroductionMR-tractography is increasingly used in neurosurgical practice to evaluate the anatomical relationships between glioma and nearby subcortical tracts. In some patients, the subcortical tracts seem displaced by the glioma, while in other patients, the subcortical tracts seem infiltrated without displacement. At this point, it is unknown whether these different patterns are related to tumor type. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate whether tumor type is related to the spatial tractography pattern of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) in low-grade gliomas (LGGs).MethodsIn 64 IDH-mutated LGG patients, the FAT was generated using a pipeline for automatic tractography. In 41 patients, the glioma adjoined the FAT, and four blinded reviewers independently assessed the following two dichotomous categories (yes/no): (i) glioma displaces the tract, and (ii) glioma infiltrates the tract.ResultsFisher's exact tests demonstrated strong and significant positive associations between displacement and astrocytomas (p = .002, phi = .497) and infiltration and oligodendrogliomas (p = .004, phi = .484). The interobserver agreement was good for both categories: (i) kappa = 0.76 and (ii) kappa = 0.71.ConclusionHigh sensitivity but low specificity for displacement in astrocytomas demonstrates that in the case of an astrocytoma, the tract is most likely displaced, but that displacement in itself is not necessarily predictive for astrocytomas, as oligodendrogliomas may both infiltrate and displace a tract. Overall, these results demonstrate that oligodendrogliomas tend to infiltrate the nearby subcortical tract, whereas astrocytomas only tend to displace it.

N2  -  The development of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has provided a new therapeutic tool for neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast to previously available neurosurgical techniques, MRgFUS allows precise impact on deep brain structures without the need for incision and yields an immediate effect. In its high-intensity modality (MRgHIFU), it produces accurate therapeutic thermoablation in previously selected brain targets. Importantly, the production of the lesion is progressive and highly controlled in real-time by both neuroimaging and clinical means. MRgHIFU ablation is already an accepted and widely used treatment for medically-refractory Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Notably, other neurological disorders and diverse brain targets, including bilateral treatments, are currently under examination. Conversely, the low-intensity modality (MRgLIFU) shows promising prospects in neuromodulation and transient blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO). In the former circumstance, MRgLIFU could serve as a powerful clinical and research tool for non-invasively modulating brain activity and function. BBBO, on the other hand, emerges as a potentially impactful method to influence disease pathogenesis and progression by increasing brain target engagement of putative therapeutic agents. While promising, these applications remain experimental. As a recently developed technology, MRgFUS is not without challenges and questions to be addressed. Further developments and broader experience are necessary to enhance MRgFUS capabilities in both research and clinical practice, as well as to define device constraints. This clinical mini-review aims to provide an overview of the main evidence of MRgFUS application and to highlight unmet needs and future potentialities of the technique.

N2  -  The hub-and-spoke semantic representation theory posits that semantic knowledge is processed in a neural network, which contains an amodal hub, the sensorimotor modality-specific regions, and the connections between them. The exact neural basis of the hub, regions and connectivity remains unclear. Semantic dementia could be an ideal lesion model to construct the semantic network as this disease presents both amodal and modality-specific semantic processing (e.g. colour) deficits. The goal of the present study was to identify, using an unbiased data-driven approach, the semantic hub and its general and modality-specific semantic white matter connections by investigating the relationship between the lesion degree of the network and the severity of semantic deficits in 33 patients with semantic dementia. Data of diffusion-weighted imaging and behavioural performance in processing knowledge of general semantic and six sensorimotor modalities (i.e. object form, colour, motion, sound, manipulation and function) were collected from each subject. Specifically, to identify the semantic hub, we mapped the white matter nodal degree value (a graph theoretical index) of the 90 regions in the automated anatomical labelling atlas with the general semantic abilities of the patients. Of the regions, only the left fusiform gyrus was identified as the hub because its structural connectivity strength (i.e. nodal degree value) could significantly predict the general semantic processing of the patients. To identify the general and modalityspecific semantic connections of the semantic hub, we separately correlated the white matter integrity values of each tract connected with the left fusiform gyrus, with the performance for general semantic processing and each of six semantic modality processing. The results showed that the hub region worked in concert with nine other regions in the semantic memory network for general semantic processing. Moreover, the connection between the hub and the left calcarine was associated with colour-specific semantic processing. The observed effects could not be accounted for by potential confounding variables (e.g. total grey matter volume, regional grey matter volume and performance on non-semantic control tasks). Our findings refine the neuroanatomical structure of the semantic network and underline the critical role of the left fusiform gyrus and its connectivity in the network.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The classic transopercular or transsylvian approach to insular gliomas removes the tumor laterally through the insular cortex. This study describes a new anteroposterior approach through the frontal isthmus for insular glioma surgery.METHODS The authors detailed the surgical techniques for resection of insular gliomas through the transfrontal isthmus approach. Fifty-nine insular gliomas with at least Berger-Sanai zone I involvement were removed with the new approach, and extent of resection and postoperative neurological outcomes were assessed.RESULTS Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, including 35 men and 24 women, with a mean (range) age 44.3 (19-75) years. According to the Berger-Sanai classification system, the most common tumor was a giant glioma (67.8%), followed by involvement of zones I and IV (18.6%). Twenty-two cases were Yasargil type 3A/B, and 37 cases were Yasargil type 5A/B. The average angle between the lateral plane of the putamen and sagittal line was 33.53 & DEG;, and the average width of the isthmus near the anterior insular point was 33.33 mm. The average angle between the lateral plane of the putamen and the sagittal line was positively correlated with the width of the isthmus near the anterior insular point (r = 0.935, p < 0.0001). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) preoperative tumor volume was 67.82 (57.64-92.19) cm3. Of 39 low-grade gliomas, 26 (66.67%) were totally resected; of 20 high-grade gliomas, 19 (95%) were totally resected. The median (IQR) extent of resection of the whole group was 100% (73.7%-100%). Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging showed no cases of middle cerebral artery- or lenticulostriate artery-related stroke. Extent of insular tumor resection was positively correlated with the angle of the lateral plane of the putamen and sagittal line (r = -0.329, p = 0.011) and the width of the isthmus near the anterior insular point (r = -0.267, p = 0.041). At 3 months postoperatively, muscle strength grade exceeded 4 in all cases, and all patients exhibited essentially normal speech. The median (IQR) Karnofsky performance score at 3 months after surgery was 90 (80-90).CONCLUSIONS The transfrontal isthmus approach changes the working angle from lateral-medial to anterior-posterior, allowing for maximal safe removal of insular gliomas.

N2  -  Background: Edema of the cerebellum with secondary obstructive hydrocephalus is a rare presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy. The authors report an unusual case of isolated posterior fossa swelling with upward transtentorial herniation and hydrocephalus causing neurologic deterioration. These patients are often initially evaluated by a neurologist because of the acute neurologic symptoms. Prompt diagnosis with aggressive blood pressure control may obviate the need for emergent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion.
Review Summary: This is a case report of a 26-year-old man who presented to the emergency room with confusion and somnolence over a 2-day period. His initial blood pressure was 175110 mmHg. On examination he was disoriented, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 points, opening his eyes only to loud verbal stimuli, verbalizing inappropriately, and he was only able to follow simple commands. Neuroimaging revealed edema of the cerebellar folia with noncommunicating hydrocephalus and upward transtentorial herniation. Differential diagnoses of posterior fossa tumor, rhombencephalitis, and hypertensive encephalopathy were entertained. A thorough literature review is included with the discussion of this case. The patient underwent emergent ventriculostomy for CSF drainage and prompt blood pressure control with nitroprusside. After 48 hours of CSF drainage and correction of his hypertension, his neurologic examination normalized. Repeat imaging revealed near resolution of the obstructive hydrocephalus and cerebellar edema.; Conclusion: Isolated edema of the cerebellum with upward transtentorial herniation and obstructive hydrocephalus is a rare presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy and should be considered in patients with an acute hypertensive crisis and mental status changes. This entity responds to prompt blood pressure control; however, emergent ventriculostomy by a neurosurgical team should be entertained for neurologic deterioration secondary to significant obstructive hydrocephalus, as illustrated in this case.

N2  -  Introduction: Damage to white matter tracts can cause severe neurological deficits, which are often hardly predictable before brain tumor surgery. To explore the possibility of assessing white matter integrity and its preservation, we chose the frontal aslant tract (FAT) due to its involvement in multiple neurological functions such as speech and movement initiation.Methods: Right-handed patients with left hemispheric intracerebral tumors underwent FAT tractography within 7 days before and 3 days after surgery. Neurological performance score and aphasia score were assessed within 7 days before and after surgery, as well as at follow-up 3 months postoperatively.Results: Fifteen patients were prospectively analyzed. After multivariate analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis, we found that preoperative fractional anisotropy (FA) of the left FAT indicated the preoperative aphasia score (cutoff 0.40, p = 0.015). Aphasia scores 3 months postoperatively were predicted by both postoperative FA of the left FAT (cutoff 0.35, p = 0.005) and postoperatively preserved FA of the left FAT (cutoff 95.8%, p = 0.017). Postoperatively preserved right FAT FA inversely predicted postoperative aphasia score (cutoff 95.1%, p = 0.016).Discussion: Assessment of white matter integrity preservation is possible and correlates with outcome after brain tumor surgery. It may be useful for patient counseling and assessment of rehabilitation potential, as well as to investigate relevant brain networks in the future.Clinical Trial Registration: The trial was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04302857).
Impact statementTractography is a valuable tool for planning neurosurgical procedures. It informs the clinician of individual anatomy to tailor the surgical strategy, and it also holds great value for risk assessment before brain tumor resection. Another important question for surgeons and patients is the estimation of rehabilitation potential after surgery when neurological deterioration of some degree may have occurred. We, therefore, repeated tractography in the postoperative phase to assess postoperative damage. The results of this pilot study show that this approach is feasible and may aid in postoperative patient counseling, decision-making, and further brain network investigations.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: We describe the lateral transpeduncular approach to access lesions in the rostral pons. The surgical indications and technique are discussed in the context of an illustrative case and pertinent anatomic considerations.
METHODS: A 38-year-old man with acute right hemiparesis and bulbar symptoms had a left pontine hemorrhage with an associated cavernous malformation and venous anomaly. There was no pial or ependymal representation of the lesion. To avoid disruption of eloquent structures, the pia was entered in the posterolateral aspect of the middle cerebellar peduncle. Subsequent dissection was guided by stereotactic neuronavigation in a ventromedial trajectory along the course of the pontocerebellar fibers.; RESULTS: The cavernous malformation was resected completely without procedure-related morbidity. The patient's preoperative deficits slowly improved to a functionally independent state.; CONCLUSION: The lateral transpeduncular approach may be used to access intrinsic lesions of the rostral pons with relatively low morbidity. Stereotactic neuronavigation and intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring are important surgical adjuncts to guide dissection and lesion extirpation. Candidate selection, microsurgical technique, and pragmatic treatment goals remain fundamental to optimal patient outcomes.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Extent of resection (EOR) and residual tumor volume are linked to prognosis in low-grade glioma (LGG) and there are various methods for facilitating safe maximal resection in such patients. In this prospective study the authors assess radiological and clinical results in consecutive patients with LGG treated with 3D ultrasound (US)-guided resection under general anesthesia.
METHODS Consecutive LGGs undergoing primary surgery guided with 3D US between 2008 and 2015 were included. All LGGs were classified according to the WHO 2016 classification system. Pre- and postoperative volumetric assessments were performed, and volumetric results were linked to overall and malignant-free survival. Pre- and postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated.; RESULTS Forty-seven consecutive patients were included. Twenty LGGs (43%) were isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated, 7 (14%) were IDH wild-type, 19 (40%) had both IDH mutation and 1p19q codeletion, and 1 had IDH mutation and inconclusive 1p19q status. Median resection grade was 93.4%, with gross-total resection achieved in 14 patients (30%). An additional 24 patients (51%) had small tumor remnants < 10 ml. A more conspicuous tumor border (p = 0.02) and lower University of California San Francisco prognostic score (p = 0.01) were associated with less remnant tumor tissue, and overall survival was significantly better with remnants < 10 ml (p = 0.03). HRQoL was maintained or improved in 86% of patients at 1 month. In both cases with severe permanent deficits, relevant ischemia was present on diffusion-weighted postoperative MRI.; CONCLUSIONS Three-dimensional US-guided LGG resections under general anesthesia are safe and HRQoL is preserved in most patients. Effectiveness in terms of EOR appears to be consistent with published studies using other advanced neurosurgical tools. Avoiding intraoperative vascular injury is a key factor for achieving good functional outcome.

N2  -  The importance of large-scale brain networks in higher-order human functioning is well established in neuroscience, but has yet to deeply penetrate neurosurgical thinking due to concerns of clinical relevance. Here, we conducted the first systematic review examining the clinical importance of non-traditional, large-scale brain networks, including the default mode (DMN), central executive (CEN), salience (SN), dorsal attention (DAN), and ventral attention (VAN) networks. Studies which reported evidence of neurologic, cognitive, or emotional deficits in relation to damage or dysfunction in these networks were included. We screened 22,697 articles on PubMed, and 551 full-text articles were included and examined. Cognitive deficits were the most common symptom of network disturbances in varying amounts (36-56%), most frequently related to disruption of the DMN (n = 213) or some combination of DMN, CEN, and SN networks (n = 182). An increased proportion of motor symptoms was seen with CEN disruption (12%), and emotional (35%) or language/speech deficits (24%) with SN disruption. Disruption of the attention networks (VAN/DAN) with each other or the other networks mostly led to cognitive deficits (56%). A large body of evidence is available demonstrating the clinical importance of non-traditional, large-scale brain networks and suggests the need to preserve these networks is relevant for neurosurgical patients.

N2  -  Despite a better understanding of their anatomy, the functional role of frontal pathways, i.e., the fronto-striatal tract (FST) and frontal aslant tract (FAT), remains obscure. We studied 19 patients who underwent awake surgery for a frontal glioma (14 left, 5 right) by performing intraoperative electrical mapping of both fascicles during motor and language tasks. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between these tracts and the eventual onset of transient postoperative disorders. We also performed post-surgical tract-specific measurements on probabilistic tractography. All patients but one experienced intraoperative inhibition of movement and/or speech during subcortical electrostimulation. On postoperative tractography, the subcortical distribution of stimulated sites corresponded to the spatial course of the FST and/or FAT. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between postoperative worsening and distances between these tracts and resection cavity. A resection close to the (right or left) FST was correlated with transitory motor initiation disorders (p = 0.026), while a resection close to the left FAT was associated with transient speech initiation disorders (p = 0.003). Moreover, the measurements of average distances between resection cavity and left FAT showed a positive correlation with verbal fluency in both semantic (p = 0.019) and phonemic scores (p = 0.017), while average distances between surgical cavity and left FST showed a positive correlation with verbal fluency scores in both semantic (p = 0.0003) and phonemic modalities (p = 0.037). We suggest that FST and FAT would cooperatively play a role in self-initiated movement and speech, as a part of "negative motor network" involving the pre-supplementary motor area, left inferior frontal gyrus and caudate nucleus.

N2  -  Objective: The Klingler fiber dissection technique is a relevant and reliable method for neurosurgery to identify with accuracy the fine structure of the brain anatomy highlighting white matter tracts. In order to demonstrate the significance of the application of this technique, we aimed to observe the course and relations of the mammillothalamic and habenulo-interpeduncular tracts as there are very few papers showing these important diencephalic tracts.
Material and methods: Twelve formalin-fixed brains were dissected using the Klingler technique in order to expose the medial diencephalic surface. Diencephalic white matter tracts, particularly the mammillothalamic and habenulo-interpeduncular tracts, were dissected using wooden spatulas and metallic dissectors with different sizes and tips. Several measurements were performed in both dissected hemispheres relative to the mammillothalamic and habenulo-interpeduncular tracts.; Results: The course and length of these two tracts were visualized and the relations with other fiber systems and with the neighboring gray matter structures quantified and registered. The mammillothalamic tract approximately marks the anteroposterior coordinate of the anterior pole of the subthalamic nucleus in the anterior commissure posterior commissure plane.; Conclusion: The present study helps to understand the three-dimensional architecture of the white matter systems of tracts when the Klingler technique is used. The numerical data obtained may be helpful to neurosurgeons while approaching brain paraventricular and ventricular lesions and deep brain stimulation. Finally, the anatomical knowledge can lower surgical complications and improve patient care particularly in the field of neurosurgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  ObjectivesArtificial intelligence (AI) applications in neurosurgery have an increasing momentum as well as the growing number of implementations in the medical literature. In recent years, AI research define a link between neuroscience and AI. It is a connection between knowing and understanding the brain and how to simulate the brain. The machine learning algorithms, as a subset of AI, are able to learn with experiences, perform big data analysis, and fulfill human-like tasks. Intracranial surgical approaches that have been defined, disciplined, and developed in the last century have become more effective with technological developments. We aimed to define individual-safe, intracranial approaches by introducing functional anatomical structures and pathological areas to artificial intelligence. MethodsPreoperative MR images of patients with deeply located brain tumors were used for planning. Intracranial arteries, veins, and neural tracts are listed and numbered. Voxel values of these selected regions in cranial MR sequences were extracted and labeled. Tumor tissue was segmented as the target. Q-learning algorithm which is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm was run on labeled voxel values (on optimal paths extracted from the new heuristic-based path planning algorithm), then the algorithm was assigned to list the cortico-tumoral pathways that aim to remove the maximum tumor tissue and in the meantime that functional anatomical tissues will be least affected. ResultsThe most suitable cranial entry areas were found with the artificial intelligence algorithm. Cortico-tumoral pathways were revealed using Q-learning from these optimal points. ConclusionsAI will make a significant contribution to the positive outcomes as its use in both preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative technique equipment assisted neurosurgery, its use increased.

N2  -  Objectives
To apply the MB (multiband) excitation and blipped-CAIPI (blipped-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging) techniques in a spin and gradient-echo (SAGE) EPI sequence to improve the slice coverage for vessel architecture imaging (VAI).; Materials and methods; Both MB excitation and blipped-CAIPI with in-plane parallel imaging were incorporated into a gradient-echo (GE)spin-echo (SE) EPI sequence for simultaneous tracking of the dynamic MR signal changes in both GE and SE contrasts after the injection of contrast agent. MB and singleband (SB) excitation were compared using a 20-channel head coil at 3 Tesla, and high-resolution MB VAI could be performed in 32 glioma patients.; Results; Whole-brain covered high resolution VAI can be achieved after applying multiband excitation with a factor of 2 and in-plane parallel imaging with a factor of 3. The quality of the images resulting from MB acceleration was comparable to those from the SB method: images were reconstructed without any loss of spatial resolution or severe distortions. In addition, MB and SB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were similar. A relative low g-factor induced from the MB acceleration method was achieved after using a blipped-CAIPI technique (1.35 for GE and 1.33 for SE imaging). Performing quantitative VAI, we found that, among all VAI parametric maps, microvessel type indicator (MTI), distance map (I) and vascular-induced bolus peak-time shift (VIPS) were highly correlated. Likewise, VAI parametric maps of slope, slope length and short axis were highly correlated.; Conclusions; Multiband accelerated SAGE successfully doubles the number of readout slices in the same measurement time when compared to conventional readout sequences. The corresponding VAI parametric maps provide insights into the complexity and heterogeneity of vascular changes in glioma.

N2  -  Background: Awake craniotomy with intraoperative stimulation has been utilized in glioma surgical resection to preserve the quality of life. Epilepsy may occur in 5-20% of cases, leading to severe consequences. This study aimed to discuss the mechanism of intraoperative stimulation-related epilepsy (ISE) using DTI-based graph theoretical analysis. Methods: Twenty patients with motor-area glioma were enrolled and divided into two groups (Ep and nEp) according to the presence of ISE. Additionally, a group of 10 healthy participants matched by age, sex, and years of education was also included. All participants underwent T1, T2, and DTI examinations. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to reveal the topological characteristics of white matter networks. Results: Three connections were found to be significantly lower in at least one weighting in the Ep group. These connections were between A1/2/3truL and A4ulL, A1/2/3truR and A4tR, and A6mL and A6mR. Global efficiency was significantly decreased, while the shortest path length increased in the Ep group in at least one weighting. Ten nodes exhibited significant differences in nodal efficiency and degree centrality analyses. The nodes A6mL and A6mR showed a marked decrease in total four weightings in the Ep group. Conclusions: The hub nodes A6mL and A6mR are disconnected in patients with ISE, causing subsequent lower efficiency of global and regional networks. These findings provide a basis for presurgical assessment of ISE, for which caution should be taken when it involves hub nodes during intraoperative electrical stimulation.

N2  -  Wernicke (Der aphasische Symptomencomplex: Eine psychologische Studie auf anatomischer Basis. Cohn und Weigert, Breslau. https://wellcomecollection.org/works/dwv5w9rw, 1874) proposed a model of the functional neuroanatomy of spoken word repetition, production, and comprehension. At the heart of this epoch-making model are psychological reflex arcs underpinned by fiber tracts connecting sensory to motor areas. Here, I evaluate the central assumption of psychological reflex arcs in light of what we have learned about language in the brain during the past 150 years. I first describe Wernicke's 1874 model and the evidence he presented for it. Next, I discuss his updates of the model published in 1886 and posthumously in 1906. Although the model had an enormous immediate impact, it lost influence after the First World War. Unresolved issues included the anatomical underpinnings of the psychological reflex arcs, the role of auditory images in word production, and the sufficiency of psychological reflex arcs, which was questioned by Wundt (Grundzuge der physiologischen Psychologie. Engelmann, Leipzig. http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/references?id=lit46, 1874; Grundzuge der physiologischen Psychologie (Vol. 1, 5th ed.). Engelmann, Leipzig. http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/references?id=lit806, 1902). After a long dormant period, Wernicke's model was revived by Geschwind (Science 170:940-944. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.170.3961.940, 1970; Selected papers on language and the brain. Reidel, Dordrecht, 1974), who proposed a version of it that differed in several important respects from Wernicke's original. Finally, I describe how new evidence from modern research has led to a novel view on language in the brain, supplementing contemporary equivalents of psychological reflex arcs by other mechanisms such as attentional control and assuming different neuroanatomical underpinnings. In support of this novel view, I report new analyses of patient data and computer simulations using the WEAVER++/ARC model (Roelofs 2014, 2022) that incorporates attentional control and integrates the new evidence.

N2  -  Background: For stereotactic brain biopsy involving motor eloquent regions, the surgical objective is to enhance diagnostic yield and preserve neurological function. To achieve this aim, we implemented functional neuro-navigation and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) into the biopsy procedure. The impact of this integrated technique on the surgical outcome and postoperative neurological function was investigated and evaluated.
Method: Thirty nine patients with lesions involving motor eloquent structures underwent frameless stereotactic biopsy assisted by functional neuro-navigation and iMRI. Intraoperative visualisation was realised by integrating anatomical and functional information into a navigation framework to improve biopsy trajectories and preserve eloquent structures. iMRI was conducted to guarantee the biopsy accuracy and detect intraoperative complications. The perioperative change of motor function and biopsy error before and after iMRI were recorded, and the role of functional information in trajectory selection and the relationship between the distance from sampling site to nearby eloquent structures and the neurological deterioration were further analyzed.; Results: Functional neuro-navigation helped modify the original trajectories and sampling sites in 35.90% (1639) of cases to avoid the damage of eloquent structures. Even though all the lesions were high-risk of causing neurological deficits, no significant difference was found between preoperative and postoperative muscle strength. After data analysis, 3mm was supposed to be the safe distance for avoiding transient neurological deterioration. During surgery, the use of iMRI significantly reduced the biopsy errors (p = 0.042) and potentially increased the diagnostic yield from 84.62% (3339) to 94.87% (3739). Moreover, iMRI detected intraoperative haemorrhage in 5.13% (239) of patients, all of them benefited from the intraoperative strategies based on iMRI findings.; Conclusions: Intraoperative visualisation of functional structures could be a feasible, safe and effective technique. Combined with intraoperative high-field MRI, it contributed to enhance the biopsy accuracy and lower neurological complications in stereotactic brain biopsy involving motor eloquent areas.

N2  -  In the decade since its debut, the Mesocircuit Hypothesis (MH) has provided researchers a scaffolding for interpreting their findings by associating subcortical-cortical dysfunction with the loss and recovery of consciousness following severe brain injury. Here, we leverage new findings from human and rodent lesions, as well as chemo/optogenetic, tractography, and stimulation studies to propose the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) as an additional node in the MH, in hopes of increasing its explanatory power. Specifically, we discuss the anatomical and molecular mechanisms involving the GPe in sleep-wake control and propose a plausible mechanistic model explaining how the GPe can modulate cortical activity through its direct connections with the prefrontal cortex and thalamic reticular nucleus to initiate and maintain sleep. The inclusion of the GPe in the arousal circuitry has implications for understanding a range of phenomena, such as the effects of the adenosine (A2A) and dopamine (D2) receptors on sleep-wake cycles, the paradoxical effects of zolpidem in disorders of consciousness, and sleep disturbances in conditions such as Parkinson's Disease.

N2  -  Objective: Resection of tumors involving the motor area frequently results in postoperative motor deficits. In an attempt to prevent poor motor outcomes, our institution has utilized pre-operative fMRI and tractography as well as intraoperative cortical mapping and continuous motor tasks during awake surgery in patients with motor area tumors. In one case, a patient demonstrated deterioration in continuous motor task performance before initiation of tumor resection. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between head position and development of intraoperative or postoperative motor deficits in five patients with motor area tumors. Clinical Presentation: In four cases, the patient's head was rotated 60 degrees from the supine position. In two cases, in which the tumor was located relatively medially, deterioration in continuous motor task function was noted prior to resection of the tumor. In the two other cases, in which the tumor was located relatively laterally, there was no deterioration of continuous motor task performance until resection of the tumor. Another patient, in whom the tumor was located relatively medially, underwent surgery with the head positioned straight and with the patient in a half-sitting position. This patient did not experience deterioration of continuous motor task performance during the surgery. Conclusion: These data suggest that head positioning can have a significant impact on motor function in patients with motor area tumors. Furthermore, the straight head position may be the preferred positioning, particularly for patients with tumors located on the medial side of motor area.

N2  -  Introduction: The insula is a highly connected area, as an intricate network of afferent and efferent projections connect it with adjacent and distant cortical regions.
Objective: To perform an extensive review of recent literature to analyse the anatomy of the associative tracts related to the insula.; Results.: The frontal aslant tract, arcuate fasciculus, horizontal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the middle longitudinal fasciculus are associative tracts connected to the opercula. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and uncinate fasciculus run under the anterior and inferior portion of the insula.; Conclusions: the pars triangularis and orbicularis of the inferior frontal gyms, as well as the middle and anterior part of the superior temporal gyms, have few connections with the perisylvian associative network. Consequently, in the trans-opercular approach to the insula, these 2 regions represent anatomical corridors that give access to the insula. The IFOF and the uncinate fasciculus represent the deep functional margin of resection. (C) 2014 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Knowledge of the plasticity of language pathways in patients with low-grade glioma is important for neurosurgeons to achieve maximum resection while preserving neurological function. The current study sought to investigate changes in the ventral language pathways in patients with low-grade glioma located in regions likely to affect the dorsal language pathways. The results revealed no significant difference in fractional anisotropy values in the arcuate fasciculus between groups or between hemispheres. However, fractional anisotropy and lateralization index values in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and lateralization index values in the left inferior fronto-occpital fasciculus were higher in patients than in healthy subjects. These results indicate plasticity of language pathways in patients with low-grade glioma. The ventral language pathways may perform more functions in patients than in healthy subjects. As such, it is important to protect the ventral language pathways intraoperatively.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Electrocortical stimulation mapping (ECS) is widely used to identify essential language areas, but sentence-level processing has rarely been investigated. METHODS While undergoing awake surgery in the dominant left hemisphere, 6 subjects were asked to comprehend sentences varying in their demands on syntactic processing. RESULTS In all 6 subjects, stimulation of the inferior frontal gyrus disrupted comprehension of passive sentences, which critically depend on syntactic processing to correctly assign grammatical roles, without disrupting comprehension of simpler tasks. In 4 of the 6 subjects, these sites were localized to the pars opercularis. Sentence comprehension was also disrupted by stimulation of other perisylvian sites, but in a more variable manner. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that there may be language regions that differentially contribute to sentence processing and which therefore are best identified using sentence-level tasks. The functional consequences of resecting these sites remain to be investigated.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been proposed as a potential alternative for ventral brainstem lesions. The surgical anatomy, feasibility, and limitations of the EEA for intrinsic brainstem lesions are still poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical planning, anatomy, and technique of an intrinsic pontine glioma operated via EEA.; METHODS: Six-human brainstems were prepared for white matter microdissection. Ten healthy subjects were studied with high-definition fiber tractography (HDFT). A 56-yr-old female with right-hemiparesis underwent EEA for an exophytic pontine glioma. Pre- and postoperative HDFTs were implemented.; RESULTS: The corticospinal tracts (CSTs) are the most eloquent fibers in the ventral brainstem. At the pons, CSTs run between the pontine nuclei and the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP). At the lower medulla, the pyramidal decussation leaves no room for safe ventral access. In our illustrative case, preoperative HDFT showed left-CST displaced posteromedially and partially disrupted, right-CST posteriorly displaced, and MCP severely disrupted. A transclival exposure was performed achieving a complete resection of the exophytic component with residual intra-axial tumor. Immediately postop, patient developed new left-side abducens nerve palsy and worse right-hemiparesis. Ten days postop, her strength returned to baseline. HDFT showed preservation and trajectory restoration of the CSTs.; CONCLUSION: The EEA provides direct access to the ventral brainstem, overcoming the limitations of lateral approaches. For intrinsic pathology, HDFT helps choosing the most appropriate surgical routeboundaries for safer resection. Further experience is needed to determine the indications and limitations of this approach that should be performed by neurosurgeons with high-level expertise in EEA.

N2  -  Background: Trigonal meningiomas have unique clinical presentation, unlike those in other areas of brain. Situated deep in the brain, the surgical nuances of this tumour are distinctive. We present our experience with this tumour including a discussion of surgical corridors that may be employed.
Methods: At our centre, 12 trigonal meningiomas were operated over past two decades. A retrospective analysis of case records of these cases was undertaken as regards age, sex clinical presentation, imaging and surgical approach.; Results: Mean time from heralding symptom to presentation was 10.4 months. At presentation, the most commonly encountered symptoms were those of non-localising symptoms attributable to raised ICP. Majority of lesions were more than 6 cm and on left side and the preferred surgical approach was inferior temporo-parietal. Most symptoms were relieved on long-term follow-up except homonymous hemianopia.; Conclusion: The incidence of deficit is low on employing the "shortest route'' approach, even in the dominant hemisphere and through eloquent area. This may be secondary to possible shift of eloquent area function due to longstanding lesion and may thus be a "workable'' surgical option, especially in resource-limited centres where such resources as neuronavigation and tractography may be unavailable.

N2  -  Dysgeusia, or distorted taste, has recently been acknowledged as a complication of thalamic ablation or thalamic deep brain stimulation as a treatment of tremor. In a unique patient, left-sided MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy improved right-sided essential tremor but also induced severe dysgeusia. Although dysgeusia persisted and caused substantial weight loss, tremor slowly relapsed. Therefore, 19 months after the first procedure, the patient underwent a second focused ultrasound thalamotomy procedure, which again improved tremor but also completely resolved the dysgeusia. On the basis of normative and patient-specific whole-brain tractography, the authors determined the relationship between the thalamotomy lesions and the medial border of the medial lemniscus-a surrogate for the solitariothalamic gustatory fibers-after the first and second focused ultrasound thalamotomy procedures. Both tractography methods suggested partial and complete disruption of the solitariothalamic gustatory fibers after the first and second thalamotomy procedures, respectively. The tractography findings in this unique patient demonstrate that incomplete and complete disruption of a neural pathway can induce and resolve symptoms, respectively, and serve as the rationale for ablative procedures for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

N2  -  Object. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is used as a hemostatic agent in many neurosurgery centers. The authors used a 3% H(2)O(2) solution for final hemostasis after removal of a left insular tumor. Immediately afterward, air bubbles were observed within the lumen of the polar temporal artery. Postoperative MR imaging revealed punctate areas of infarction in the lenticulostriate artery territory. The authors designed an experimental Study to elucidate the mechanism of remote O(2) emboli and reactive O(2) species-related vasoactive responses and thrombus formation.
Methods. In this study, H(2)O(2) irrigation was used in mice with either an intact pial layer or after the pia mater was removed through a corticotomy. Normal saline irrigation was used in the corresponding control groups. Vessels were examined for intravascular O(2) emboli under the microscope. Tissue sections were then obtained and stained with H & E and the 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) antibody to evaluate intravascular thrombus formation and peroxynitrite reaction, respectively.; Results. Multiple bubbles were observed within the lumen of the vessels after exposure to H(2)O(2) regardless of whether the pial layer was destroyed or intact. Immunofluorescent staining for 3-NT showed an abundant positive reaction in the vessel walls of all animals exposed to H(2)O(2) as well as vascular occlusion with acute thrombus formation. Samples taken from the animals that received saline showed no positive staining for 3-NT and no vascular occlusion.; Conclusions. Exposure to H(2)O(2) may cause serious ischemic complications. The formation of peroxynitrite may cause vasoactive responses to H(2)O(2) and platelet aggregationthrombus formation, and the free diffusion of H(2)O(2) through the vessel walls and its conversion to water and O(2) leads to O(2) bubbles within the closed vessel lumen. If used intradurally, H(2)O(2) may have deleterious ischemic effects, and it can only be used carefully in open extradural spaces. (DOI: 10.31712008.3.17434)

N2  -  Two-dimensional (2-D) biomedical semantic segmentation is important for robotic vision in surgery. Segmentation methods based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can out-perform conventional methods in terms of both accuracy and levels of automation. One common issue in training a DCNN for biomedical semantic segmentation is the internal covariate shift where the training of convolutional kernels is encumbered by the distribution change of input features, hence both the training speed and performance are decreased. Batch normalization (BN) is the first proposed method for addressing internal covariate shift and is widely used. Instance normalization (IN) and layer normalization (LN) have also been proposed. Group normalization (GN) is proposed more recently and has not yet been applied to 2-D biomedical semantic segmentation (GN was used in 3-D biomedical semantic segmentation in [P.-Y. Kao, T. Ngo, A. Zhang, J. Chen, and B. Manjunath, Brain tumor segmentation and tractographic feature extraction from structural MR images for overall survival prediction 2018, arXiv:1807.07716], however, no specific validations on GN were given). Most DCNNs for biomedical semantic segmentation adopt BN as the normalization method by default, without reviewing its performance. In this letter, four normalization methods-BN, IN, LN, and GN are compared in details, specifically for 2-D biomedical semantic segmentation. U-Net is adopted as the basic DCNN structure. Three datasets regarding the right ventricle, aorta, and left ventricle are used for the validation. The results show that detailed subdivision of the feature map, i.e., GN with a large group number or IN, achieves higher accuracy. This accuracy improvement mainly comes from better model generalization. Codes are uploaded and maintained at Xiao-Yun Zhou's Github.

N2  -  During the past decades, medical applications of virtual reality technology have been developing rapidly, ranging from a research curiosity to a commercially and clinically important area of medical informatics and technology. With the aid of new technologies, the user is able to process large amounts of data sets to create accurate and almost realistic reconstructions of anatomic structures and related pathologies. As a result, a 3-diensional (3-D) representation is obtained, and surgeons can explore the brain for planning or training. Further improvement such as a feedback system increases the interaction between users and models by creating a virtual environment. Its use for advanced 3-D planning in neurosurgery is described. Different systems of medical image volume rendering have been used and analyzed for advanced 3-D planning: 1 is a commercial "ready-to-go" system (Dextroscope, Bracco, Volume Interaction, Singapore), whereas the others are open-source-based software (3-D Slicer, FSL, and FreesSurfer). Different neurosurgeons at our institution experienced how advanced 3-D planning before surgery allowed them to facilitate and increase their understanding of the complex anatomic and pathological relationships of the lesion. They all agreed that the preoperative experience of virtually planning the approach was helpful during the operative procedure. Virtual reality for advanced 3-D planning in neurosurgery has achieved considerable realism as a result of the available processing power of modern computers. Although it has been found useful to facilitate the understanding of complex anatomic relationships, further effort is needed to increase the quality of the interaction between the user and the model.

N2  -  Study design: This is a clinical trial (phase 1).
Objectives: The objective of this study was to asses the safety and feasibility of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and Schwann cell (SC) co-injection through cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for the treatment of patients with chronic spinal cord injury.; Methods: Six subjects with complete spinal cord injury due to trauma according to International Standard of Neurological Classification for Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) developed by the American Spinal Injury Association were enrolled. They received autologous co-transplantation of MSC and SC through lumbar puncture. Neurological status of the patients was determined by ISNCSCI, as well as by assessment of functional status by Spinal Cord Independent Measure. Before and after cell transplantation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for all the patients. Before the procedure, all the patients underwent electromyography, urodynamic study (UDS) and MRI tractograghy. After transplantation, these assessments were performed in special cases when the patients reported any changes in motor function or any changes in urinary sensation.; Results: Over the mean 30 months of follow-up, the radiological findings were unchanged without any evidence of neoplastic tissue overgrowth. American Spinal Injury Association class in one patient was changed from A to B, in addition to the improvement in indexes of UDS, especially bladder compliance, which was congruous with axonal regeneration detected in MRI tractography. No motor score improvement was observed among the patients.; Conclusion: No adverse findings were detected at a mean of 30 months after autologous transplantation of the combination of MSCs and SCs through CSF. It may suggest the safety of this combination of cells for spinal cord regeneration.

N2  -  Background: Tracking the white matter principal tracts is routinely typically included during the pre-surgery planning examinations and has revealed to limit functional resection of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) in eloquent areas.
Objective: We examined the integrity of the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF) and Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus (IFOF), both known to be part of the language-related network in patients with LGGs involving the temporo-insular cortex. In a comparative approach, we contrasted the main quantitative fiber tracking values in the tumoral (T) and healthy (H) hemispheres to test whether or not this ratio could discriminate amongst patients with different post-operative outcomes.; Methods: Twenty-six patients with LGGs were included. We obtained quantitative fiber tracking values in the tumoral and healthy hemispheres and calculated the ratio (H-IFOF-T-IFOF)H-IFOF and the ratio (H-SLF-T-SLF)H-SLF on the number of streamlines. We analyzed how these values varied between patients with and without post-operative neurological outcomes and between patients with different post-operative Engel classes.; Results: The ratio for both IFOF and SLF significantly differed between patient with and without post-operative neurological language deficits. No associations were found between white matter structural changes and post-operative seizure outcomes.; Conclusions: Calculating the ratio on the number of streamlines and fractional anisotropy between the tumoral and the healthy hemispheres resulted to be a useful approach, which can prove to be useful during the pre-operative planning examination, as it gives a glimpse on the potential clinical outcomes in patients with LGGs involving the left temporo-insular cortex.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical management of cerebellar lesions remains challenging. Thus, it is important to have sound knowledge of the microsurgical anatomy of the cerebellum and dentate nucleus (DN) and to define different types of exposure in a variety of surgical interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the anatomy of the DN from a neurosurgical viewpoint using fiber tracking techniques.; METHODS: Ten formalin-fixed human hemispheres were dissected with the Ludwig and Klingler fiber dissection technique under 6 to 40 magnification. Anatomic images were created with 3-dimensional diffusion tensor imaging. The relationships of the DN to tentorium and suboccipital and lateral surfaces of the cerebellum and its spatial positioning relative to different surgical approaches in the cerebellum and fourth ventricle were examined. The fiber tracts terminating at and surrounding the DN were defined.; RESULTS: The DN is at greater risk of being injured in the transvermian and supratonsillar approaches to the cerebellum and fourth ventricle, with lesser risk in the telovelar and subtonsillar approaches. Superior approaches are safer compared with other approaches.; CONCLUSION: The DN represents an important anatomic structure in surgical interventions involving the posterior fossa, particularly in the elderly because of the common occurrence of atrophy-related problems in this age group. Functionally and anatomically, the DN is closely related to the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles. The inferior cerebellar peduncle poses positional risks because it follows an anterior and superior course relative to the DN. The telovelar approach is a safer procedure for interventions involving the pathological lesions of the fourth ventricle floor.

N2  -  PurposeDirect subcortical motor mapping is the golden criterion to detect and monitor the motor pathway during glioma surgery. Minimal subcortical monopolar threshold (MSCMT) means the minimal distance away from the motor pathway and is critical to decide to continue or interrupt glioma resection. However, the optimal cutoff value of MSCMT for glioma resection in non-awake patients has not been reported discreetly. In this study, we try to establish the safe cutoff value of MSCMT for glioma resection and analyzed its relationship with postoperative motor deficit and long-term survivals. MethodsWe designed this prospective study with high-frequency electronic stimulus method. The cutoff MSCMT of postoperative motor deficits was statistically calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and its relationship with motor deficit and survivals was analyzed by logistic and Cox regression, respectively. ResultsThe cutoff MSCMT to predict motor deficit after surgery was 3.9 mA on day 1, 3.7 mA on day 7, 5.2 mA at 3 months, and 5.2 mA at 6 months. MSCMT <= 3.9 mA and MSCMT <= 5.2 mA independently predicted postoperative motor deficits at four times after surgery (P < 0.05) but had no effect on the removal degree of tumor (P > 0.05). In high-grade gliomas, MSCMT <= 3.9 mA independently predicted shorter progression-free survival [odds ratio (OR) = 3.381 (1.416-8.076), P = 0.006] and overall survival [OR = 3.651 (1.336-9.977), P = 0.012]. Power model has the best fitness for paired monopolar and bipolar high-frequency thresholds. ConclusionsThis study showed strong cause-effect relation between MSCMT and postoperative motor deficit and prognoses. The cutoff MSCMT was dug out to avoid postoperative motor deficit. Further studies are needed to establish the results above.

N2  -  The authors report on an observational study designed to isolate the impact of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) on surgical outcome in glioblastoma treatment. We undertook a controlled observational study to identify the additive impact of presurgical nTMS in patients scheduled for surgical treatment of glioblastoma in or near motor eloquent locations. The trial data is derived from a large university hospital with a differential availability of its nTMS mapping service at its two campuses, both equally served by a single neurosurgical department. When available, the nTMS cortical mapping data and nTMS-based fiber tractography are used for surgical planning and patient counseling as well as intraoperative identification of the primary motor cortex and guidance in subcortical motor mapping. The addition of preoperative nTMS mapping data to a clinical routine already incorporating preoperative fiber tractography and intraoperative neuronavigation and electrophysiology was shown to improve surgical outcomes by increasing the extent of resection, without compromising patient safety or long-term functional outcomes in comparison to the concurrent non-TMS control group. This study is the first to prove that the improved surgical outcomes observed in previous studies after the implementation of nTMS to presurgical work-up are not caused by any overall improvement in patient care or a paradigm shift toward more aggressive resection but by the additional functional data provided by nTMS.

N2  -  Advanced imaging techniques (tractography) enable the mapping of white matter (WM) pathways and the understanding of brain connectivity patterns. We combined tractography with a network-based approach to examine WM microstructure on a network level in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (pw-RRMS) and healthy controls (HCs) over 2 years. Seventy-six pw-RRMS matched with 43 HCs underwent clinical assessments and 3T MRI scans at baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (2-YFU). Probabilistic tractography was performed, accounting for the effect of lesions, producing connectomes of 25 million streamlines. Network differences in fibre density across pw-RRMS and HCs at BL and 2-YFU were quantified using network-based statistics (NBS). Longitudinal network differences in fibre density were quantified using NBS in pw-RRMS, and were tested for correlations with disability, cognition and fatigue scores. Widespread network reductions in fibre density were found in pw-RRMS compared with HCs at BL in cortical regions, with more reductions detected at 2-YFU. Pw-RRMS had reduced fibre density at BL in the thalamocortical network compared to 2-YFU. This effect appeared after correction for age, was robust across different thresholds, and did not correlate with lesion volume or disease duration. Pw-RRMS demonstrated a robust and long-distance improvement in the thalamocortical WM network, regardless of age, disease burden, duration or therapy, suggesting a potential locus of neuroplasticity in MS. This network's role over the disease's lifespan and its potential implications in prognosis and treatment warrants further investigation.
Using longitudinal combined tractography with a network-based approach, our findings highlight a robust and long-distance improvement in the thalamocortical white matter network, suggesting a potential locus of neuroplasticity in clinically stable treated people with MS. image

N2  -  Most of us can use our "mind's eye" to mentally visualize things that are not in our direct line of sight, an ability known as visual mental imagery. Extensive left temporal damage can impair patients' visual mental imagery experience, but the critical locus of lesion is unknown. Our recent meta-analysis of 27 fMRI studies of visual mental imagery highlighted a well-delimited region in the left lateral midfusiform gyrus, which was consistently activated during visual mental imagery, and which we called the Fusiform Imagery Node (FIN). Here, we describe the connectional anatomy of FIN in neurotypical participants and in RDS, a right-handed patient with an extensive occipito-temporal stroke in the left hemisphere. The stroke provoked right homonymous hemianopia, alexia without agraphia, and color anomia. Despite these deficits, RDS had normal subjective experience of visual mental imagery and reasonably preserved behavioral performance on tests of visual mental imagery of object shape, object color, letters, faces, and spatial relationships. We found that the FIN was spared by the lesion. We then assessed the connectional anatomy of the FIN in the MNI space and in the patient's native space, by visualizing the fibers of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) passing through the FIN. In both spaces, the ILF connected the FIN with the anterior temporal lobe, and the AF linked it with frontal regions. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the FIN is a node of a brain network dedicated to voluntary visual mental imagery. The FIN could act as a bridge between visual information and semantic knowledge processed in the anterior temporal lobe and in the language circuits.

N2  -  Brainstem surgery is more difficult and riskier than surgeries in other parts of the brain due to the high density of critical tracts and cranial nerves nuclei in this region. For this reason, some safe entry zones into the brainstem have been described. The main purpose of this article is to bring on the agenda the significance of the intrinsic structures of the safe entry zones to the brainstem. Having detailed information about anatomic localization of these sensitive structures is important to predict and avoid possible surgical complications. In order to better understand this complex anatomy, we schematically drew the axial sections of the brainstem showing the intrinsic structures at the level of 9 safe entry zones that we used, taking into account basic neuroanatomy books and atlases. Some illustrations are also supported with intraoperative pictures to provide better surgical orientation. The second purpose is to remind surgeons of clinical syndromes that may occur in case of surgical injury to these delicate structures. Advanced techniques such as tractography, neuronavigation, and neuromonitorization should be used in brainstem surgery, but detailed neuroanatomic knowledge about safe entry zones and a meticulous surgery are more important. The axial brainstem sections we have drawn can help young neurosurgeons better understand this complex anatomy.

N2  -  We report our initial experience to optimize neurosurgical procedures using high field strength intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (IOMRI) in 300 consecutive patients as high field strength IOMRI rapidly becomes the standard of care for neurosurgical procedures. Three sequential groups (groups A, B, C; n = 100 each) were compared with respect to time management, complications and technical difficulties to assess improvement in these parameters with experience. We observed a reduction in the number of technical difficulties (p < 0.001), time to induction (p < 0.001) and total anesthesia time (p = 0.007) in sequential groups. IOMRI was performed for neuronavigation guidance (n = 252) and intraoperative validation of extent of resection (EOR; n = 67). Performing IOMRI increased the EOR over and beyond the primary surgical attempt in 20.5% (29/141) and 18% (11/61) of patients undergoing glioma and pituitary surgery, respectively. Overall, EOR improved in 59.7% of patients undergoing IOMRI (40/67). Intraoperative tractography and real time navigation using re-uploaded IOMRI images (accounting for brain shift) helps in intraoperative planning to reduce complications. IOMRI is an asset to neurosurgeons, helping to augment the EOR, especially in glioma and pituitary surgery, with no significant increase in morbidity to the patient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Strong right-hand preference on the population level is a uniquely human feature, although its neural basis is still not clearly defined. Recent behavioural and neuroimaging literature suggests that hand preference may be related to the orchestrated function and size of fronto-parietal white matter tracts bilaterally. Lesions to these tracts induced during tumour resection may provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In the present study, a cohort of seventeen neurosurgical patients with left hemisphere brain tumours were recruited to investigate whether resection of certain white matter tracts affects the choice of hand selected for the execution of a goal -directed task (assembly of jigsaw puzzles). Patients performed the puzzles, but also tests for basic motor ability, selective attention and visuo-constructional ability, preoperatively and one month after surgery. An atlas - based disconnectome analysis was conducted to evaluate whether resection of tracts was significantly associated with changes in hand selection. Diffusion tractography was also used to dissect fronto-parietal tracts (the superior longitudinal fasciculus) and the corticospinal tract. Results showed a shift in hand selection despite the absence of any motor or cognitive deficits, which was significantly associated with frontal and parietal resections rather than other lobes. In particular, the shift in hand selection was signifi- cantly associated with the resection of dorsal rather than ventral fronto-parietal white matter connections. Dorsal white matter pathways contribute bilaterally to control of goal - directed hand movements. We show that unilateral lesions, that may unbalance the cooperation of the two hemispheres, can alter the choice of hand selected to accomplish movements. (c) 2020 The Authors.

The extent to which demographic and health factors predict language impairment beyond traditional cortical measures remains unknown. Identifying and understanding the contributions of factors to predictive models of severity constitutes critical knowledge for clinicians interested in charting the likely course of aphasia in their patients and designing effective treatment approaches in light of those predictions.
Methods: Utilizing neuroimaging and language testing from our cohort of 224 individuals in the chronic stage of recovery from a left-hemisphere stroke in a cross-sectional study, we first conducted a lesion symptom mapping (LSM) analysis to identify regions associated with aphasia severity scores. After controlling for lesion volume and damage to preidentified areas, three models were created to predict severity scores: 1) Demographic Model (N = 147); 2) Health Model (N = 106); and 3) Overall Model (N = 106). Finally, all identified factors were entered into a Final Model to predict raw severity scores.; Results: Two areas were associated with aphasia severity-left posterior insula and left arcuate fasciculus. The results from the Demographic Model revealed non-linguistic cognitive ability, age at stroke, and time post-stroke as significant predictors of severity (P = .005; P = .02; P = .001, respectively), and results from the Health Model suggested the extent of leukoaraiosis is associated with severity (P = .0004). The Overall Model showed a relationship between aphasia severity and cognitive ability (P = .01), time post-stroke (P = .002), and leukoaraiosis (P = .01). In the Final Model, which aimed to predict raw severity scores, demographic, health, and lesion factors explained 55% of the variance in severity, with health and demographic factors uniquely explaining nearly half of performance variance.; Conclusions: Results from this study add to the literature suggesting patient-specific variables can shed light on individual differences in severity beyond lesion factors. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of non-linguistic cognitive ability and brain health in aphasia recovery. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Focal white matter lesions can cause cognitive impairments due to disconnections within or between networks. There is some preliminary evidence that there are specific hubs and fiber pathways that should be spared during surgery to retain cognitive performance. A tract potentially involved in important higher-level cognitive processes is the frontal aslant tract. It roughly connects the posterior parts of the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. Functionally, the left frontal aslant tract has been associated with speech and the right tract with executive functions. However, there currently is insufficient knowledge about the right frontal aslant tract's exact functional importance. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the right frontal aslant tract in executive functions via a lesion-symptom approach. We retrospectively examined 72 patients with frontal glial tumors and correlated measures from tractography (distance between tract and tumor, and structural integrity of the tract) with cognitive test performances. The results indicated involvement of the right frontal aslant tract in shifting attention and letter fluency. This involvement was not found for the left tract. Although this study was exploratory, these converging findings contribute to a better understanding of the functional frontal subcortical anatomy. Shifting attention and letter fluency are important for healthy cognitive functioning, and when impaired they may greatly influence a patient's wellbeing. Further research is needed to assess whether or not damage to the right frontal aslant tract causes permanent cognitive impairments, and consequently identifies this tract as a critical pathway that should be taken into account during neurosurgical procedures.

N2  -  Although the three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has spread in the field of neurosurgery, the use of 3D print models concerning glioma surgery has rarely reported. For glioma surgery, some preoperative and intraoperative assistive methods have been developed to avoid injury to the cortex and fiber that are related to the neurological function. Furthermore, in order to perform preoperative simulation of glioma surgery, we created a 3D print model using a multi-material 3D printer that provided the flexibility of adjusting the color, hardness, and translucency of each structure arbitrarily. The use of 3D print model was demonstrated in one case involving an intramedullary tumor in the right temporal lobe. The tumor, optic radiation, brain parenchyma, tentorium, ventricle, and sinus were constructed in a single model in one printing process. Design of the degree of resection, insertion of the fence-post, and tumor resection paying attention to the optic radiation were simulated preoperatively using this model. The surgery was performed generally as the simulation and gross total removal of the tumor was achieved. This model was useful for understanding the degree of resection, adequate insertion of the fence-post, and the rela-tionship of the tumor with other important structures. A variety of printing materials contributed to make the model realistic and to understand anatomical relationship. In conclusion, the 3D print model can supplement an image of some portions that are not visible perioperatively and serve as a preopera-tive assistant modality. (c) 2021 The Authors.

N2  -  Background: Understanding of cortico-cortical activity in eloquent areas intraoperatively is crucial for neurosurgical procedures. Here, we used intraoperative near-infrared spectroscopy (iNIRS) during direct cortical stimulation as a robust tool to better understand the cortico-cortical connectivity in language systems.
Methods: We applied iNIRS to 3 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery due to lesions (cavernous angioma, epidermoid cyst, and low-grade glioma) located in language areas. Using iNIRS, we measured the blood concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) in the lateral temporal cortex during direct cortical stimulation (50 Hz) at the inferior frontal area where Broca's area was probabilistically located.; Results: In all patients, 50 Hz stimulation elicited hemodynamic changes in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). During 0.8-4.8 s after stimulation, HbO2 increased and HbR decreased in the posterior part of the STG (Wernicke's area). Similar responses were observed in the anterior part of the STG 1.3-8.0 s after stimulation. Finally, these changes were disappeared in the middle temporal gyrus.; Conclusions: Our results suggest that cortical stimulation of Broca's area elicits hemodynamic responses in Wernicke's area via cortico-cortical connectivity. We demonstrated cortico-cortical evoked responses in language systems using iNIRS during direct cortical stimulation. Our iNIRS data will provide useful information about cortico-cortical networks underlying human brain functions intraoperatively and will contribute to neurosurgical treatment in eloquent areas.

N2  -  Objective. - The right "non-dominant" temporo-parietal junction is usually not considered as a highly eloquent area. This contrasts with its mirrored left "dominant" counterpart, which is known as highly eloquent regarding language function. The question arises about which functions should be monitored when operating lesions of the right temporo-parietal junction under awake conditions.
Methods. - We report the case of a patient who underwent a surgical resection of a glioma located in the right temporo-parietal junction. Cognitive evaluations were performed preoperatively and 4 months after surgery, as well as resting state fMRI and diffusion -based tractography.; Results. - Long-term postoperative cognitive examination revealed an important deterioration of cognitive control abilities, especially regarding set-shifting abilities as measured by Trail making test part B. Based on pre- and postoperative resting state fMRI and diffusion -based tractography, we demonstrate that surgical resection massively impacted structural and functional connectivity of the right fronto-parieto-temporal network, a network that is classically involved in cognitive control, reasoning and working memory.; Conclusion. - This case clearly illustrates how a white matter focal lesion can generate a neuropsychological deficit by remotely disconnecting distant cortical areas belonging to a functional network. Furthermore, our observation strongly supports the use of intraoperative cognitive control tests during surgery of the right temporo-parietal junction and promote the interest of pre- and postoperative resting state functional connectivity to explore the potential mechanisms causing cognitive deficits.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Preoperative visualization of the facial nerve could help neurosurgeons to prevent facial nerve injury during vestibular schwannoma surgery. Some studies have addressed diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for preoperative identification of the facial nerve. However, few studies have focused on tractography-integrated neuronavigation for DTT verification. This study aimed to explore the appropriate DTT tracing parameters and evaluate the effect of intraoperative facial nerve tractography-integrated neuronavigation for verifying the DTT accuracy.
METHODS: Patients who underwent vestibular schwannoma surgery between September 2013 and August 2015 were included. Clinical features were recorded. All patients underwent preoperative DTT with 2 seed regions of interest and a variable fractional anisotropy threshold. Intraoperatively, the facial fiber tract guided by the neuronavigation was compared with the real location of facial nerve so that the accuracy of DTT was verified. Postoperative facial nerve function of each patients was followed up.; RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled in this study. Successful facial fiber tracts was obtained in 18 patients. In 17 of the 18 patients, intraoperative navigation confirmed DTT accuracy. The facial nerves were located on the anterior middle third of the tumor in 9 patients. Twelve months after surgery, facial nerve function was classified as grade I in 10 patients and grade II in 8 patients.; CONCLUSIONS: We consider preoperative DTT with intraoperative tractography-integrated neuronavigation to be a useful method for identifying the location of the facial nerve. This method might improve facial nerve preservation.

N2  -  Purpose Minimizing post-operational neurological deficits as a result of brain surgery has been one of the most pertinent endeavours of neurosurgical research. Studies have utilised fMRIs, EEGs and MEGs in order to delineate and establish eloquent areas, however, these methods have not been utilized by the wider neurosurgical community due to a lack of clinical endpoints. We sought to ascertain if there is a correlation between graph theory metrics and the neurosurgical notion of eloquent brain regions. We also wanted to establish which graph theory based nodal centrality measure performs the best in predicting eloquent areas. Methods We obtained diffusion neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and applied a parcellation scheme to it. This enabled us to construct a weighted adjacency matrix which we then analysed. Our analysis looked at the correlation between PageRank centrality and eloquent areas. We then compared PageRank centrality to eigenvector centrality and degree centrality to see what the best measure of empirical neurosurgical eloquence was. Results Areas that are considered neurosurgically eloquent tended to be predicted by high PageRank centrality. By using summary scores for the three nodal centrality measures we found that PageRank centrality best correlated to empirical neurosurgical eloquence. Conclusion The notion of eloquent areas is important to neurosurgery and graph theory provides a mathematical framework to predict these areas. PageRank centrality is able to consistently find areas that we consider eloquent. It is able to do so better than eigenvector and degree central measures.

N2  -  OBJECT Surgery of brainstem lesions is increasingly performed despite the fact that surgical indications and techniques continue to be debated. The deep pons, in particular, continues to be a critical area in which the specific risks related to different surgical strategies continue to be examined. With the intention of bringing new knowledge into this important arena, the authors systematically examined the results of brainstem surgeries that have been performed through the lateral infratrigeminal transpontine window.
METHODS Between 1990 and 2013, 29 consecutive patients underwent surgery through this window for either biopsy sampling or for removal of a deep pontine lesion. All of this work was performed at the Department of Neurosurgery of the Istituto Nazionale Neurologico "Carlo Besta", in Milan, Italy. A retrospective analysis of the findings was conducted with the intention of bringing further clarity to this important surgical strategy.; RESULTS The lateral infratrigeminal transpontine window was exposed through 4 different approaches: 1) classic retrosigmoid (15 cases), 2) minimally invasive keyhole retrosigmoid (10 cases), 3) translabyrinthine (1 case), and 4) combined petrosal (3 cases). No deaths occurred during the entire clinical study. The surgical complications that were observed included hydrocephalus (2 cases) and CSF leakage (1 case). In 6(20.7%) of 29 patients the authors encountered new neurological deficits during the immediate postoperative period. All 6 of these patients had undergone lesion removal. In only 2 of these 6 patients were permanent sequelae observed at 3 months follow-up. These findings show that 93% of the patients studied did not report any permanent worsening of their neurological condition after this surgical intervention.; CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study supports the idea that the lateral infratrigeminal transpontine window is both a low-risk and safe corridor for either biopsy sampling or for removal of deep pontine lesions.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microsurgical anatomy of the fiber tract connections of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA, and examine its potential functional role with reference to clinical trials in the literature.
METHODS: Ten postmortem formalin-fixed human brains (20 sides) and 1 cadaveric head were prepared following Klingler's method. The fiber dissection was performed in a stepwise fashion, from lateral to medial and also from medial to lateral, under an operating microscope, with 3D images captured at each stage. Our findings were supported by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging tractography in 2 healthy subjects.; RESULTS: The connections of the SMA complex, composed of the pre-SMA and the SMA proper, are composed of short "U" association fibers and the superior longitudinal fasciculus I, cingulum, claustrocortical fibers, callosal fibers, corticospinal tract, frontal aslant tract, and frontostriatal tract. The claustrocortical fibers may play an important role in the integration of motor, language, and limbic functions of the SMA complex. The frontostriatal tract connects the pre-SMA to the putamen and caudate nucleus, and also forms parts of both the internal capsule and the dorsal external capsule.; CONCLUSIONS: The SMA complex has numerous connections throughout the cerebrum. An understanding of these connections is important for presurgical planning for lesions in the frontal lobe and helps explain symptoms related to SMA injury.

N2  -  In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the study of white matter anatomy, both with the use of postmortem dissections and diffusion tensor imaging tractography. One of the precursors in the study of white matter anatomy was Raymond de Vieussens (1641-1716), a French anatomist born in Le Vigan. He studied medicine at the University of Montpellier in southern France, one of the most ancient and lively schools of medicine in Europe. In 1684 Vieussens published his masterpiece, the Neurographia Universalis, which is still considered one of the most complete and accurate descriptions of the nervous system provided in the 17th century. He described the white matter of the centrum ovate and was the first to demonstrate the continuity of the white matter fibers from the centrum ovale to the brainstem. He also described the dentate nuclei, the pyramids, and the olivary nuclei. According to the theory of Galen, Vieussens considered that the function of the white matter was to convey the "animal spirit" from the centrum ovale to the spinal cord. Although neglected, Vieussens' contribution to the study of white matter is relevant. His pioneering work showed that the white matter is not a homogeneous substance, but rather a complex structure rich in fibers that are interconnected with different parts of the brain. These initial results paved the way to advancements observed in later centuries that eventually led to modern hodology. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2012.8.JNS12387)

T2  -  FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY

N2  -  ObjectivePrevious studies have implicated intricate interactions between innate immunity and the brain in schizophrenia. Monocytic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling, a crucial "sensor" of innate immunity, was reported to be over-activated in link with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. As TLR4 is predominantly expressed on gliocytes prior to expression in neurons, we hypothesized that higher TLR4 levels may contribute to cognitive deterioration by affecting white matter microstructure. MethodsForty-four patients with stable chronic schizophrenia (SCS) and 59 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. The monocytic function was detected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to simulate bacterial infection. Basal and LPS- stimulated levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and interleukin (IL)-1 beta were quantified with flow cytometry. Cognitive function was assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We employed diffusion tensor imaging with a 3-T scanner and evaluated white-matter integrity with fractional anisotropy (FA). Subcortical volume and cortical thickness were also assessed. ResultsThe TLR4/NF-kappa B/IL-1 beta signaling pathway was activated in patients with SCS, but responded sluggishly to LPS stimulation when compared with HCs. Furthermore, monocytic TLR4 expressions were inversely correlated with cognitive function and white matter FA, but not with cortical thickness or subcortical gray matter volume in schizophrenia. ConclusionOur findings support altered TLR4 signaling pathway activity in association with deficits in cognition and white matter integrity in schizophrenia.

N2  -  Advances in fluorescent calcium indicating dyes over the past decade have identified calcium signaling as the tool by which astrocytes communicate among themselves and with neighboring neurons. Studies of astrocyte-neuron interactions have shown that calcium signaling is a potent modulator of the strength of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The concept that astrocytes possess a mechanism for rapid cell communication has not been incorporated, however, into the supportive functions of astrocytes. Because many of the classical tasks of astrocytes are linked to the blood-brain barrier, we have here examined the expression of proteins required for calcium signaling in their vascular end-foot processes. The gap junction protein, Cx43, was expressed intensively around the vessels interconnecting astrocytic end-foot processes. These gap junctions permitted diffusion of Lucifer yellow, specifically along the path of glial end feet apposed to the vessel wall. The purinergic receptors, P2Y(2) and P2Y(4), were also strongly expressed at the gliovascular interface and colocalized with GFAP around larger vessels in cortex. Multiphoton imaging of freshly prepared brain slices loaded with Fluo-4/AM revealed that ATP mobilized cytosolic calcium in astrocytic end feet, whereas electrical stimulation triggered calcium waves propagating along the vessel wall. Brain endothelial cells and pericytes were physically separated from astrocytes by the basal lamina and responded only weakly to ATP. These observations identify astrocytic end-foot processes plastered at the vessel wall as a center for purinergic signaling. It is speculated that calcium signaling may play a role in astrocytic functions related to the blood-brain barrier, including blood flow regulation, metabolic trafficking, and water homeostasis.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: actual challenge in surgical treatment of intra-axial gliomas involving eloquent areas is maximal safe resection. Mapping and monitoring of cortical and subcortical motor functions are important tools to avoid postoperative deficits. In the present study, we present our experience with a continuous dynamic motor mapping technique pairing a traditional monopolar stimulator with a Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) to perform a continuous stimulation of the white matter avoiding removal interruption;METHODS: we describe a single center retrospective analysis of 1-year consecutive patients with intraxial tumors located adjacent to corticospinal tract and treated with surgical resection adopting "continuous dynamic mapping technique". With the support of a reconstruction software (3D Slicer), we classified the Extent Of Resection (EOR) as Gross Total Resection (GTR) (>98%), Sub-Total Resection (STR) (from 90% to 97%), and Partial Resection (<90%). Medical Research Council (MRC) grading was adopted to evaluate neurological outcomes (from 0 to 5), assessed on 1st post-operative day, at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months;RESULTS: from July 2017 to July 2018, 29 patients underwent to surgical removal of intraxial tumor adjacent to motor areas, using continuous dynamic subcortical mapping. Median age was 54 years old (range 12-75 years). At pre-operative MRI tractography reconstruction, mean distance between tumor and corticospinal tract was 4,4 mm (range At 1 week post-operative assessment, motor deficits were still present in 12 patients (41%). At 1 month, 10 patients (35%) had persisting deficits, which required admission to rehabilitation department. At 3 months, 4 patients (14%) had persistent motor impairment and overall 28 patients (98%) were able to walk by themselves;CONCLUSIONS: our early experience showed that a combination of dynamic subcortical mapping with transcranial and cortical strip MEP (Motor Evoked Potentials) monitoring is useful in tumors close to motor eloquent areas to extend surgical resection avoiding permanent consequences. However, we need for further experience to consolidate and improve this technique.

N2  -  Objectives: A novel imaging technique (X-map) has been developed to identify acute ischemic lesions for stroke patients using non-contrast-enhanced dual-energy computed tomography (NE-DE-CT). Using the 3-material decomposition technique, the original X-map (X-map 1.0) eliminates fat and bone from the images, suppresses the gray matter (GM)-white matter (WM) tissue contrast, and makes signals of edema induced by severe ischemia easier to detect. The aim of this study was to address the following 2 problems with the X-map 1.0: (1) biases in CT numbers (or artifacts) near the skull of NE-DE-CT images and (2) large intrapatient and interpatient variations in X-map 1.0 values.
Materials and Methods: We improved both an iterative beam-hardening correction (iBHC) method and the X-map algorithm. The new iBHC (iBHC2) modeled x-ray physics more accurately. The new X-map (X-map 2.0) estimated regional GM valuesthus, maximizing the ability to suppress the GM-WM contrast, make edema signals quantitative, and enhance the edema signals that denote an increased water density for each pixel. We performed a retrospective study of 11 patients (3 men, 8 women; mean age, 76.3 years; range, 68-90 years) who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute stroke. Images were reconstructed with the old iBHC (iBHC1) and the iBHC2, and biases in CT numbers near the skull were measured. Both X-map 2.0 maps and X-map 1.0 maps were computed from iBHC2 images, both with and without a material decomposition-based edema signal enhancement (ESE) process. X-map values were measured at 5 to 9 locations on GM without infarct per patient; the mean value was calculated for each patient (we call it the patient-mean X-map value) and subtracted from the measured X-map values to generate zero-mean X-map values. The standard deviation of the patient-mean X-map values over multiple patients denotes the interpatient variation; the standard deviation over multiple zero-mean X-map values denotes the intrapatient variation. The Levene F test was performed to assess the difference in the standard deviations with different algorithms. Using 5 patient data who had diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) within 2 hours of NE-DE-CT, mean values at and near ischemic lesions were measured at 7 to 14 locations per patient with X-map images, CT images (low kV and high kV), and DWI images. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between a normalized increase in DWI signals and either X-map or CT.; Results: The bias in CT numbers was lower with iBHC2 than with iBHC1 in both high- and low-kV images (2.5 +- 2.0 HU 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-3.8 HU for iBHC2 vs 6.9 +- 2.3 HU 95% CI, 5.4-8.3 HU for iBHC1 with high-kV images, P < 0.01; 1.5 +- 3.6 HU 95% CI, -0.8 to 3.7 HU vs 12.8 +- 3.3 HU 95% CI, 10.7-14.8 HU with low-kV images, P < 0.01). The interpatient variation was smaller with X-map 2.0 than with X-map 1.0, both with and without ESE (4.3 95% CI, 3.0-7.6 for X-map 2.0 vs 19.0 95% CI, 13.3-22.4 for X-map 1.0, both with ESE, P < 0.01; 3.0 95% CI, 2.1-5.3 vs 12.0 95% CI, 8.4-21.0 without ESE, P < 0.01). The intrapatient variation was also smaller with X-map 2.0 than with X-map 1.0 (6.2 95% CI, 5.3-7.3 vs 8.5 95% CI, 7.3-10.1 with ESE, P = 0.0122; 4.1 95% CI, 3.6-4.9 vs 6.3 95% CI, 5.5-7.6 without ESE, P < 0.01). The best 3 correlation coefficients (R) with DWI signals were -0.733 (95% CI, -0.845 to -0.560, P < 0.001) for X-map 2.0 with ESE, -0.642 (95% CI, -0.787 to -0.429, P < 0.001) for high-kV CT, and -0.609 (95% CI, -0.766 to -0.384, P < 0.001) for X-map 1.0 with ESE.; Conclusion: Both of the 2 problems outlined in the objectives have been addressed by improving both iBHC and X-map algorithm. The iBHC2 improved the bias in CT numbers and the visibility of GM-WM contrast throughout the brain space. The combination of iBHC2 and X-map 2.0 with ESE decreased both intrapatient and interpatient variations of edema signals significantly and had a strong correlation with DWI signals in terms of the strength of edema signals.

N2  -  Introduction: Bilateral anterior capsulotomy (BAC) is an effective surgical procedure for patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRMD). In this work, we analyze the connectivity of the BAC lesions to identify connectivity "fingerprints" associated with clinical outcomes in patients with TRMD. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of ten patients following BAC surgery. These patients were divided into "responders" and "non-responders" based on the relative change in the Beck depression inventory (BDI) score after surgery. We generated the dorsolateral prefrontal associative (DLPFC) pathways and the ventromedial prefrontal limbic (vmPFC) pathways going through the anterior limb of the internal capsule and analyzed if the overlap of the BAC lesions with these pathways was associated with either outcome. Finally, we used the BAC lesions of our patients to generate group-averaged connectivity "fingerprints" associated with either outcome. Results: Six patients were responders (>= 50% improvement in BDI), four patients were non-responders (<50% improvement). No significant impairments were found in most neuropsychological tests after surgery. The overlap analysis showed that in the responder group, there was less involvement of the DLPFC pathways than the vmPFC pathways (p = 0.001). Conversely, in the non-responder group, there was no significant difference between the involvement of both pathways (p = 0.157). The responder and non-responder connectivity fingerprint showed significant connections with the vmPFC limbic areas. However, the non-responder connectivity fingerprint also showed stronger connectivity to associative areas including the DLPFC and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. Conclusions: The optimum outcome following BAC surgery in this cohort was associated with interruption of vmPFC pathways and the relative preservation of DLPFC pathways.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this anatomical study was to apply innovative imaging techniques to increase understanding of the microanatomical structures of the brainstem related to safe entry zones. The authors hypothesized that such a high-detail overview would enhance neurosurgeons' abilities to approach and define anatomical safe entry zones for use with microsurgical resection techniques for intrinsic brainstem lesions.METHODS The brainstems of 13 cadavers were studied with polarized light imaging (PLI) and 11.7-T MRI. The brain -stem was divided into 3 compartments-mesencephalon, pons, and medulla-for evaluation with MRI. Tissue was fur-ther sectioned to 100 mu m with a microtome. MATLAB was used for further data processing. Segmentation of the internal structures of the brainstem was performed with the BigBrain database.RESULTS Thirteen entry zones were reported and assessed for their safety, including the anterior mesencephalic zone, lateral mesencephalic sulcus, interpeduncular zone, intercollicular region, supratrigeminal zone, peritrigeminal zone, lateral pontine zone, median sulcus, infracollicular zone, supracollicular zone, olivary zone, lateral medullary zone, and anterolateral sulcus. The microanatomy, safety, and approaches are discussed.CONCLUSIONS PLI and 11.7-T MRI data show that a neurosurgeon possibly does not need to consider the microana-tomical structures that would not be visible on conventional MRI and tractography when entering the mentioned safe entry zones. However, the detailed anatomical images may help neurosurgeons increase their understanding of the internal architecture of the human brainstem, which in turn could lead to safer neurosurgical intervention.

N2  -  Aim: Management of thalamic abscess is being considered as a contentious issue in neurosurgery. Regarding these lesions, besides removing the abscess, the most minimal morbidity is targeted during surgery and planning. Material and Method: A 5-year-old female presented with the symptoms of altered consciousness and left hemiparesis. Her medical history pointed out that she was being followed up for a congenital cardiac anomaly consisting of transposition of the great arteries and a ventricular septal defect. A cranial MRI revealed 2 masses with peripheral contrast enhancement in the right frontal and thalamic regions. She was operated immediately and the right frontal mass, compatible with abscess, was totally excised with frontal mini craniotomy. The patient was hospitalized and followed up under intensive parenteral antibiotics. Control cranial imaging revealed progression in the size of the thalamic abscess, which was corroborative with the increased left hemiparesis. MR tractography was obtained and the patient underwent MR navigation and tractography combined neuronavigation-assisted transcranial neuroendoscopic aspiration of the thalamic abscess. Results: The patient was stable in the early and late postoperative periods and her hemiparesis showed a dramatic recovery with no additional neurological deficits. Conclusion: Neuronavigation is considered as one of the techniques that aid the neurosurgeon to augment the success of surgery and minimize the morbidity, especially in critically localized lesions, i.e., eloquent areas. Combining MR navigation with MR tractography images and using them during neuronavigation to assist endoscopic procedures may decrease the surgical morbidity as much as possible.

N2  -  Scientific Background: During surgeries near the motor cortex the sensori-motor cortex is commonly identified with anatomical markers by the surgeon. These surgeries may be associated with a high risk of motor deficits and preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging, tractography, or intraoperative electrophysiological techniques such as phase reversal somatosensorial evoked potential (PR-SEP) monitoring and/or cortical stimulation methods may be used to decrease the rate of postoperative deficits. PR-SEP has been reported to be an easy and reliable technique to exactly localize the central sulcus.
Objectives: The aim of this study is to report the results of PR-SEP studies performed in our institution in surgeries near the motor cortex.; Material and Methods: Eleven male and 4 female patients with ages between 11-68 were monitorized with PR-SEP during the period of February 2006-2008 at Yeditepe University Hospital, Neurological Sciences Department.; Results: In 13 patients (%86,6) the central sulcus was localized with PR-SEP, and none of our patients had a new postoperative motor deficit. In 2 patients (%13,3) the central sulcus localization was not successful.; Conclusions: It has been reported that, PR-SEP is an easy method to localize the central sulcus and is successful in 80-90% of the cases. Similarly in our study this method was succesfull in 86% of the patients. We conclude that as an addition to the preoperative imaging techniques and intraoperative anatomical localization, PR-SEP is an easy and reliable method to guide the surgeon for the surgeries near the motor cortex in order to decrease the postoperative motor deficits.

N2  -  BackgroundTwo Centuries from today, Karl Friedrich Burdach attributed the nomenclature "arcuate fasciculus" to a white matter (WM) pathway connecting the frontal to the temporal cortices by arching around the Sylvian fissure. Although this label remained essentially unvaried, the concepts related to it and the characterization of the structural properties of this bundle evolved along with the methodological progress of the past years. Concurrently, the functional relevance of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) classically restricted to the linguistic domain has extended to further cognitive abilities. These features make it a relevant structure to consider in a large variety of neurosurgical procedures. ObjectiveHerein, we build on our previous review uncovering the connectivity provided by the Superior Longitudinal System, including the AF, and provide a handy representation of the structural organization of the AF by considering the frequency of defined reports in the literature. By adopting the same approach, we implement an account of which functions are mediated by this WM bundle. We highlight how this information can be transferred to the neurosurgical field by presenting four surgical cases of glioma resection requiring the evaluation of the relationship between the AF and the nearby structures, and the safest approaches to adopt. ConclusionsOur cumulative overview reports the most common wiring patterns and functional implications to be expected when approaching the study of the AF, while still considering seldom descriptions as an account of interindividual variability. Given its extension and the variety of cortical territories it reaches, the AF is a pivotal structure for different cognitive functions, and thorough understanding of its structural wiring and the functions it mediates is necessary for preserving the patient's cognitive abilities during glioma resection.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: In recent years, transcranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Focused Ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) treatments for functional neurological disorders are giving a new thrust to the field of therapeutic brain lesioning.
OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a patient affected by tremor combined with Parkinsonism who underwent a second tcMRgFUS thalamotomy because of relapsing tremor after a few months from the first tcMRgFUS treatment.; METHODS: A 72-yr-old, right-handed man, came to our observation because of a disabling tremor affecting his upper limbs, refusing any invasive surgical procedure and already treated by tcMRgFUS left Vim thalamotomy. However, clinical benefit had brief duration, as a progressive recurrence of tremor on the right upper limb was observed after a few months from the first treatment. Thus, the patient underwent a new left-sided tcMRgFUS procedure 6 mo after the former treatment.; RESULTS: After the second procedure, an immediate and complete relief from tremor on the right upper limb was achieved with clinical benefit that persisted up to a 6-mo follow-up.; CONCLUSION: Since tcMRgFUS doesn't use ionizing radiations and it is incision-less, repeated and staged treatment procedures have always been hypothesized. Our report suggests that tcMRgFUS retreatment might actually be a feasible, safe, and effective option in selected patients in whom an optimal clinical outcome is not achieved after the first treatment session. However, future well-designed studies in large samples are needed to assess the possible risks of retreatment and the optimal timing of reintervention as well as eligibility and exclusion criteria.

N2  -  Purpose of Review Subcortical structures have long been thought to play a role in language processing. Increasingly spirited debates on language studies, arising from as early as the nineteenth century, grew remarkably sophisticated as the years pass. In the context of non-thalamic aphasia, a few theoretical frameworks have been laid out. The disconnection hypothesis postulates that basal ganglia insults result in aphasia due to a rupture of connectivity between Broca and Wernicke's areas. A second viewpoint conjectures that the basal ganglia would more directly partake in language processing, and a third stream proclaims that aphasia would stem from cortical deafferentation. On the other hand, thalamic aphasia is more predominantly deemed as a resultant of diaschisis. This article reviews the above topics with recent findings on deep brain stimulation, neurophysiology, and aphasiology. Recent Findings The more recent approach conceptualizes non-thalamic aphasias as the offspring of unpredictable cortical hypoperfusion. Regarding the thalamus, there is mounting evidence now pointing to leading contributions of the pulvinar/lateral posterior nucleus and the anterior/ventral anterior thalamus to language disturbances. While the former appears to relate to lexical-semantic indiscrimination, the latter seems to bring about a severe breakdown in word selection and/or spontaneous top-down lexical-semantic operations. The characterization of subcortical aphasias and the role of the basal ganglia and thalamus in language processing continues to pose a challenge. Neuroimaging studies have pointed a path forward, and we believe that more recent methods such as tractography and connectivity studies will significantly expand our knowledge in this particular area of aphasiology.

N2  -  Safe Trajectory planning for navigation guided biopsy (nBx) of motor eloquent tumours (METs) is important to minimise neurological morbidity. Preliminary clinical data suggest that visualisation of the corticospinal tract (CST) and its relation to the tumour may aid in planning a safe trajectory. In this article we assess the impact of tractography in nBx planning in a simulation-based exercise. This single centre cross-sectional study was performed in March 2021 including 10 patients with METs divided into 2 groups: (1) tractography enhanced group (T-nBx; n = 5; CST merged with volumetric MRI); (2) anatomy-based group (A-nBx; n = 5; volumetric MRI only). A biopsy target was chosen on each tumour. Volunteer neurosurgical trainees had to plan a suitable biopsy trajectory on a Stealth S8(R) workstation for all patients in a single session. A trajectory safety index (TSI) was devised for each trajectory. Data collection and analysis included a comparison of trajectory planning time, trajectory/lobe changes and TSI. A total of 190 trajectories were analysed based on participation from 19 trainees. Mean trajectory planning time for the entire cohort was 225.1 +/- 21.97 s. T-nBx required shorter time for planning (p = 0.01). Mean trajectory changes and lobe changes made per biopsy were 3.28 +/- 0.29 and 0.45 +/- 0.08, respectively. T-nBx required fewer trajectory/lobe changes (p = 0.01). TSI was better in the presence of tractography than A-nBx (p = 0.04). Neurosurgical experience of trainees had no significant impact on the measured parameters despite adjusted analysis. Irrespective of the level of neurosurgical training, surgical planning of navigation guided biopsy for METs may be achieved in less time with a safer trajectory if tractography imaging is available.

N2  -  Background
Extent of resection is considered to be a prognostic factor in neuro-oncology. Intraoperative imaging technologies are designed to help achieve this goal. It is not clear whether any of these sometimes very expensive tools (or their combination) should be recommended as standard care for people with brain tumours. We set out to determine if intraoperative imaging technology offers any advantage in terms of extent of resection over standard surgery and if any one technology was more effective than another.; Objectives; To establish the overall effectiveness and safety of intraoperative imaging technology in resection of glioma. To supplement this review of effects, we also wished to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a Brief Economic Commentary (BEC).; Search methods; We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to June, week 4, 2017), and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 27). We searched the reference lists of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology, from 1991 to 2017, including all conference abstracts. We contacted neuro-oncologists, trial authors, and manufacturers regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.; Selection criteria; Randomised controlled trials evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included intraoperative MRI (iMRI), fluorescence-guided surgery, ultrasound, and neuronavigation (with orwithout additional image processing, e.g. tractography).; Data collection and analysis; Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a prespecified pro forma.; Main results; We identified four randomised controlled trials, using different intraoperative imaging technologies: iMRI (2 trials including 58 and 14 participants, respectively); fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (1 trial, 322 participants); and neuronavigation (1 trial, 45 participants). We identified one ongoing trial assessing iMRI with a planned sample size of 304 participants for which results are expected to be published around autumn 2018. We identified no trials for ultrasound.; Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to differences in the tumours included (eloquent versus non-eloquent locations) and variations in the image guidance tools used in the control arms (usually selective utilisation of neuronavigation). There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies. All studies included people with high-grade glioma only.; Extent of resection was increased in one trial of iMRI (risk ratio (RR) of incomplete resection 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.96; 1 study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence) and in the trial of 5-ALA (RR of incomplete resection 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). The other trial assessing iMRI was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis including 14 participants, therefore the trial provides very low-quality evidence. The trial of neuronavigation provided insufficient data to evaluate the effects on extent of resection.; Reporting of adverse events was incomplete and suggestive of significant reporting bias (very low-quality evidence). Overall, reported events were low in most trials. There was no clear evidence of improvement in overall survival with 5-ALA (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival data were not available in an appropriate format for analysis. Data for quality of life were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias (very low-quality evidence).; Authors'conclusions; Intra-operative imaging technologies, specifically iMRI and 5-ALA, may be of benefit in maximising extent of resection in participants with high grade glioma. However, this is based on low to very low quality evidence, and is therefore very uncertain. The short-and long-term neurological effects are uncertain. Effects of image-guided surgery on overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life are unclear. A brief economic commentary found limited economic evidence for the equivocal use of iMRI compared with conventional surgery. In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that compared with standard surgery use of image-guided surgery has an uncertain effect on costs and that 5-aminolevulinic acid was more costly. Further research, including studies of ultrasound-guided surgery, is needed.

N2  -  Background: Sensorimotor beta oscillations are increased in Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the alteration of dopaminergic transmission. This electrophysiological read-out is reported both in patients and in animal models such as the 6-OHDA rat model obtained with unilateral nigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Current treatments, based on dopaminergic replacement, transiently normalize this pathological beta activity and improve patients' quality of life.Objectives: We wanted to assess in vivo whether the abnormal beta oscillations can be correlated with impaired striatal or cortical excitability of the sensorimotor system and modulated by the pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic system. Methods: In the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model and control animals, we used intra-striatal and intra-cortical singlepulse electrical stimulation (SPES) and concurrent local field potentials (LFP) recordings. In the two groups, we quantified basal cortico-striatal excitability from time-resolved spectral analyses of LFP evoked responses induced remotely by intracerebral stimulations. The temporal dependance of cortico-striatal excitability to dopaminergic transmission was further tested using electrophysiological recordings combined with levodopa injection.Results: LFP evoked responses after striatal stimulation showed a transient reduction of power in a large timefrequency domain in the 6-OHDA group compared to the sham group. This result was specific to the striatum, as no significant difference was observed in cortical LFP evoked responses between the two groups. This impaired striatal excitability in the 6-OHDA group was observed in the striatum at least during the first 3 months after the initial lesion. In addition, the striatum responses to SPES during a levodopa challenge showed a transient potentiation of the decrease of responsiveness in frequencies below 40 Hz.Conclusion: The spectral properties of striatal responses to SPES show high sensitivity to dopaminergic transmission in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model. We thus propose that this approach could be used in preclinical models as a time-resolved biomarker of impaired dopaminergic transmission capable of monitoring progressive neurodegeneration and/or challenges to drug intake.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: We sought to report the operative techniques of the endoscopic supracerebellar transtentorial approach (ESTA) to the atrium of the lateral ventricle, especially focusing on the role of the endoscope and analyzing optically related issues.
METHODS: A retrospective data review was performed on 5 patients with lesions in the atrium of the lateral ventricle undergoing the ESTA. The patients were positioned in the three quarters prone position, and a paramidline linear incision was used. After performing a suboccipital craniotomy extending immediately above the transverse sinus and tentorium incision with precisely neuronavigation, corticotomy in the posterior mediobasal temporal region created a corridor to the tumor. All of the procedures were performed with an endoscope in a pneumatic arm holder. The preoperative and postoperative perimetry test and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking of the optic radiations were compared and analyzed.; RESULTS: Three patients had meningiomas, and 2 patients had high-grade gliomas in the atrium. The meningiomas were totally removed, and the gliomas were subtotally resected. One patient with glioblastoma died 2 months later after surgery because of the tumor progression; the remaining 4 patients had a visual field deficit without any other neurologic complications. The endoscope improved the surgical viewing angle, which was restricted by the microscope and slope of the tentorium.; CONCLUSIONS: ESTA is an alternative route to the atrium of the lateral ventricle. However, the collateral sulcus, which is highly relied on in neuronavigation, is illegible in the limited area. And the visual field deficit remains the primary challenge with this approach.

N2  -  BACKGROUND After approval for clinical use in 2017, early investigations of ultra-high-field abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have demonstrated its feasibility as well as diagnostic capabilities in neuroimaging. However, there are no to few systematic reviews covering the entirety of its neurosurgical applications as well as the trends in the literature with regard to the aforementioned application. AIM To assess the impact of 7-Tesla MRI (7T MRI) on neurosurgery, focusing on its applications in diagnosis, treatment planning, and postoperative assessment, and to systematically analyze and identify patterns and trends in the existing literature related to the utilization of 7T MRI in neurosurgical contexts. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed was conducted for studies published between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023, using MeSH terms related to 7T MRI and neurosurgery. The inclusion criteria were: Studies involving patients of all ages, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and original research. The exclusion criteria were: Pre-prints, studies with insufficient data (e.g., case reports and letters), non-English publications, and studies involving animal subjects. Data synthesis involved standardized extraction forms, and a narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS We identified 219 records from PubMed within our defined period, with no duplicates or exclusions before screening. After screening, 125 articles were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, leaving 94 reports. Of these, 2 were irrelevant to neurosurgery and 7 were animal studies, resulting in 85 studies included in our systematic review. Data were categorized by neurosurgical procedures and diseases treated using 7T MRI. We also analyzed publications by country and the number of 7T MRI facilities per country was also presented. Experimental studies were classified into comparison and non-comparison studies based on whether 7T MRI was compared to lower field strengths. CONCLUSION 7T MRI holds great potential in improving the characterization and understanding of various neurological and psychiatric conditions that may be neurosurgically treated. These include epilepsy, pituitary adenoma, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular diseases, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic head injury, multiple sclerosis, glioma, and psychiatric disorders. Superiority of 7T MRI over lower field strengths was demonstrated in terms of image quality, lesion detection, and tissue characterization. Findings suggest the need for accelerated global distribution of 7T magnetic resonance systems and increased training for radiologists to ensure safe and effective integration into routine clinical practice.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Bilateral anterior capsulotomy (BAC) is an effective surgical option for patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRMD) and treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (TROCD). The size of the lesion and its precise dorsalventral location within the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) remain undefined.
OBJECTIVE: To present a method to identify the trajectories of the associative and limbic white matter pathways within the ALIC for targeting in BAC surgery.; METHODS: Using high-definition tractography, we prospectively tested the feasibility of this method in 2 patients with TRMD and TROCD to tailor the capsulotomy lesion to their limbic pathway.; RESULTS: The trajectories of the associative and limbic pathways were identified in the ALIC of both patients and we targeted the limbic pathways by defining the dorsal limit of the lesion in a way to minimize the damage to the associative pathways. The final lesions were smaller than those that have been previously published. This individualized procedure was associated with long-term benefit in both patients.; CONCLUSION: Tractography-guided capsulotomy is feasible and was associated with long-term benefit in patients with TRMD and TROCD.

N2  -  In the case of resection of gliomas involving eloquent areas, equal consideration should be given to maintain maximal extent of resection (EOR) and neurological protection, for which the intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) proves an effective and admirable approach. IONM techniques applied in clinical practice currently consist of somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), direct electrical stimulation (DES), motor evoked potential (MEP), electromyography (EMG), and electrocorticography (ECoG). The combined use of DES and ECoG has been adopted widely. With the development of technology, more effective IONM tactics and programs would be proposed. The ultimate goal would be strengthening the localization of eloquent areas and epilepsy foci, reducing the incidence of postoperative dysfunction and epilepsy improving the life quality of patients.

N2  -  To analyze the pathways to brainstem tumors in childhood, as well as safe entry zones.
We conducted a retrospective study of 207 patients less than 18 years old who underwent brainstem tumor resection by the first author (Cavalheiro, S.) at the Neurosurgical Service and Pediatric Oncology Institute of the So Paulo Federal University from 1991 to 2011.; Brainstem tumors corresponded to 9.1 % of all pediatric tumors operated in that same period. Eleven previously described "safe entry zones" were used. We describe a new safe zone located in the superior ventral pons, which we named supratrigeminal approach. The operative mortality seen in the first 2 months after surgery was 1.9 % (four patients), and the morbidity rate was 21.2 %.; Anatomic knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic brainstem structures, in association with a refined neurosurgical technique assisted by intraoperative monitoring, and surgical planning based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tractography have allowed for wide resection of brainstem lesions with low mortality and acceptable morbidity rates.

N2  -  The brain's plasticity in response to sensory deprivation and other perturbations is well established. While the functional properties of the reorganized areas are under vigorous investigation, the factors that constrain cortical reorganization remain poorly understood. One factor constraining such reorganization may be long-distance subcortical connectivity between relevant cortical regions-reorganization attempts to preserve the functionality of subcortical connections. Here we provide human neurophysiological evidence for the role of the subcortical connections in shaping cortical reorganization of the networks involved in object naming following perturbation of normal function. We used direct electrical stimulation (DES) during surgical removal of gliomas to identify the sites that are involved in naming different categories of objects. The sites that were selectively inhibited in naming either living or non-living objects were displaced relative to those observed with other subject populations, possibly reflecting cortical reorganization due to slowly evolving brain damage. Subcortical DES applied to the white matter underlying these regions also led to category-specific naming deficits. The existence of these subcortical fiber pathways was confirmed using diffusion tensor tractography. These results constitute the first neurophysiological evidence for the critical role of subcortical pathways as part of the neural circuits that are involved in object naming; they also highlight the importance of subcortical connectivity in shaping cortical reorganization following perturbations of normal function.

N2  -  Objective Subthalamotomy is an effective alternative for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, uncertainty about the optimal target location and the possibility of inducing haemichorea-ballism have limited its application. We assessed the correlation between the topography of radiofrequency-based lesions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with motor improvement and the emergence of haemichorea-ballism.
Methods Sixty-four patients with PD treated with subthalamotomy were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRSm), MRI and tractography. Patients were classified according to the degree of clinical motor improvement and dyskinesia scale. Lesions were segmented on MRI and averaged in a standard space. We examined the relationship between the extent of lesion-induced disruption of fibres surrounding the STN and the development of haemichorea-ballism.; Results Maximum antiparkinsonian effect was obtained with lesions located within the dorsolateral motor region of the STN as compared with those centre-placed in the dorsal border of the STN and the zona incerta (71.3%, 53.5% and 20.8% UPDRSm reduction, respectively). However, lesions that extended dorsally beyond the STN showed lower probability of causing haemichoreaballism than those placed entirely within the nucleus. Tractography findings indicate that interruption of pallidothalamic fibres probably determines a low probability of haemichorea-ballism postoperatively.; Conclusions The topography of the lesion is a major factor in the antiparkinsonian effect of subthalamotomy in patients with PD. Lesions involving the motor STN and pallidothalamic fibres induced significant motor improvement and were associated with a low incidence of haemichorea-ballism.

N2  -  In the past, the cerebellum was considered to be substantially involved in sensory-motor coordination. However, a growing number of neuroanatomical, neuroimaging, clinical and lesion studies have now provided converging evidence on the implication of the cerebellum in a variety of cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral processes as well. These findings suggest a complex anatomo-functional organization of the cerebellum, involving a dense network of cortical territories and reciprocal connections with many supra-tentorial association areas. The final architecture of cerebellar networks results from a complex, highly protracted, and continuous development from childhood to adulthood, leading to integration between short-distance connections and long-range extra-cerebellar circuits. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the anatomo-functional organization of the cerebellar connectome. We will focus on the maturation process of afferent and efferent neuronal circuitry, and the involvement of these networks in different aspects of neurocognitive processing. The final section will be devoted to identifying possible implications of this knowledge in neurosurgical practice, especially in the case of posterior fossa tumor resection, and to discuss reliable strategies to improve the quality of approaches while reducing postsurgical morbidity.

N2  -  Direct electrical stimulation mapping was used to map executive functions during awake surgery of a patient with a right frontal low-grade glioma. We specifically targeted the frontal aslant tract, as this pathway had been infiltrated by the tumor. The right frontal aslant tract has been implicated in executive functions in the neuroscientific literature, but is yet of unknown relevance for clinical practice. Guided by tractography, electrical stimulation of the frontal aslant tract disrupted working memory and inhibitory functions. In this report we illustrate the dilemmas that neurosurgeons face when balancing maximal tumor resection against optimal cognitive performance. In particular, we emphasize that intraoperative tasks that target cognitive functions should be carefully introduced in clinical practice to prevent clinically irrelevant responses and too early termination of the resection.

N2  -  The cerebellum is historically implicated in motor coordination, but accumulating modern evidence indicates involvement in non-motor domains, including cognition, emotion, and language. This correlates with the symptoms observed in postoperative cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS). Profound knowledge of cerebellar functional topography and tractography is important when approaching cerebellar tumors, as surgical trauma to relevant structures of cerebellar pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of CMS. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a concise overview of relevant modern neuroimaging data and cerebellar functional tracts with regard to neurosurgical procedures.

N2  -  Background: Resection of meningioma located at primary motor cortex (PMC) is a great challenge to neurosurgeons due to the possibility of motor cortex injury and drainage venous damage during surgery. Here, we presented our experience in resection of PMC meningioma, with the assistance of preoperative multi-model image planning and intraoperative electrophysiological monitor. By these techniques, patients in our study achieved gross tumor resection (GTR) with appropriate motor cortex and drainage venous protection, and the patients recovered well with less neurologic deficits.
Methods: Thirty patients of PMC meningioma were selected for the study during January 2014 to December 2015. All the patients were performed head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and functional MRI scan before surgery, then all the imaging data were transferred to dextroscope workstation for virtual reality (VR) planning, to display the relationship of tumor, drainage venous and motor cortex. During the operation, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) was firstly used to locate the central sulcus (CS) and define the PMC area. Then the tumors were carefully removed by avoiding damage the cortex and drainage venous. After tumor resection, motor-evoked potentials (MEP) was applied to evaluate the motor function reservation.; Results: All the patients received preoperative image planning, and the relationships of tumor, drainage venous and motor cortex were clearly presented. With the application of SSEP monitor, the CS was firstly determined before tumor resection. Twenty-five cases in our study achieved radical resection of Simpson I, and 5 cases were Simpson II resection. After tumor resection, MEP monitor was used to confirm the preservation of motor function. Four patients suffered from moderate muscle strength decrease postoperatively, 10 patients experienced slight muscle strength decrease, while other 16 patients shared normal muscle strength as preoperative status. When discharge, those affected patients were recommended for further movement rehabilitation therapy.; Conclusions: Preoperative multi-model image planning and intraoperative electrophysiological monitor are very useful techniques for resection of PMC meningioma. They could help decrease motor cortex damage and protect the drainage venous during surgery, which is much safer and benefit patient for better prognosis.

N2  -  Phonemic and semantic fluency are neuropsychological tests widely used to assess patients' language and executive abilities and are highly sensitive tests in detecting language deficits in glioma patients. However, the networks that are involved in these tasks could be distinct and suggesting either a frontal (phonemic) or temporal (semantic) involvement.42 right-handed patients (26 male, mean age = 52.5 years, SD=+/- 13.3) were included in this retrospective study. Patients underwent awake (54.8%) or asleep (45.2%) surgery for low-grade (16.7%) or high-grade-glioma (83.3%) in the frontal (64.3%) or temporal lobe (35.7%) of the left (50%) or right (50%) hemisphere. Preoperative tractography was reconstructed for each patient, with segmentation of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-III), frontal aslant tract (FAT), and cortico-spinal tract (CST). Post-operative percentage of damage and disconnection of each tract, based on the patients' surgical cavities, were correlated with verbal fluencies scores at one week and one month after surgery. Analyses of differences between fluency scores at these timepoints (before surgery, one week and one month after surgery) were performed; lesion-symptom mapping was used to identify the correlation between cortical areas and post-operative scores.Immediately after surgery, a transient impairment of verbal fluency was observed, that improved within a month. Left hemisphere lesions were related to a worse verbal fluency performance, being a damage to the left superior frontal or temporal gyri associated with phonemic or semantic fluency deficit, respectively. At a subcortical level, disconnection analyses revealed that fluency scores were associated to the involvement of the left FAT and the left frontal part of the IFOF for phonemic fluency, and the association was still present one month after surgery. For semantic fluency, the correlation between post-surgery performance emerged for the left AF, UF, ILF and the temporal part of the IFOF, but disappeared at the follow-up.This approach based on the patients' pre-operative tractography, allowed to trace for the first time a dissociation between white matter pathways integrity and verbal fluency after surgery for glioma resection. Our results confirm the involvement of a frontal anterior pathway for phonemic fluency and a ventral temporal pathway for semantic fluency. Finally, our longitudinal results suggest that the frontal executive pathway requires a longer interval to recover compared to the semantic one.

N2  -  Secondary to the creation of a surgical corridor and retraction, white matter tracts degenerate, causing long-term scarring with potential neurological consequences. Third and lateral ventricle tumors require surgery that may lead to cognitive impairment. Our objective is to compare the long-term consequences of a transcortical transfrontal approach and an interhemispheric transcallosal approach on corpus callosum and frontal white matter tracts degeneration. Surgical patients with ventricular tumor accessible through both approaches were included and clinico-radiological data were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was the callosotomy length at 3-month post-operative T1 MRI, corrected by the extension of the tumor and the use of neuronavigation. Secondary outcomes included perioperative criteria such as bleeding, use of retractors and duration, FLAIR hypersignal on 3-month MRI, and re-do surgeries. To assess white matter tract interruption, 3-month FLAIR hypersignal was superposed to a tractography atlas. Seventy patients were included, 57 (81%) in the transfrontal group and 13 (19%) in the interhemispheric group. There was no difference in the mean callosotomy length on 3-month MRI (12.3 mm +/- 5.60 transfrontal vs 11.7 mm +/- 3.92 interhemispheric, p = 0.79) on univariate and multivariate analyses. The callosotomy length was inferior by - 3.13 mm for tumors located exclusively in the third ventricle (p = 0.016), independent of the approach. Retractors were used more often in transfrontal approaches (60% vs 33%, p < 0.001). The extent of frontal FLAIR hypersignal was higher after transfrontal approach (14.1 mm vs 0.525 mm, p < 0.001), correlated to the use of retractors (p < 0.05). After the interhemispheric approach, no tract other than corpus callosum was interrupted, whereas, after the transfrontal approach, frontal arcuate fibers and projections from the thalamus were interrupted in all patients, the cingulum in 19 (33%), the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus in 15 (26%), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in 2 (3%). Transfrontal and interhemispheric approaches to the third and lateral ventricles both lead to the same long-term damage to the corpus callosum, but the transfrontal approach interrupts several white matter tracts essential to cognitive tasks such as attention and planning, even in the non-dominant hemisphere. These results encourage all neurosurgeons to be familiar with both approaches and favor the interhemispheric approach when both can give access to the tumor with a comparable risk. Neuropsychological studies are necessary to correlate these anatomical findings to cognitive outcomes.

N2  -  The surgical management of brainstem glioma is challenging and has significant morbidity. Advances in surgical armamentarium has presented the opportunity to tackle these lesions. We present the case of a paediatric patient with a 2.3cm midbrain pilocytic astrocytoma. With the aid of tractography, neuro-navigation, 3-dimensional exoscope and a tubular retractor, near total resection of the tumour was achieved through a trans-sulcal para-fascicular approach without permanent injury to the corticospinal tract. To our knowledge this is the first report of a brainstem tumour resected using this approach and demonstrates what can be achieved with synergistic utility of evolving technologies in neurosurgery.

N2  -  Spinal cord tumors are a challenge for patients and neurosurgeons because of the high risk of neurologic deficits from the disease process and surgical interventions. Spinal cord tumors are uncommon, and approximately 2%-3% of primary intra-axial tumors of the central nervous system occur in the spinal cord. Primary intra-axial tumors are usually derived from neuroepithelial tissue, especially glial cells. This often leads to a classic intramedullary mass differential diagnosis of ependymoma or astrocytoma, which together constitute up to 70% of spinal cord tumors. For example, ependymomas occur predominantly in adults, and astrocytomas (specifically pilocytic astrocytomas) occur predominantly in children. While that is an excellent starting point, in order to refine the differential diagnosis, the authors review the radiologic-pathologic features of specific neoplastic categories and entities recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System and a few additional congenital-developmental entities. Radiologists can add value by providing a reasonable preoperative differential diagnosis for the patient and neurosurgeon, in many cases by favoring the most common conditions, and in other cases by identifying radiologic features that may point toward a less common entity. Some of the less common entities include intramedullary myxopapillary ependymoma, spinal subependymoma, and spinal hemangioblastoma. Whenever possible, the characteristic imaging features and locations of these tumors are explained or traced back to the underlying cell of origin and findings seen at histopathologic examination.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The feasibility and prognosis of surgical treatment for children with optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) is controversial. Therefore this study attempted to evaluate the effects of surgery and discuss prognostic factors related to the survival of children with symptomatic OPGs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred twenty-five children diagnosed with OPGs underwent surgery in the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital from 2003-2016. In this retrospective study, their demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and survival outcomes were investigated and summarized.; RESULTS: Among the 125 patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 84.1% and 70.6%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, patients who received postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after surgery had significantly better 5-year OS and PFS rates than patients who did not receive RT (P < 0.001 for both comparisons), patients who were 3 years old had better PFS rates than younger patients (P < 0.001), and patients with endocrinology symptoms had significantly worse PFS rates than patients with other symptoms (P 0.049). In the multiple regression analysis, postoperative treatment with RT and tumors with a lower pathologic grade were better predictors of OS. An age older than 3 years and postoperative treatment with RT were better predictors of PFS.; CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is safe and feasible for children with large volumes of OPGs and symptoms of functional impairment and obstructive hydrocephalus. Furthermore, adjuvant RT after surgery may significantly improve OS and PFS. The pathologic grade is an independent prognostic factor for OS, and the age at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for PFS.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 3-dimensional relationships of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) within the temporal stem using anatomic dissection and to study the surgical application.
METHODS: Ten postmortem human hemispheres (5 right, 5 left) were dissected using the Klingler fiber dissection technique. The 3-dimensional relationships of the IFOF with different landmarks of the temporal stem, insula, and temporal lobe were analyzed and measured.; RESULTS: An average distance of 10.9 mm (range, 8-15 mm) was observed between the limen insulae and the anterior edge of the IFOF under the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula. This anterior one-third of the temporal stem is crossed by the uncinate fasciculus. The IFOF crosses the posterior two-thirds of the temporal stem, in the space between the posterior limit of the uncinate fasciculus and the lateral geniculate body. The average superoinferior distance between the IFOF and the inferior limiting sulcus was 3.8 mm. The auditory radiations and the claustro-opercular and insulo-opercular fibers of the external and extreme capsules pass through the temporal stem above the IFOF, whereas the optic radiations pass below.; CONCLUSION: In the transsylvian approach to the mesiotemporal structures in the left dominant hemisphere, an incision within the posterior 8 mm from the limen insulae is less likely to damage the IFOF than more posterior incisions along the inferior limiting sulcus. In the temporal transopercular approach to left temporo-insular gliomas, the IFOF constitutes the deep functional limit of the resection within the temporal stem.

N2  -  Tractography has become a widely available tool for the planning of neurosurgical operations as well as for neuroscientific research. The absence of patient interaction makes it easily applicable. However, it leaves uncertainty about the functional relevance of the identified bundles. We retrospectively analyzed the correlation of white matter markers with their clinical function in 24 right-handed patients who underwent first surgery for high-grade glioma. Morphological affection of the corticospinal tract (CST) and grade of paresis were assessed before surgery. Tractography was performed manually with MRTrix3 and automatically with TractSeg. Median and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from manual tractography showed a significant correlation with CST affection (p = 0.008) and paresis (p = 0.015, p = 0.026). CST affection correlated further most with energy, and surface-volume ratio (p = 0.014) from radiomic analysis. Paresis correlated most with maximum 2D column diameter (p = 0.005), minor axis length (p = 0.006), and kurtosis (p = 0.008) from radiomic analysis. Streamline count yielded no significant correlations. In conclusion, mean or median FA can be used for the assessment of CST integrity in high-grade glioma. Also, several radiomic parameters are suited to describe tract integrity and may be used to quantitatively analyze white matter in the future.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Outcomes in high-grade glioma (HGG) remain poor despite maximal safe tumor resection. Although intraoperative MRI (iMRI) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) individually has demonstrated clinical benefit, their combined use has not been evaluated extensively. We sought to evaluate the benefit of combined use of iMRI and 5-ALA in patients with HGG who underwent craniotomy and tumor resection. METHODS: We identified 54 patients who underwent 5-ALA-guided resection of intracranial HGG. iMRI was used in 33 cases. Intraoperative ultrasound and frameless neuronavigation with tractography were used for all cases. Using standard MRI sequences, the extent of resection (EOR) of T1-weighted contrast-enhancing (T1WCE) tumor and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) signal tumor were calculated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in EOR of T1WCE tumor, volume of residual T1WCE tumor, and volume of residual FLAIR signal abnormality between the 5-ALA and iMRI + 5-ALA groups. Although the number of patients with complete resection did not differ significantly, more patients in the iMRI + 5-ALA group achieved resection of >53.21% of the FLAIR signal abnormality (20/31 vs 5/21, Pearson chi(2), P = .004), which is known to be a predictor of improved prognosis. No significant differences in overall survival or progression-free survival between the groups and no association between EOR and clinical outcomes were observed, which may be due to the size of this study. There was no difference in new neurological deficit between the groups at 30 days after surgery. CONCLUSION: Surgery with 5-ALA alone is as effective as surgery with 5-ALA and iMRI at achieving maximal safe resection, when combined with adjuncts. Our findings suggest that the role and interaction of these technologies needs to be further studied in larger, prospective studies to understand whether their utility is complementary or additive, particularly their influence on EOR of FLAIR signal abnormality and subsequent clinical outcomes.

N2  -  AbtractThe dichotomy of the cingulum bundle into the dorsal supracallosal and ventral parahippocampal parts is widely accepted; however, the retrosplenial component with its multiple alternative connections has not been revealed. The aim of this study was to delineate the microsurgical anatomy of a connectionally transition zone, the isthmic cingulum, in relation to the posteromedial interhemispheric access to the atrium and discuss the relevant patterns of glioma invasion on the basis of its fiber connections. White matter (WM) fibers were dissected layer by layer in a medial-to-lateral, lateral-to-medial, and posterior-to-anterior fashion. All related tracts and their connections were generated using deterministic tractography. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography findings were correlated with those of fiber dissection. A medial parieto-occipital approach to reach the atrium was performed with special emphasis on the cingulate isthmus and underlying WM connections. The isthmic cingulum, introduced as a retrosplenial connectional crossroad for the first time, displayed multiple connections to the splenium and the superior thalamic radiations. Another new finding was the demonstration of lateral hemispheric extension of the isthmic cingulum fibers through the base of the posterior part of the precuneus at the base of the parieto-occipital sulcus. The laterally crossing cingulum fibers were interconnected with three distinct association tracts: the middle longitudinal (MdLF), the inferior frontooccipital fasciculi (IFOF), and the claustro-cortical fibers (CCF). In the process of entry to the atrium during posterior interhemispheric approaches, the splenial and thalamic connections, as well as the laterally crossing fibers of the isthmic cingulum, were all in jeopardy. The connectional anatomy of the retrosplenial area is much more complicated than previously known. The isthmic cingulum connections may explain the concept of interhemispheric and medial to lateral cerebral hemisphere invasion patterns in medial parieto-occipital and posteromesial temporal gliomas. The isthmic cingulum is of key importance in posteromedial interhemispheric approaches to both: the atrium and the posterior mesial temporal lobe.

N2  -  Purpose Due to the lack of consensus on the management of glioblastoma patients, there exists variability amongst surgeons and centers regarding treatment decisions. Though, objective data about the extent of this heterogeneity is still lacking. We aim to evaluate and analyze the similarities and differences in neurosurgical practice patterns. Methods The survey was distributed to members of the neurosurgical societies of the Netherlands (NVVN), Europe (EANS), the United Kingdom (SBNS) and the United States (CNS) between January and March 2021 with questions about the selection of surgical modality and decision making in glioblastoma patients. Results Survey respondents (224 neurosurgeons) were from 41 countries. Overall, the most notable differences observed were the presence and timing of a multidisciplinary tumor board; the importance and role of various perioperative factors in the decision-making process, and the preferred treatment in various glioblastoma cases and case variants. Tumor boards were more common at academic centers. The intended extent of resection for glioblastoma resections in eloquent areas was limited more often in European neurosurgeons. We found a strong relationship between the surgeon's theoretical survey answers and their actual approach in presented patient cases. In general, the factors which were found to be theoretically the most important in surgical decision making were confirmed to influence the respondents' decisions to the greatest extent in practice as well. Discussion This survey illustrates the theoretical and practical heterogeneity among surgeons and centers in their decision making and treatment selection for glioblastoma patients. These data invite further evaluations to identify key variables that can be optimized and may therefore benefit from consensus.

N2  -  Simple Summary
Tractography enables the visualization of eloquent white matter pathways. Inaccuracies due to brain shift might occur intraoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based elastic fusion on preoperative tractography for subcortical resection of gliomas. We confirmed the high accuracy of tractography during the whole course of surgery.; When using preoperative tractography intraoperatively, inaccuracies due to brain shift might occur. Intraoperative tractography is rarely performed. Elastic fusion (EF) is a tool developed to compensate for brain shift, gravity, and tissue resection based on intraoperative images. Our hypothesis was that preoperative tractography is accurate and adjustments of tractography by intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI)-based EF (IBEF) compensate for brain shift. Between February 2018 and June 2019, 78 patients underwent eloquent (46 motor, 32 language) glioma resection in our department using intraoperative MRI. Mean distances between the resection cavity and tractography were analyzed and correlated with clinical outcomes. The mean +- standard deviation (range) distance after the application of IBEF was 5.0 +- 2.9 mm (0-10 mm) in patients without surgery-related motor deficits compared with 1.1 +- 1.6 mm (0-5 mm) in patients who showed new permanent surgery-related motor deficits postoperatively (p < 0.001). For language, the distance was 0.7 +- 1.2 mm (0-2 mm) in patients with new permanent deficits compared with 3.1 +- 4.5 mm (0-14 mm) in patients without new permanent surgery-related language deficits (p = 0.541). Preoperative tractography corrected by IBEF for subcortical resection of gliomas is highly accurate. However, at least for such subcortical anatomy, the severity of brain shift was considerably overestimated in the past.

N2  -  Background
Multiple studies have identified the prognostic relevance of extent of resection in the management of glioma. Different intraoperative technologies have emerged in recent years with unknown comparative efficacy in optimising extent of resection. One previous Cochrane Review provided low- to very low-certainty evidence in single trial analyses and synthesis of results was not possible. The role of intraoperative technology in maximising extent of resection remains uncertain. Due to the multiple complementary technologies available, this research question is amenable to a network meta-analysis methodological approach.; Objectives; To establish the comparative effectiveness and risk profile of specific intraoperative imaging technologies using a network meta-analysis and to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a brief economic commentary.; Search methods; We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via Ovid to May week 2 2020, and Embase via Ovid to 2020 week 20. We performed backward searching of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, Neuro-oncology and the Journal of Neuro-oncology from 1990 to 2019 including all conference abstracts. Finally, we contacted recognised experts in neuro-oncology to identify any additional eligible studies and acquire information on ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs).; Selection criteria; RCTs evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included fluorescence-guided surgery, intraoperative ultrasound, neuronavigation (with or without additional image processing, e.g. tractography), and intraoperative MRI.; Data collection and analysis; Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a prespecified pro forma.; Main results; We identified four RCTs, using different intraoperative imaging technologies: intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) (2 trials, with 58 and 14 participants); fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (1 trial, 322 participants); and neuronavigation (1 trial, 45 participants). We identified one ongoing trial assessing iMRI with a planned sample size of 304 participants for which results are expected to be published around winter 2020. We identified no published trials for intraoperative ultrasound.; Network meta-analyses or traditional meta-analyses were not appropriate due to absence of homogeneous trials across imaging technologies. Of the included trials, there was notable heterogeneity in tumour location and imaging technologies utilised in control arms. There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies.; One trial of iMRI found increased extent of resection (risk ratio (RR) for incomplete resection was 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.96; 49 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and one trial of 5-ALA (RR for incomplete resection was 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71; 270 participants; low-certainty evidence). The other trial assessing iMRI was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis including 14 participants; therefore, the trial provided very low-quality evidence. The trial of neuronavigation provided insufficient data to evaluate the effects on extent of resection.; Reporting of adverse events was incomplete and suggestive of significant reporting bias (very low-certainty evidence). Overall, the proportion of reported events was low in most trials and, therefore, issues with power to detect differences in outcomes that may or may not have been present. Survival outcomes were not adequately reported, although one trial reported no evidence of improvement in overall survival with 5-ALA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; 270 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data for quality of life were only available for one study and there was significant attrition bias (very low-certainty evidence).; Authors' conclusions; Intraoperative imaging technologies, specifically 5-ALA and iMRI, may be of benefit in maximising extent of resection in participants with high-grade glioma. However, this is based on low- to very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, the short- and long-term neurological effects are uncertain. Effects of image-guided surgery on overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life are unclear. Network and traditional meta-analyses were not possible due to the identified high risk of bias, heterogeneity, and small trials included in this review. A brief economic commentary found limited economic evidence for the equivocal use of iMRI compared with conventional surgery. In terms of costs, one non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that, compared with standard surgery, use of image-guided surgery has an uncertain effect on costs and that 5-ALA was more costly. Further research, including completion of ongoing trials of ultrasound-guided surgery, is needed.

N2  -  The resection of insular gliomas remains a neurosurgical challenge due to the close proximity of functionally important cortical, white matter tracts, and vasculature structures. More recently, the feasibility of resection has gained traction, however, there is a lack of consolidated neurological deficit metrics. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the incidences of neurological deficits following insular glioma resection to better guide selection algorithms and resource allocations. Searches of seven electronic databases from inception to August 2018 were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted and pooled using meta-analysis of proportions. Meta-regression was used to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Nineteen observational studies reported the neurological outcomes of 890 insular glioma patients. The pooled incidences of new temporary and permanent motor deficits were 11% (95% CI, 6-17%) and 4% (95% CI, 2-7%) respectively, and new temporary and permanent language deficits were 11% (95% CI, 6-17%) and 2% (95% CI, 0-4%) respectively. Single-surgeon series reported significantly lower incidences of both permanent motor (2% vs 7%; P < 0.001) and language (1% vs 3%; P = 0.03) deficits. The incidences of motor and language neurological deficits following insular glioma resection have been quantified, and will assist in determining the suitability and appropriateness of pursuing surgical resection for insular glioma. We note that permanent neurological deficits are lowest when reported by series describing outcomes of a single surgeon, indicating most optimal outcomes may be best achieved after intense training and/or greater experience.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Anatomic awareness of the structural connectivity of the brain is mandatory for neurosurgeons, to select the most effective approaches for brain resections. Although standard microdissection is a validated technique to investigate the different white matter (WM) pathways and to verify the results of tractography, the possibility of interactive exploration of the specimens and reliable acquisition of quantitative information has not been described. Photogrammetry is a well-established technique allowing an accurate metrology on highly defined three-dimensional (3D) models. The aim of this work is to propose the application of the photogrammetric technique for supporting the 3D exploration and the quantitative analysis on the cerebral WM connectivity.
METHODS: The main perisylvian pathways, including the superior longitudinal fascicle and the arcuate fascicle were exposed using the Klingler technique. The photogrammetric acquisition followed each dissection step. The point clouds were registered to a reference magnetic resonance image of the specimen. All the acquisitions were coregistered into an open-source model.; RESULTS: We analyzed 5 steps, including the cortical surface, the short intergyral fibers, the indirect posterior and anterior superior longitudinal fascicle, and the arcuate fascicle. The coregistration between the magnetic resonance imaging mesh and the point clouds models was highly accurate. Multiple measures of distances between specific cortical landmarks and WM tracts were collected on the photogrammetric model.; CONCLUSIONS: Photogrammetry allows an accurate 3D reproduction of WM anatomy and the acquisition of unlimited quantitative data directly on the real specimen during the postdissection analysis. These results open many new promising neuroscientific and educational perspectives and also optimize the quality of neurosurgical treatments.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Based on success with a prototype 1.5T intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) system and the desire for increased signal-to-noise ratio, along with its relationship to image quality and advanced applications, a 3.0T system that uses the same novel moveable magnet configuration was developed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical applicability by prospectively applying the higher-field system to a neurosurgical cohort.; METHODS: Upgrading to 3.0T required substantial modification of an existing iMRI-equipped operating room. The 1.5T magnet was replaced with a ceiling-mounted, moveable 3.0T magnet with a 70-cm working aperture. Local radiofrequency shielding was replaced with whole-room shielding. A new hydraulic operating table, high-performance gradients, and advanced image processing software were also installed. The new system was used as an adjunct to standard neurosurgical practice.; RESULTS: The iMRI system upgrade required 6 months. Since completion, the 3.0T iMRI system has successfully guided neurosurgery in 120 patients without system failure in a patient-focused environment. Intraoperative image quality was superior to that obtained at 1.5T and enabled intraoperative acquisition of advanced imaging sequences, including tractography. Intraoperative imaging was found to modify surgery in a substantial number of patients.; CONCLUSION: Implementation of an iMRI system based on a moveable 3.0T magnet is feasible. From clinical experience with 120 patients, iMRI at 3.0T is safe, reliable, and capable of directing image-guided surgery with exceptional image quality.
