N2  -  Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is one of the most recent products of Magnetic Resonance (MR) technology evolution. DWI has been proposed as a noninvasive tool for evaluating structural and physiologic states in biologic tissues as hyperacute ischemic changes within brain tissue. Recently, its more complex and detailed evolution, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), has been introduced and its clinical applications are the evaluation of anatomical structures and pathologic processes in white matter. White matter quantitative maps that indicate the integrity of brain tissue, color map, and tractography that identifies macroscopic three-dimensional architecture of fiber tracts (e.g., projections and association pathways) can be obtained with DTI.
Diffusion weighted imaging visualization techniques (ADC and Trace) are applied for the study of stroke, in the differential diagnosis of expansive lesions (e.g. epidermoid vs. arachnoid cyst) and in detecting traumatic and other lesions associated with restricted diffusion (e.g. MS plaques). On the other hand, DTI provides the identification of abnormalities in the otherwise normal appearing white matter with the understanding of the organization of the fibers, both in tumors and in other cortical or white matter diseases (including stroke, dementias, demyelinating-dismyelinating diseases, epilepsy, schizophrenia). Furthermore, in combination with functional MR, DTI might contribute to the comprehension of brain development, aging and connectivity, thus having a significant impact on brain functional studies.

N2  -  Due to their thermal energy, water molecules in tissue are in continuous random motion called diffusion. Water diffusion in pathologically modified tissue (e. g. ischemia, inflammation and neoplasia) is different from normal conditions. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (DWI) can measure the local strength and main direction of the diffusional motion in any picture element, thus providing diagnostic tissue information exceeding the morphological depiction.
Diffusion-weighted MR sequences are based on the echo planar imaging (EPI) technique which is very rapid but also susceptible to artefacts. Using especially strong magnetic field gradient pulses the MR signal is sensitized to microscopic motion of water molecules resulting in a unique image contrast in addition to T1 and T2. Local deviations of the diffusion strength from normal values indicate pathological processes. The DWI sequences can measure diffusion along any direction; however, in the clinical routine only directionally averaged DWI images (trace maps) are used. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) represents an advanced DWI method which specifically explores diffusional anisotropy in order to obtain additional information about tissue microstructure.; Diffusion-weighted MRI is an established technique for the assessment of pathological processes. Although DWI is mainly applied in stroke diagnostics, it is increasingly being used to detect and characterize various lesions in the brain as well as in the whole body. With new sequence techniques imaging artefacts can be significantly reduced. In addition, DTI allows the reconstruction and 3-dimensional visualization of tissue fibre structure. This method has proven to be clinically important primarily for the depiction of nerve tracts in the brain and spinal cord when planning surgical interventions and radiation therapy.

N2  -  Background and purpose The challenge of the neurosurgical management of gliomas lies in achieving a maximal resection without persistent functional deficit. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows non-invasive identification of white matter tracts and their interactions with the tumor. Previous DTI validation studies were compared with intraoperative cortical stimulation, but none was performed based on the tumor anatomopathological analysis. This preliminary study evaluates the correlation between the preoperative subcortical DTI tractography and histology in terms of fiber direction as well as potential tumor-related fiber disruption. Methods Eleven patients harboring glial tumors underwent preoperative DTI images. Correlations were performed between the visual color-coded anisotropy (FA) map analysis and the tumor histology after "en bloc" resection. Thirty-one tumor areas were classified according to the degree of tumor infiltration, the destruction of myelin fibers and neurofilaments, the presence of organized white matter fibers, and their orientation in space. Results After histologic comparison, the DTI sensitivity and specificity to predict disrupted fiber tracts were respectively of 89% and 90%. The positive and negative predicted values of DTI were 80% and 95%. The DTI data were in line with the histologic myelin fiber orientation in 90% of patients. In our series, the prevalence of destructed fiber was 31%. Glioblastoma WHO grade IV harbored a higher proportion of destructed white matter tracts. Lower WHO grades were associated with higher preservation of subcortical fiber tracts. Conclusion This DTI/histology study of "en bloc"-resected gliomas reported a high and reproducible concordance of the visual color-coded FA map with the histologic examination to predict subcortical fiber tract disruption. Our series brought consistency to the DTI data that could be performed routinely for glioma surgery to predict the tumor grade and the postoperative clinical outcomes.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography of the prostate for mapping of periprostatic neurovascular anatomy.
METHODS Eight men with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) underwent endorectal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate with DTI. Tract mapping was accomplished by positioning spherical regions of interest contiguously along the prostatic capsule at the prostatic apex, midgland, and base.; RESULTS DTI tractography of the prostate effectively visualized periprostatic fiber tract anatomy. There was no significant correlation between total tract number and prostate size, however (Spearman's coefficient = 0.33, P = .42). Variation in tract distribution existed. The total fiber mass was highest in the lower prostate hemisphere at the base of the prostate (mean = 36.9 vs 21.1, P = .0004) and in the upper hemisphere at the apex (mean = 41.6 vs 57.9, P = .006).; CONCLUSION DTI tractography successfully visualized fiber tracts around the prostate. Gold standard anatomic correlation is needed. UROLOGY 80: 219-223, 2012. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background Advanced modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion MR tractography offer in vivo information about brain networks and are therefore increasingly used for neurosurgical planning in children also. Aim This study aims to study the application of routine and advanced tractography algorithms and its comparison with intraoperative subcortical electrical stimulation.
Method Presurgical functional MRI and MR diffusion tractography were performed on a 6-year-old patient presenting with seizures, but no motor symptoms, due to a neuroectodermal tumor in the left central region. Three different tractography algorithms were compared: deterministic diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-tracking, probabilistic DTI-tracking, and probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution tracking (pCSD).; Results All three tractography algorithms could localize the core of the corticospinal tract with good agreement. The pCSD-tracking algorithm was more sensitive in revealing the anatomically most realistic fiber distribution and a proportion of fibers traversing a solid part of the tumor. Intraoperative stimulation confirmed these fibers close to the tumor. As a result, only a subtotal resection was performed, preventing postoperative sensorimotor deficits.; Conclusion Although, all tractography algorithms successfully identified the core of the corticospinal pathway, deterministic DTI-tractography, as widely used in clinical neuronavigation software, only insufficiently visualized critical fibers here. We believe these results argue for a stronger consideration of advanced tractography approaches in neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  Anisotropic diffusion MRI techniques using single-shell or multi-shell acquisitions have been proposed as a means to overcome some limitations imposed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), especially in complex models of fibre orientation distribution in voxels. A long acquisition time for the angular resolution of diffusion MRI is a major obstacle to practical clinical implementations. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve angular resolution of diffusion MRI acquisition using given diffusion gradient (DG) directions. First, we define a local diffusion pattern map of diffusion MR signals on a single shell in given DG directions. Using the local diffusion pattern map, we design a prediction scheme to determine the best DG direction to be synthesized within a nearest neighborhood DG directions group. Second, the local diffusion pattern map and the spherical distance on the shell are combined to determine a synthesized diffusion signal in the new DG direction. Using the synthesized and measured diffusion signals on a single sphere, we estimate a spin orientation distribution function (SDF) with human brain data. Although the proposed method is applied to SDF, a basic idea is to increase the angular resolution using the measured diffusion signals in various DG directions. The method can be applicable to different acquired multi-shell data or diffusion spectroscopic imaging (DSI) data. We validate the proposed method by comparing the recovered SDFs using the angular resolution enhanced diffusion signals with the recovered SDF using the measured diffusion data. The developed method provides an enhanced SDF resolution and improved multiple fiber structure by incorporating synthesized signals. The proposed method was also applied neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) using multi-shell acquisitions.

N2  -  In the last decades, a number of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) based techniques have been developed to study non-invasively human brain tissues, especially white matter (WM). In this context, Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is recognized as being able to accurately characterize water molecules displacement, as they emerge from the observation of MR diffusion weighted (MR-DW) images. CSD is suggested to be applied on MR-DW datasets consisting of b-values around 3,000 s/mm(2) and at least 45 unique diffusion weighting directions. Below such technical requirements, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DT) remains the most widely accepted model. Unlike CSD, DTI is unable to resolve complex fiber geometries within the brain, thus affecting related tissues quantification. In addition, thanks to CSD, an index called Apparent Fiber Density (AFD) can be measured to estimate intra-axonal volume fraction within WM. In standard clinical settings, diffusion based acquisitions are well below such technical requirements. Therefore, in this study we wanted to extensively compare CSD and DTI model outcomes on really low demanding MR-DW datasets, i.e., consisting of a single shell (b-value = 1,000 s/mm(2)) and only 30 unique diffusion encoding directions. To this end, we performed deterministic and probabilistic tractographic reconstruction of two major WM pathways, namely the Corticospinal Tract and the Arcuate Fasciculus. We estimated and analyzed tensor based features as well as, for the first time, AFD interpretability in our data. By performing multivariate statistics and tract-based ROI analysis, we demonstrate that WM quantification is affected by both the diffusion model and threshold applied to noisy tractographic maps. Consistently with existing literature, we showed that CSD outperforms DTI even in our scenario. Most importantly, for the first time we address the problem of accuracy and interpretation of AFD in a low-demanding DW setup, and show that it is still a biological meaningful measure for the analysis of intra-axonal volume even in clinical settings.

T2  -  WHITE MATTER IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE: ADVANCES IN DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING AND ITS APPLICATIONS

N2  -  The ability of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to probe the ultrastructural properties of biological tissues presents new possibilities for DTI-based tissue characterization, with the potential for greater pathologic specificity than conventional imaging methods. This is urgently needed in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral neoplasms, where clinical decisions depend on the ability to discriminate tumor-involved from uninvolved tissue, a major shortcoming of conventional imaging. Several investigators have attempted to make this determination on the basis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or the fractional anisotropy (FA), with mixed results. The directionally encoded color map, with hues reflecting tensor orientation and intensity weighted by FA, provides an aesthetic and informative summary of DTI features throughout the brain in an easily interpreted format. The use of these maps is becoming increasingly common in both basic and clinical research, as well as in purely clinical settings. These examples serve to demonstrate our approach to the quantitation of regional diffusion tensor distributions using directional statistical methods.

N2  -  Objectives-Recovery from focal motor pathway lesions may be associated with a functional reorganisation of cortical motor areas. Previous studies of the relation between structural brain damage and the functional consequences have employed MRI and CT, which provide Limited structural information. The recent development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) now provides quantitative measures of fibre tract integrity and orientation. The objective was to use DTI and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine the mechanisms underlying the excellent recovery found after a penetrating injury to the right capsular region.
Methods-DTI and fMRI were performed on the patient described; DTI was performed on five normal controls.; Results-The injury resulted in a left hemiplegia which resolved fully over several weeks. When studied 18 months later there was no pyramidal weakness, a mild hemidystonia, and sensory disturbance. fMRI activation maps showed contralateral primary and supplementary motor cortex activation during tapping of each hand; smaller ipsilateral primary motor areas were activated by the recovered hand only. DTI disclosed preserved structural integrity and orientation in the posterior capsular limb by contrast with the disrupted structure in the anterior limb on the injured side.; Conclusions-The findings suggest that the main recovery mechanism was a preservation of the integrity and orientation of pyramidal tract fibres. The fMRI studies do not suggest substantial reorganisation of the motor cortex, although ipsilateral pathways may have contributed to the recovery. The initial deficit was probably due to reversible local factors including oedema and mass effect; permanent damage to fibre tracts in the anterior capsular limb may account for the persistent sensory deficit. This study shows for the first time the potential value of combining fMRI and DTI together to investigate mechanisms of recovery and persistent deficit in an individual patient.

N2  -  Introduction Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a valuable non-invasive imaging modality for mapping white matter tracts and assessing microstructural integrity, and can be used as a "biomarker" in diagnosis, differentiation, and therapeutic monitoring. Although it has gained clinical importance as a marker of neuropathology, limitations in its interpretation underscore the need for caution. Methods This review provides an overview of the principles and clinical applicability of DTI. We focus on major white matter fiber bundles, detailing their normal anatomy and pathological DTI patterns, with emphasis on tracts routinely requested in our neurosurgical department in the preoperative context (uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, pyramidal pathway, optic radiation, and dentatorubrothalamic tract). Results We guide neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons in defining volumes of interest for mapping individual tracts and demonstrating their 3D reconstructions. The intricate trajectories of white matter tracts pose a challenge for accurate fiber orientation recording, with each bundle exhibiting specific characteristics. Tracts adjacent to brain lesions are categorized as displaced, edematous, infiltrated, or disrupted, illustrated with clinical cases of brain neoplasms. To improve structured reporting, we propose a checklist of topics for inclusion in imaging evaluations and MRI reports. Conclusion DTI is emerging as a powerful tool for assessing microstructural changes in brain disorders, despite some challenges in standardization and interpretation. This review serves an educational purpose by providing guidance for fiber monitoring and interpretation of pathological patterns observed in clinical cases, highlighting the importance and potential pitfalls of DTI in neuroradiology and surgical planning.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging and fiber tractography can be used to investigate alterations in white matter tracts in patients with early acquired brain lesions and cerebral palsy. Most existing studies have used diffusion tensor tractography, which is limited in areas of complex fiber structures or pathologic processes. We explored a combined normalization and probabilistic fiber-tracking method for more realistic fiber tractography in this patient group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 17 children with unilateral cerebral palsy and 24 typically developing controls. DWI data were collected at 1.5T (45 directions, b=1000 smm(2)). Regions of interest were defined on a study-specific fractional anisotropy template and mapped onto subjects for fiber tracking. Probabilistic fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract and thalamic projections to the somatosensory cortex was performed by using constrained spherical deconvolution. Tracts were qualitatively assessed, and DTI parameters were extracted close to and distant from lesions and compared between groups.; RESULTS: The corticospinal tract and thalamic projections to the somatosensory cortex were realistically reconstructed in both groups. Structural changes to tracts were seen in the cerebral palsy group and included splits, dislocations, compaction of the tracts, or failure to delineate the tract and were associated with underlying pathology seen on conventional MR imaging. Comparisons of DTI parameters indicated primary and secondary neurodegeneration along the corticospinal tract. Corticospinal tract and thalamic projections to the somatosensory cortex showed dissimilarities in both structural changes and DTI parameters.; CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method offers a sensitive means to explore alterations in WM tracts to further understand pathophysiologic changes following early acquired brain injury.

We describe a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which uses the diffusion energy of water to map white matter fibers. DTI has been established in other disorders such as metabolic, demyelinating and ischemic diseases. We describe the use of DTI in identifying white matter tracts such as optic radiations and avoiding them intraoperatively in 2 children with low-grade glial tumors.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Patients with small vessel disease show high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images that represent ischemic cell damage. However, despite a similar degree of ischemic change, the amount and the severity of clinical presentations may vary. We investigated the clinical correlations of ischemic changes using voxel-based morphometric analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).; METHODS; Twenty-seven MCI and 34 dementia patients were included who all had significant small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all patients, neuropsychological tests, a rating on the Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal scale (PEPS) for motor deficits, and 3-Tesla MRI including DTI scans were performed. Voxel-based analysis of the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were computed.; RESULTS; Cognitive scores correlated with the DTI abnormalities in supratentorial areas with regional specificity according to each cognitive test. Unexpectedly, cognitive deficits in most neuropsychological tests, even in some frontal tasks, were associated with disruption of posterior white matter integrities. Motor deficits correlated with both supra-and infratentorial lesions.; CONCLUSION; Our findings suggest that in patients with small vessel disease who show cognitive and motor impairments, a specific distribution of fiber tract damage is more related with clinical deficits than is the severity of the total ischemia.

N2  -  Brain mapping techniques (intraoperative neurophysiology and neuropsychology) represent the gold standard in glioma surgery, and particularly in glioma resection. Since the introduction of MRI in the clinical practice, several advanced applications have been developed, like functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion imaging-based tractography (DTI), which both have an application in glioma surgery. fMRI allows to identify cortical areas related to a specific function, DTI allows to reconstruct a model of the sub-cortical connectivity. This paper describes the clinical application of fMRI and DTI, enlightening sensitivity and specificity in comparison to gold standard and underlining their limitations in surgical decision making.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In view of the few large prospective studies available on the role of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and the potential of DTI in showing the relationship between tumor and white matter tracts, we studied the role of preoperative DTI in planning a safe surgical corridor, predicting the neurologic and surgical outcome and tumor characterization in supratentorial intra-axial brain tumors.
METHODS: We included 128 cases. Preoperative neurologic status and tumor volume were assessed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based surgical plan was decided and reviewed for changes after DTI (site of corticotomy or limit of resection) by senior faculty of neurosurgery and neuroradiologist. Tracts were classified as displaced, infiltrated, or disrupted. Postoperative neurologic and surgical outcome was assessed along with evaluation of association of DTI with tumor type.; RESULTS: DTI-based change in surgical corridor was seen in 60 patients (47%). Sixty-six patients harbored low-grade gliomas, 48 had high-grade gliomas, and 14 had metastastic lesions. Resectability (maximum safe resection) was higher in patients with displaced fibers and lower in those with disruptedinfiltrated fibers, which was statistically significant. Fewer patients had neurologic deterioration in the displaced category (7.1%) compared with the disruptedinfiltrated category (13.9%). Although no significant association could be established between neurologic outcome and fiber type, displaced fibers were associated mainly with low-grade glioma (71%), whereas disruptedinfiltrated fibers were associated mainly with high-grade glioma (66%); this correlation was significant.; CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative DTI is a landmark tool for planning a safe surgical corridor and predicting the tumor type along with neurologic and surgical outcome of patients.

N2  -  Recent technological advances have had a major impact on hardware and software used in the neurosciences leading to the development of highly sophisticated magnetic resonance (MR) sequences and image processing techniques closely correted to neuronal activity (functional MNR with BOLD contrast, fMRI; Diffusion MR, DWI-DTI). These imaging procedures disclose eloquent cortical brain areas and their respective connecting pathways (mediated by bundles of white matter fibres) allowing a better correlation in clinical practice between functional impairment and brain lesion. This has transformed MR from a scanning technique offering purely morphological information on brain pathology (dysfunctional neuroradiology) into functional neuroradiology. In the wake of functional neuroradiology research confined to physiological investigation, the new technique is now an important tool in the field of neurorehabilitation and neuropharmacology, pre-surgical mapping and the study of post-lesional plasticity. Pre-surgical planning is used not only for cerebral tumours but also for epilepsy surgery and interventional neuroradiological procedures for which fMRI and DTI findings may yield useful information on brain hemispheric dominance and the mechanisms responsible for the reorganization of brain functions.

N2  -  Surgical treatment of deep-seated lesions involving the corticospinal tract is one of the most challenging areas of contemporary neurosurgery, even given the recent development of radiological methods including three-dimensional anisotropy contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) axonography. Fibre tracking using diffusion tensor imaging is another MRI technique that can be used to visualize anisotropy and the orientation of white matter tracts in the brain. We report herein a patient with a paraventricular cavernous angioma manifesting as hemiparesis caused by haemorrhage. Preoperative conventional MRI failed to determine the anatomical relationship between the paraventricular lesion and the corticospinal tract, whereas fibre tracking using free software (dTV for MR-DTI analysis) indicated that the corticospinal tract was displaced anterolaterally from the medial side. The paraventricular lesion was completely removed without damaging the corticospinal tract using a transcortical transventricular approach. Preoperative fibre tracking is useful in surgical planning for procedures involving deep-seated lesions adjacent to the corticospinal tract, and may avoid postoperative morbidity due to corticospinal tract injury.

N2  -  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography has been widely used in brain tumor surgery to ensure thorough resection and minimize functional damage. However, due to enhanced anisotropic uncertainty in the area with peritumoral edema, diffusion tractography is generally not practicable leading to high false-negative results in neural tracking. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) derived tractography for investigating structural heterogeneity of the brain in patients with brain tumor. A total of 24 patients with brain tumors, characterized by peritumoral edema, and 10 healthy counterparts were recruited from 2014 to 2021. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, we used the images obtained from the healthy participants for calibrating the orientation dispersion threshold for NODDI-derived corticospinal tract (CST) reconstruction. Compared to DTI, NODDI-derived tractography has a great potential to improve the reconstruction of fiber tracking through regions of vasogenic edema. The regions with edematous CST in NODDI-derived tractography demonstrated a significant decrease in the intracellular volume fraction (VFic, p < 0.000) and an increase in the isotropic volume fraction (VFiso, p < 0.014). Notably, the percentage of the involved volume of the concealed CST and lesion-to-tract distance could reflect the motor function of the patients. After the tumor resection, four patients with 1-5 years follow-up were showed subsidence of the vasogenic edema and normal CST on DTI tractography. NODDI-derived tractography revealed tracts within the edematous area and could assist neurosurgeons to locate the neural tracts that are otherwise not visualized by conventional DTI tractography.

N2  -  Recently, we published a first anatomical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) atlas regarding white matter tracts in the canine brain. The purpose of this study was to show the significance of DTI in the revelation of the white matter fibres in the feline brain (i.e., to obtain an anatomical DTI atlas of images) and to descriptively compare these to previously obtained white matter fibre images of the canine brain. DTI MR Images of four cats euthanized for reasons other than neurological disorders were obtained with a 3 T system. Combined fractional anisotropic (FA) and directional maps were obtained within the hour after death. An experienced anatomist tracked white matter tracts of clinical relevance using the scanner software. After validation of these tracts, we compared relevant neurological connections between the cat and the dog. Comparison of cerebral structures between different species is easier when the three dimensional anatomy is visualized by using DTI. 3D rendered DTI images clearly show major differences in neurological architecture between cats and dogs for example, the more important space occupying role of the limbic system, and the less diffuse, less nodular, less pronounced and thinner fibre bundles in the feline brain compared to the canine brain (except for the cerebellum different parts connecting fibres passing through the brainstem which are pronouncedly developed).

N2  -  Our study investigates the potential of diffusion MRI (dMRI), including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fixel-based analysis (FBA) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), to detect microstructural tissue abnormalities in rats after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The brains of sham-operated and mTBI rats 35 days after lateral fluid percussion injury were imaged ex vivo in a 11.7-T scanner. Voxel-based analyses of DTI-, fixel- and NODDI-based metrics detected extensive tissue changes in directly affected brain areas close to the primary injury, and more importantly, also in distal areas connected to primary injury and indirectly affected by the secondary injury mechanisms. Histology revealed ongoing axonal abnormalities and inflammation, 35 days after the injury, in the brain areas highlighted in the group analyses. Fractional anisotropy (FA), fiber density (FD) and fiber density and fiber bundle cross-section (FDC) showed similar pattern of significant areas throughout the brain; however, FA showed more significant voxels in gray matter areas, while FD and FDC in white matter areas, and orientation dispersion index (ODI) in areas most damage based on histology. Region-of-interest (R01)-based analyses on dMRI maps and histology in selected brain regions revealed that the changes in MRI parameters could be attributed to both alterations in myelinated fiber bundles and increased cellularity. This study demonstrates that the combination of dMRI methods can provide a more complete insight into the microstructural alterations in white and gray matter after mTBI, which may aid diagnosis and prognosis following a mild brain injury.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography enables the in vivo visualization of white matter tracts inside normal brain tissue, which provides the neurosurgeon important information to plan tumor resections. However, DTI is associated with restrictions in the resolution of crossing fibers in the vicinity of the tumor or in edema. We find that generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) can overcome these difficulties and is advantageous over DTI for the tractography of the fiber bundle in peritumoral edema.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the differences between GQI and DTI in the preoperative mapping of fiber tractography in peritumoral edema of cerebral tumors, and discuss the clinical application of GQI in neurosurgical planning.; METHODS: Five patients with brain tumors underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scans, and the data were reconstructed by DTI and GQI. We adjusted the parameters and compared the differences between DTI and GQI in visualizing the fiber tracts in the peritumoral edema of cerebral tumors.; RESULTS: GQI and DTI showed substantial differences in displaying the nerve fibers in the edema surrounding the tumor. The GQI tractography method could fully display existing intact fibers in the edema, whereas the fiber tracts in edema displayed by DTI tractography were incomplete, missing, or ruptured.; CONCLUSION: GQI can visualize the tracts in the peritumoral edema of cerebral tumors better than DTI. Although GQI has many limitations, its future in the preoperative guidance of brain tumor lesions is promising.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI enabled in vivo microstructural imaging of the fiber tracts in the brain resulting in its application in a wide range of settings, including in neurological and neurosurgical disorders. Conventional approaches such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been shown to have limited applications due to the crossing fiber problem and the susceptibility of their quantitative indices to partial volume effects. To overcome these limitations, the recent focus has shifted to the advanced acquisition methods and their related analytical approaches. Advanced white matter imaging techniques provide superior qualitative data in terms of demonstration of multiple crossing fibers in their spatial orientation in a three dimensional manner in the brain. In this review paper, we discuss the advancements in diffusion MRI and introduce their roles. Using examples, we demonstrate the role of advanced diffusion MRI-based fiber tracking in neuroanatomical studies. Results from its preliminary application in the evaluation of intracranial space occupying lesions, including with respect to future directions for prognostication, are also presented. Building upon the previous DTI studies assessing white matter disease in Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; we also discuss approaches which have led to encouraging preliminary results towards developing an imaging biomarker for these conditions.

N2  -  Accurate localization of white matter fiber tracts in relation to brain tumors is a goal of critical importance to the neurosurgical community. White matter fiber tractography by means of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is the only non-invasive method that can provide estimates of brain connectivity. However, conventional tractography methods are based on data acquisition techniques that suffer from image distortions and artifacts. Thus, a large percentage of white matter fiber bundles are distorted, and/or terminated early, while others are completely undetected. This severely limits the potential of fiber tractography in pre-surgical planning and image-guided surgery. In contrast, Turboprop-DTI is a technique that provides images with significantly fewer distortions and artifacts than conventional DTI data acquisition methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fiber tracking results obtained from Turboprop-DTI data. It was demonstrated that Turboprop may be a more appropriate DTI data acquisition technique for tracing white matter fibers than conventional DTI methods, especially in applications such as pre-surgical planning and image-guided surgery.

N2  -  The neural substrate for song behavior in songbirds, the song control system (SCS), is thus far the best-documented brain circuit in which to study neuroplasticity and adult neurogenesis. Not only does the volume of the key song control nuclei change in size, but also the density of the connections between them changes as a function of seasonal and hormonal influences. This study explores the potentials of in vivo Diffusion-Tensor MRI (DT-MRI or DTI) to visualize the distinct, concentrated connections of the SCS in the brain of the starling (Sturnus vulgaris). In vivo DTI on starling was performed on a 7T MR system using sagittal and coronal slices. DTI was accomplished with diffusion gradients applied in seven non-collinear directions. Fractional Anisotropy (FA)-maps allowed us to distinguish most of the grey matter and white matter-tracts, including the laminae subdividing the avian telencephalon and the tracts connecting the major song control nuclei (e.g., HVC with RA and X). The FA-maps also allowed us to discern a number of song control, auditory and visual nuclei. Fiber tracking was implemented to illustrate the discrimination of all tracts running from and to RA. Because of the remarkable plasticity inherent to the songbird brain, the successful implementation of DTI in this model could represent a useful tool for the in vivo exploration of fiber degeneration and regeneration and the biological mechanisms involved in brain plasticity.

N2  -  Objectives: The application of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for the treatment of neurological conditions has been of increasing interest. Conventional MR imaging can provide structural information about the effect of MRgFUS, where differences in ablated tissue can be seen, but it lacks information about the status of the cellular environment or neural microstructure. We investigate in vivo acute changes in water diffusion and white matter tracts in the brain of a piglet model after MRgFUS treatment using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with histological verification of treatment-related changes.
Methods: MRgFUS was used to treat the anterior body of the fornix in four piglets. T1 and diffusion-weighted images were collected before and after treatment. Mean diffusion-weighted imaging (MDWI) images were generated to measure lesion volumes via signal intensity thresholds. Histological data were collected for volume comparison and assessment of treatment effect. DWI metric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) were generated for quantitative assessment. Fornix-related fiber tracts were generated before and after treatment for qualitative assessment.; Results: The volume of treated tissue measured via MDWI did not differ significantly from histological measurements, and both were significantly larger than the treatment cell volume. Diffusion metrics in the treatment region were significantly decreased following MRgFUS treatment, with the peak change seen at the lesion core and decreasing radially. Histological analysis confirmed an area of coagulative necrosis in the targeted region with sharp demarcation zone with surrounding brain. Tractography from the lesion core and the fornix revealed fiber disruptions following treatment.; Conclusions: Diffusion maps and fiber tractography are an effective method for assessing lesion volumes and microstructural changes in vivo following MRgFUS treatment. This study demonstrates that DWI has the potential to advance MRgFUS by providing convenient in vivo microstructural lesion and fiber tractography assessment after treatment.

N2  -  We investigate the correlation between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived metric statistics and motor strength grade of insular glioma patients after optimizing the pyramidal tract (PT) delineation. Motor strength grades of 45 insular glioma patients were assessed. All the patients underwent structural and diffusion MRI examination before and after surgery. We co-registered pre- and post-op datasets, and a two-tensor unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm was employed to delineate bilateral PTs after DWI pre-processing. The tractography results were voxelized, and their labelmaps were cropped according to the location of frontal and insular parts of the lesion. Both the whole and cropped labelmaps were used as regions of interest to analyze fractional anisotropy (FA) and Trace statistics; hence, their ratios were calculated (lesional side tract/contralateral normal tract). The combination of DWI pre-processing and two-tensor UKF algorithm successfully delineated bilateral PTs of all the patients. It effectively accomplished both full fiber delineation within the edema and an extensive lateral fanning that had a favorable correspondence to the bilateral motor cortices. Before surgery, correlations were found between patients' motor strength grades and ratios of PT volume and FA standard deviation (SD). Nearly 3 months after surgery, correlations were found between motor strength grades and the ratios of metric statistics as follows: whole PT volume, whole mean FA, and FA SD. We substantiated the correlation between DTI-derived metric statistics and motor strength grades of insular glioma patients. Moreover, we posed a workflow for comprehensive pre- and post-op DTI quantitative research of glioma patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND
Functional MRI (fMRI) combines anatomic with functional information and has therefore been widely used for preoperative planning of patients with mass lesions affecting functionally important brain regions. However, the courses of functionally important fiber tracts are not visualized. We therefore propose to combine fMRI with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) that allows visualization of large fiber tracts and to implement this data in a neuronavigation system.; METHODS; DWI was successfully performed at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla, employing a spin-echo sequence with gradient sensitivity in six noncollinear directions to visualize the course of the pyramidal tracts, and was combined with echo-planar T2* fMRI during a hand motor task in a patient with central cavernoma. RESULTS Fusion of both data sets allowed visualization of the displacement of both the primary sensorimotor area (M1) and its large descending fiber tracts. Intraoperatively, these data were used to aid in neuronavigation. Confirmation was obtained by intraoperative electrical stimulation. Postoperative MRI revealed an undisrupted pyramidal tract in the neurologically intact patient.; CONCLUSION; The combination of fMRI with DWI allows for assessment of functionally important cortical areas and additional visualization of large fiber tracts, Information about the orientation of fiber tracts in normal appearing white matter in patients with tumors within the cortical motor system cannot be obtained by other functional or conventional imaging methods and is vital for reducing operative morbidity as the information about functional cortex. This technique might, therefore, have the prospect of guiding neurosurgical interventions, especially when linked to a neuronavigation system. (C) 2002 by Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  -  Diffusion weighted imaging sequences are now widely available on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) of the brain is able to show white matter tracts and is now commonly used in human medicine to study brain anatomy, tumors, structural pathways,... The purpose of this study was to show the interest of DTI to reveal the white matter fibers in the dogs' brain. DTI MR Images for this study were obtained with a 3 T system of 4 dogs euthanized for other reasons than neurological disorders. Combined fractional anisotropic (FA) and directional maps were obtained in the first 2 hours after death. The heads were amputated immediately after scanning and stored in 10% formalin until preparation for dissection. An experienced anatomist tracked white matter tracts with clinical relevance using the scanner software. The selected tracts were REFVIDume rendered and correlated with gross dissection. Using DTI we were able to track relevant neurological connections, such as the corticospinal tract, the optic and the cerebellar tract. The three dimensional anatomy is better presented using modern visualization techniques. DTI seems to be a valuable tool in order to present clinically relevant white matter tracts to neurological clinicians and researchers. Anat Rec, 296:340349, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Purpose: To explore the feasibility of 3T magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking (FT) in patients with prostate cancer.
Materials and methods: Thirty consecutive patients (mean age, 62.5 years) with biopsy proven prostate cancer underwent 3T-MR imaging (MRI) and DTI using a 6-channel external phased-array coil before radical prostatectomy. Regions of interest of 14 pixels were defined in tumors and nonaffected areas in the peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG), according to histopatology after radical prostatectomy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were determined. Differences in mean ADC and FA values among prostate cancer, normal PZ and CG were compared by 2-sided Student t test. The predominant diffusion direction of the prostate anisotropy was color coded on a directionally encoded color (DEC) map. A 3D reconstruction of fiber tract orientations of the whole prostate was determined using the continuous tracking method. The overall image quality for tumor localization and local staging was assessed in retrospective matching with whole-mount section histopathology images. Nodules detected at MRI were classified as matched lesions if tumor presence and extension were evidenced at histopathology.; Results: For all the patients, the DTI sequence images were suitable for the evaluation of the zonal anatomy of the prostate gland and the tumor localization. Quantitative evaluation of the regions of interest (ROIs) showed a mean ADC value significantly lower in the peripheral neoplastic area (1.06 +- 0.37 X 10(-3) mm(2)s) than in the normal peripheral portion (1.95 +- 0.38 X 10(-3) mm(2)s) (P < 0.05). The mean FA values calculated in the normal peripheral (0.47 +- 0.04) and central area (0.41 +- 0.08) were very similar (P > 0.05). The mean FA values in the neoplastic lesion (0.27 +- 0.05) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the normal peripheral area and in the normal central and adenomyomatous area. DEC map showed a top-bottom type preferential direction in the peripheral but not in the central area, with the tumor lesions reducing the diffusion coding direction represented as color zones tending toward gray. Tractographic analysis permitted good delineation of the prostate anatomy (capsule outline, peripheral and central area borders) and neoplastic lesion extension and capsule infiltration compared with histopathology.; Conclusions: Three Tesla DTI of the prostate gland is feasible and has the potential for providing improved diagnostic information.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: As a result of the resolution of intravoxel fiber crossing, high-resolution fiber tractography (HRFT) provides advantages over conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for fiber tractography (FT). Nevertheless, neurosurgically applied FT is still predominantly based on DTI. Although the application of HRFT is evolving, there is still a lack of data about which method should be preferred. With this prospectively designed study, we present our initial experience comparing an analytical Q-ball imaging (QBI) approach with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and conventional DTI-FT considering a particularly neurosurgical perspective.
METHODS: For 18 patients with eloquent gliomas in the dominant hemisphere, probabilistic FT based on QBI, CSD, and DTI was performed for the major components of the language-associated pathways using a routine diffusion-weighted sequence. Quantitative analysis evaluated tract density, tract volume (TV), tract length (TL), number of fibers, and tract surface (TS) of the fiber object.; RESULTS: Both HRFT models showed a significantly larger mean TV, TL, and TS compared with DTI (for QBI vs. DTI: TV (P = 0.0000), TL (P = 0.0048), and TS (P = 0.0129); for CSD vs. DTI: TV (P = 0.0000), TL (P = 0.0008), and TS (P = 0.0010)). However, results of QBI versus CSD did not differ significantly for these variables: TV (P = 0.1415), TL (P = 0.2837), and TS (P = 0.3692). Bland-Altman analysis supports these findings, suggesting systematically higher values for TV, TL, and TS with HRFT but no relevant differences of either QBI or CSD. Neither tumor volume nor peritumoral edema influenced FT results.; CONCLUSIONS: Our quantitative analysis showed no significant differences regarding TV, TL, and TS for the HRFT methods; however, it suggested advantages over DTI-FT in terms of the display of marginal and terminal fibers. In our recently established setting, QBI-FT shows greater potential for integration into the clinical workflow.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging and promising tool to provide information about the course of white matter fiber tracts in the human brain. Based on specific acquisition schemes, diffusion tensor data resemble local fiber orientations allowing for a reconstruction of the fiber bundles. Current techniques to calculate fascicles range from simple heuristic tracking solutions to Bayesian and differential equations approaches. Most methods are based only on local diffusion information, often resulting in bending or kinking fiber paths in voxels with reduced diffusion properties. In this article we present a new tracking approach based on linear state space models encompassing an inherent smoothness criterion to avoid too wiggly tracked fiber bundles. The new technique will be described formally and tested on simulated and real data. The performance tests are focused on the pyramidal tract, where we employed a test-retest study and a group comparison in healthy subjects. Anatomical course was confirmed in a patient with selective degeneration of the pyramidal tract. The potential of the presented technique for improved neurosurgical planning is demonstrated by visualization of a tumor-induced displacement of the motor pathways. The paper closes with a thorough discussion of perspectives and limitations of the new tracking approach. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  -  In vivo white matter tractography by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become a popular tool for investigation of white matter architecture in the normal brain. Despite some unresolved issues regarding the accuracy of DTI, recent studies applied DTI for delineating white matter organization in the vicinity of brain lesions and especially brain tumors. Apart from the intrinsic limitations of DTI, the tracking of fibers in the vicinity or within lesions is further complicated due to changes in diseased tissue such as elevated water content (edema), tissue compression and degeneration. These changes deform the architecture of the white matter and in some cases prevent definite selection of the seed region of interest (ROI) from which fiber tracking begins. We show here that for displaced fiber systems, the use of anatomical approach for seed ROI selection yields insufficient results. Alternatively, we propose to select the seed points based on functional MRI activations which constrain the subjective seed ROI selection. The results are demonstrated on two major fiber systems: the pyramidal tract and the superior longitudinal fasciculus that connect critical motor and language areas, respectively. The fMRI based seed ROI selection approach enabled a more comprehensive mapping of these fiber systems. Furthermore, this procedure enabled the characterization of displaced white matter using the eigenvalue decomposition of DTI. We show that along the compressed fiber system, the diffusivity parallel to the fiber increases, while that perpendicular to the fibers decreases, leading to an overall increase in the fractional anisotropy index reflecting the compression of the fiber bundle. We conclude that definition of the functional network of a subject with deformed white matter should be done carefully. With fMRI, one can more accurately define the seed ROI for DTI based tractography and to provide a more comprehensive, functionally related, white matter mapping, a very important tool used in pre-surgical mapping.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: To date, fiber tractography (FT) is predominantly based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)-based reconstructions have become a focus of interest, enabling the resolution of intravoxel fiber crossing. However, experience with high resolution tractography (HRFT) for neurosurgical applications is still limited to a few reports. This prospectively designed feasibility study shares our initial experience using an analytical q -ball approach (QBI) for FT of language -associated pathways in comparison with DTI -FT, focussing on a quantitative analysis and evaluation of its applicability in clinical routine. METHODS: Probabilistic QBI-, and DTI -FT were performed for the major components of the language -associated fiber bundles (superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, medial/inferior longitudinal faciculus) in 11 patients with eloquent gliomas. The data was derived from a routine DWI sequence (b=1000s/mm2, 64 gradient directions). Quantitative analysis evaluated tract volume (TV), tract length (TL) and tract density (TD). Results were correlated to tumor and edema size. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis showed larger TV and TL of the overall fiber object using QBI-FT compared with DTI -FT (TV: 16.45 +/- 1.85 vs. 10.07 +/- 1.15cm3; P<0.0001; TL: 81.95 +/- 6.14 vs. 72.06 +/- 6.92 mm; P=0.0011). Regarding overall TD, DTI delivered significantly higher values (40.57 +/- 6.59 vs. 60.98 +/- 15.94 points/voxel; P=0.0118). Bland -Altman analysis illustrated a systematic advantage to yield lager TV and TL via QBI compared with DTI for all reconstructed pathways. The results were independent of tumor or edema volume . CONCLUSIONS: QBI proved to be suitable for an application in the neurosurgical setting without additional expense for the patient. Quantitative analysis of FT reveals larger overall TV, longer TL with lower TD using QBI compared with DTI, suggesting the better depiction of marginal and terminal fibers according to neuroanatomical knowledge. This emphasizes the known limitation of DTI to underestimate the dimensions of a pathway. Rather than relying on DTI, sophisticated HRFT techniques should be considered for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance in selected cases of eloquent glioma surgery.

N2  -  It has been assumed that cognitive disorder and visual-spatial disturbance in multiple system atrophy of the predominantly cerebellar type (MSA-C) are attributable to degradation of cerebellar function. The purpose of this study was to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to determine if patients with MSA-C characterized in part by visual-spatial disorders and cognitive disorders have changes of the structural connectivity network of nerve fibers, and to further describe the structural connectivity network. The study included 20 patients with MSA-C and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. A 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner was used to obtain images for DTI tractography. Image preprocessing was done by large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Whole-brain connectivity analysis was carried out. The patients had decreased numbers of long association fibers connecting the right parietal lobe to the frontal lobe. The commissural fibers and short association fibers connecting the bilateral frontal and occipital lobes and the number of short association fibers at the bilateral frontal and occipital region were also decreased significantly. The patients had a significant decrease in fiber density in the cerebellum compared to the healthy subjects. Our results provide DTI evidence suggesting that frontal and occipital white matter is involved in patients with MSA-C. This finding may correlate with their clinical symptoms such as cognitive disturbance as well as visual-spatial impairment. Therefore, cognitive disturbance and visual-spatial deficits in MSA-C might not be due to cerebellar lesions only as is widely believed but also involve cerebral lesions.

N2  -  Neuronavigation has become a useful tool in neurosurgical operating-theatres, displaying tumor outlines in the navigation-monitor (segmented preoperatively in the 3D-MRI dataset) and the operating-microscope. Furthermore, preoperatively assessed functional data can also be integrated: Functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) enable the visualization of eloquent cortical areas. MR-Spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission computed tomography (PET) and single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) demonstrate metabolic data. Fiber-tractography, today mostly based on a diffusion-weighted image data set (DTI), enables us to outline subcortical major white matter tracts, for example the corticospinal tract or the speech-associated tracts. A combination of these methods is today known as multimodal imaging.
Multimodal imaging contributes to maximum resection of intracerebral lesions such as malignant gliomas without an aggravation of postoperative morbidity, especially in combination with intraoperative MRI to overcome the problem of the so called "brain-shift".

N2  -  The objective was to study fibre orientation in the cerebral white matter of a patient with a brain tumour using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
A patient with a mild left hemiparesis and a tumour in the right frontal lobe and 20 healthy volunteers were scanned with a DTI sequence. The scans were spatially normalised and the fibre orientation in the patient compared with the fibre orientation in normal controls.; DTI disclosed a change of the orientation of fibres in the patient compared with normal controls. In the normal appearing white matter adjacent to the tumour fibres deviated from the normal superior inferior orientation in the corona radiata by about 30 degrees. This finding was consistent with a displacement by distant mass effect rather than a destruction of fibres, in agreement with the neurological examination.; In conclusion, DTI demonstrated deviation of fibres in normal appearing white matter adjacent to a tumour. The technique will improve understanding of the effects of structural abnormalities on fibres. This will assist the interpretation of clinical findings and functional imaging studies and guide neurosurgical interventions.

N2  -  Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising non-invasive tool for modulating the brain activity. Despite the widespread therapeutic and diagnostic use of TMS in neurology and psychiatry, its observed response remains hard to predict, limiting its further development and applications. Although the stimulation intensity is always maximum at the cortical surface near the coil, experiments reveal that TMS can affect deeper brain regions as well. Approach. The explanation of this spread might be found in the white matter fiber tracts, connecting cortical and subcortical structures. When applying an electric field on neurons, their membrane potential is altered. If this change is significant, more likely near the TMS coil, action potentials might be initiated and propagated along the fiber tracts towards deeper regions. In order to understand and apply TMS more effectively, it is important to capture and account for this interaction as accurately as possible. Therefore, we compute, next to the induced electric fields in the brain, the spatial distribution of the membrane potentials along the fiber tracts and its temporal dynamics. Main results. This paper introduces a computational TMS model in which electromagnetism and neurophysiology are combined. Realistic geometry and tissue anisotropy are included using magnetic resonance imaging and targeted white matter fiber tracts are traced using tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging. The position and orientation of the coil can directly be retrieved from the neuronavigation system. Incorporating these features warrants both patient- and case-specific results. Significance. The presented model gives insight in the activity propagation through the brain and can therefore explain the observed clinical responses to TMS and their inter- and/or intra-subject variability. We aspire to advance towards an accurate, flexible and personalized TMS model that helps to understand stimulation in the connected brain and to target more focused and deeper brain regions.

N2  -  Background: Surgical resection of brainstem lesions has a high risk of morbidity, because vital fasciculi in the brainstem can be damaged along the entry routes. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an in vivo method for mapping white matter fiber tracts in the brain. Objective: To summarize the experience of surgical treatment of brainstem lesions with the assistance of DTI and fiber tractography. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis clinical data of nine patients with brainstem lesions were investigated between July 2007 and September 2009. The analysis included age distribution, clinical presentation, pre- and postoperative modified Rankin score (mRS), and surgical approach. DTI and fiber tractography were used to reconstruct the corticospinal tracts and the medial lemnisci. Results: DTI and fiber tractography showed that most of the corticospinal tracts were compressed anteriorly or anterolaterally, except for one case (posteriorly). All the medial lemnisci were displaced posteriorly or posterolaterally. Individualized surgical approaches were designed according to the information provided by DTI and fiber tractography. Total resection was achieved in two patients with brainstem cavernomas and two patients with pilocytic astrocytoma. Partial resection was performed in the other patients. The neurological functional status was better than preoperative period in eight patients, one patient with medulla oblongata astrocytoma deteriorated. The preoperative average mRS score was 2.22 points. At the time of the last follow-up, the average postoperative score had improved by 0.56 to 1.66 points. Conclusions: DTI and fiber tractography can provide valuable information regarding the relationship between the principal fiber tracts and brainstem lesions, which is useful in neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  The need to improve surgical efficacy in patients affected by high-grade gliomas has led to development of advanced pre-surgical MRI-based techniques such as tractography. This study investigates pre-surgical planning of optic radiations (ORs) in patients affected by occipito-temporo-parietal high-grade gliomas, by means of constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography.
Twelve patients with occipito-temporo-parietal high-grade gliomas were recruited and analyzed using a 3 T MRI scanner. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was conducted with 64 gradient diffusion directions. OR alterations were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate the effectiveness of CSD- and DTI-based pre-surgical planning.; CSD-based tractography provided better qualitative evaluation of affected white matter tracts when compared to DTI; by thresholding tractographic probabilistic maps coming from all reconstructions, we detected, at the highest cutoff level, OR involvement in 75 % of patients (vs 41.67 % of patients with probabilistic DTI). Quantitative analysis of diffusion parameters revealed a statistically significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the affected side following CSD-based reconstructions; on the contrary, DTI-based reconstructions did not show any significant quantitative alteration.; Our results showed improvement in pre-surgical planning of high-grade gliomas involving ORs with use of CSD-based tractography. This technique provided more useful information regarding the white matter spatial relationship with brain neoplasm and its involvement in the glioma, when compared to DTI. Using CSD model for OR evaluation may optimize safe surgical resection margins, helping to reduce risk of post-operative visual deficits.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The most frequently used method for fiber tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is associated with restrictions in the resolution of crossing or kissing fibers and in the vicinity of tumor or edema. Tractography based on high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is capable of overcoming this restriction. With compressed sensing (CS) techniques, HARDI acquisitions with a smaller number of directional measurements can be used, thus enabling the use of HARDI-based fiber tractography in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether HARDI+CS-based fiber tractography improves the display of neuroanatomically complex pathways and in areas of disturbed diffusion properties.; METHODS: Six patients with gliomas in the vicinity of language-related areas underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging including a diffusion-weighted data set with 30 gradient directions. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging for cortical language sites was obtained. Fiber tractography was performed with deterministic streamline algorithms based on DTI using 3 different software platforms. Additionally, tractography based on reconstructed diffusion signals using HARDI+CS was performed.; RESULTS: HARDI+CS-based tractography displayed more compact fiber bundles compared with the DTI-based results in all cases. In 3 cases, neuroanatomically plausible fiber bundles were displayed in the vicinity of tumor and peritumoral edema, which could not be traced on the basis of DTI. The curvature around the sylvian fissure was displayed properly in 6 cases and in only 2 cases with DTI-based tractography.; CONCLUSION: HARDI+CS seems to be a promising approach for fiber tractography in clinical practice for neuroanatomically complex fiber pathways and in areas of disturbed diffusion, overcoming the problem of long acquisition times.

N2  -  Background Navigated brain stimulation (NBS) is a newly evolving technique. In addition to its supposed purpose, e. g., preoperative mapping of the central region, little is known about its further use in neurosurgery. We evaluated the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI-FT) based on NBS compared to conventional characterization of the seed region.
Methods We examined 30 patients with tumors in or close to the corticospinal tract (CST) using NBS with the Nexstim eXimia system. NBS was performed for motor cortex mapping, and DTI-FT was performed by three different clinicians using BrainLAB iPlan (R) Cranial 3.0.1 at two time points. Number of fibers, tract volume, aberrant tracts, and proximity to the tumor were compared between the two methods.; Results We recognized a higher number of fibers (1,298 +- 1,279 vs. 916 +- 986 fibers; p<0.01), tract volume (23.0 +- 15.3 vs. 18.3 +- 14.0 cm(3); p<0.01), and aberrant tracts (0.6 +- 0.5 vs. 0.3 +- 0.5 aberrant tractstracked CST; p<0.001) when the seed region was defined conventionally, while proximity of the tracts to the tumor did not differ. While NBS-based DTI-FT is independent of the planning clinician, conventional outlining of the seed region shows generally higher variability between investigators.; Conclusions Conventional DTI-FT showed significant differences between the two modalities, most likely because of the more specific definition of the seed region when DTI-FT is based on NBS. Moreover, NBS-aided DTI fiber tracking is user-independent and, therefore, a method for further standardization of DTI fiber tracking.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is increasingly used in presurgical mapping in tumors located in eloquent areas since it is the only non invasive technique that permits in vivo dissection of white matter tracts. Concordance between the DTI tracts and subcortical electrical intraoperative mapping is high, and DTI tractography has proven useful to guide surgery. However, it presents limitations due to the technique and the tumor, which must be known before using the images in the operative room. This review focuses on the possibilities and limits of DTI imaging in intraoperative tumoral mapping and presents an overview of current knowledge.

N2  -  Localization of brain function is a fundamental requisite for the resection of eloquent-area brain tumors. Preoperative functional neuroimaging and diffusion tensor imaging can display cortical functional organization and subcortical anatomy of major white matter bundles. Direct cortical and subcortical stimulation is widely used in routine practice, however, because of its ability to reveal tissue function in eloquent regions. The role and integration of these techniques is still a matter of debate. The objective of this study was to assess surgical and functional neurological outputs of awake surgery and intraoperative cortical and subcortical electrical stimulation (CSES) and to use CSES to examine the reliability of preoperative functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI-FT) for surgical planning.
We prospectively studied 27 patients with eloquent-area tumors who were selected to undergo awake surgery and direct brain mapping. All subjects underwent preoperative sensorimotor and language fMRI and DTI tractography of major white matter bundles. Intra- and postoperative complications, stimulation effects, extent of resection, and neurological outcome were determined. We topographically correlated intraoperatively identified sites (cortical and subcortical) with areas of fMRI activation and DTI tractography.; Total plus subtotal resection reached 88.8%. Twenty-one patients (77.7%) suffered transient postoperative worsening, but at 6 months follow-up only three (11.1%) patients had persistent neurological impairment. Sensorimotor cortex direct mapping correlated 92.3% with fMRI activation, while direct mapping of language cortex correlated 42.8%. DTI fiber tracking underestimated the presence of functional fibers surrounding or inside the tumor.; Preoperative brain mapping is useful when planning awake surgery to estimate the relationship between the tumor and functional brain regions. However, these techniques cannot directly lead the surgeon during resection. Intraoperative brain mapping is necessary for safe and maximal resection and to guarantee a satisfying neurological outcome. This multimodal approach is more aggressive, leads to better outcomes, and should be used routinely for resection of lesions in eloquent brain regions.

N2  -  Object. Diffusion-based MRI tractography is an imaging tool increasingly used in neurosurgical procedures to generate 3D maps of white matter pathways as an aid to identifying safe margins of resection. The majority of white matter fiber tractography software packages currently available to clinicians rely on a fundamentally flawed framework to generate fiber orientations from diffusion-weighted data, namely diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This work provides the first extensive and systematic exploration of the practical limitations of DTI-based tractography and investigates whether the higher-order tractography model constrained spherical deconvolution provides a reasonable solution to these problems within a clinically feasible timeframe.
Methods. Comparison of tractography methodologies in visualizing the corticospinal tracts was made using the diffusion-weighted data sets from 45 healthy controls and 10 patients undergoing presurgical imaging assessment. Tensor-based and constrained spherical deconvolution based tractography methodologies were applied to both patients and controls.; Results. Diffusion tensor imaging based tractography methods (using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms) substantially underestimated the extent of tracks connecting to the sensorimotor cortex in all participants in the control group. In contrast, the constrained spherical deconvolution tractography method consistently produced the biologically expected fan-shaped configuration of tracks. In the clinical cases, in which tractography was performed to visualize the corticospinal pathways in patients with concomitant risk of neurological deficit following neurosurgical resection, the constrained spherical deconvolution based and tensor-based tractography methodologies indicated very different apparent safe margins of resection; the constrained spherical deconvolution based method identified corticospinal tracts extending to the entire sensorimotor cortex, while the tensor-based method only identified a narrow subset of tracts extending medially to the vertex.; Conclusions. This comprehensive study shows that the most widely used clinical tractography method (diffusion tensor imaging based tractography) results in systematically unreliable and clinically misleading information. The higher-order tractography model, using the same diffusion-weighted data, clearly demonstrates fiber tracts more accurately, providing improved estimates of safety margins that may be useful in neurosurgical procedures. We therefore need to move beyond the diffusion tensor framework if we are to begin to provide neurosurgeons with biologically reliable tractography information.

N2  -  Knowledge about integrity and location of fibre tracts arising from eloquent cortical areas is important to plan neurosurgical interventions and to allow maximization of resection of pathological tissue while preserving vital white matter tracts. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is so far the only method to get preoperatively an impression of the individual complexity of nerve bundles. Thereby nerve fibres are not mapped directly. They are derived indirectly by analysis of the directional distribution of diffusion of water molecules which is influenced mainly by large fibre tracts. From acquisition to reconstruction and visualisation of the fibre tracts many representational stages and working steps have to be passed. Exact knowledge about problems of Diffusion Imaging is important for interpretation of the results. Particularly, brain tumor edema, intraoperative brain shift, MR-artefacts and limitations of the mathematical models and algorithms challenge DTI-developers and applicants.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DTI is being increasingly used to visualize critical white matter tracts adjacent to brain tumors before neurosurgical resection. However, brain tumors, particularly high-grade gliomas, are typically surrounded by regions of FLAIR hyperintensity that include edema, which increase isotropic diffusion, degrading the ability of standard DTI to uncover orientation estimates within these regions. We introduce a new technique, RSI, which overcomes this limitation by removing the spherical, fast diffusion component introduced by edema, providing better analysis of white matter architecture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 patients with high-grade gliomas surrounded by FLAIR-HI that at least partially resolved on follow-up imaging were included. All patients underwent RSI and DTI at baseline (FLAIR-HI present) and at follow-up (FLAIR-HI partially resolved). FA values obtained with RSI and DTI were compared within regions of FLAIR-HI and NAWM at both time points.; RESULTS: RSI showed higher FA in regions of FLAIR-HI and NAWM relative to DTI, reflecting the ability of RSI to specifically measure the slow, restricted volume fraction in regions of edema and NAWM. Furthermore, a method by time interaction revealed that FA estimates increased when the FLAIR-HI resolved by use of standard DTI but remained stable with RSI. Tractography performed within the region of FLAIR-HI revealed the superior ability of RSI to track fibers through severe edema relative to standard DTI.; CONCLUSIONS: RSI improves the quantification and visualization of white matter tracts in regions of peritumoral FLAIR-HI associated with edema relative to standard DTI and may provide a valuable tool for neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the implementation of white matter (WM) fiber tractography by diffusion tensor imaging in presurgical planning for supratentorial tumors proximal to eloquent WM tracts can alter a neurosurgeon's operative strategy.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with supratentorial brain tumors within eloquent WM tracts who underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography as part of their preoperative assessment. These patients were classified into 3 different DTI groups per the radiology reports: group 1, intact WM tracts; group 2, deviated andor displaced WM bundles; and group 3, patients with an established WM injury (interrupted andor destroyed tracts). A blinded prospective behavioral study followed, in which 4 neurosurgeons reviewed the preoperative images at 2 different times (magnetic resonance imaging without DTI, followed by a review of the DTI). They provided estimations about the DTI group of each individual eloquent WM category in every patient, and their planned surgical approach.; RESULTS: Fifteen patients (mean age, 58.3 years) were included in the study. The neurosurgeons provided a correct DTI group estimation in 53%, 60%, and 57% of the cases that involved motorsensory pathway tracts, optic tracts, and language tracts, respectively. The neurosurgeons underestimated DTI group 3 in the motor category and in the optic category 75% of the time. DTI did not alter the planned surgical approach.; CONCLUSIONS: DTI WM tractography helped neurosurgeons to correctly identify patients with interrupted motor and optic pathway tracts so they could be more aggressive with the extent of tumor resection, despite its inability to alter the operative approach.

N2  -  Object. The aim of this paper was to validate the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model for delineation of the corticospinal tract using cortical and subcortical white matter electrical stimulation for the location of functional motor pathways.
Methods. The authors compare probabilistic versus deterministic DTI fiber tracking by reconstructing the pyramidal fiber tracts on preoperatively acquired DTI in patients with brain tumors. They determined the accuracy and precision of these 2 methods using subcortical stimulation points and the sensitivity using cortical stimulation points. The authors further explored the reliability of these methods by estimation of the potential that the found connections were due to a random chance using a novel neighborhood permutation method.; Results. The probabilistic tracking method delineated tracts that were significantly closer to the stimulation points and was more sensitive than deterministic DTI fiber tracking to define the tracts directed to the motor sites. However, both techniques demonstrated poor sensitivity to finding lateral motor regions.; Conclusions. This study highlights the importance of the validation and quantification of preoperative fiber tracking with the aid of electrophysiological data during the surgery. The poor sensitivity of DTI to delineate lateral motor pathways reported herein suggests that DTI fiber tracking must be used with caution and only as adjunctive data to established methods for motor mapping.

N2  -  Treatment of intracranial tumors near the corticospinal tract remains a surgical challenge. Several technical tools to map and monitor the motor tract have been implemented. The present study aimed to assess the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking in the surgical treatment of motor eloquent tumors at our institution.
Patients operated for intracranial tumors close to the motor tract with the use of intraoperative image guidance including DTI fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract and intraoperative motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring were analyzed. The intraoperative utility of fiber tracking data was analyzed. Furthermore, preoperative MRI scans with and without motor fiber tracking were reevaluated post hoc for tumor relation to the motor tract, estimated resectability, and best approach. Thereby, the utility of fiber tracking in surgical planning was assessed.; Nineteen patients were analyzed. The estimation of tumor localization in relation to the motor tract and of resectability was not influenced by fiber tracking in any of the cases. Only in one single case did evaluating surgeons change their surgical approach after the addition of the fiber tracking data. In all cases, fiber tracking included in image guidance did not change the intraoperative strategy, while MEP monitoring did.; DTI fiber tracking did not influence the surgical planning or the intraoperative course. However, it is still used at our institution due to its ease in acquisition and its potential impact in a larger series. Furthermore, more experience with this technique is required to lead to a technical improvement.

N2  -  The ability of diffusion tensor MRI to detect the preferential diffusion of water in cerebral white matter tracts enables neurosurgeons to noninvasively visualize the relationship of lesions to functional neural pathways. Although viewed as a research tool in its infancy, diffusion tractography has evolved into a neurosurgical tool with applications in glioma surgery that are enhanced by evolutions in crossing fiber visualization, edema correction, and automated tract identification. In this paper the current literature supporting the use of tractography in brain tumor surgery is summarized, highlighting important clinical studies on the application of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for preoperative planning of glioma resection, and risk assessment to analyze postoperative outcomes. The key methods of tractography in current practice and crucial white matter fiber bundles are summarized. After a review of the physical basis of DTI and post-DTI tractography, the authors discuss the methodologies with which to adapt DT image processing for surgical planning, as well as the potential of connectomic imaging to facilitate a network approach to oncofunctional optimization in glioma surgery.

N2  -  Objective: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on echo-planar imaging (EPI) can suffer from geometric image distortions in comparison to conventional anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, DTI-derived information, such as fiber tractography (FT) used for treatment planning of brain tumors, might be associated with spatial inaccuracies when linearly projected on anatomical MRI. Hence, a non-linear, semi-elastic image fusion shall be evaluated in this study that aims at correcting for image distortions in DTI.
Patients and methods: In a sample of 27 patient datasets, 614 anatomical landmark pairs were retrospectively defined in DTI and T1- or T2-weighted three-dimensional (3D) MRI data. The datasets were processed by a commercial software package (Elements Image Fusion .0; Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany) providing rigid and semi-elastic fusion functionalities, such as DTI distortion correction. To quantify the displacement prior to and after semi-elastic fusion, the Euclidian distances of rigidly and elastically fused landmarks were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics and Bland-Altman plot.; Results: For rigid and semi-elastic fusion mean target registration errors of 3.03 +- 2.29 mm and 2.04 +- 1.95 mm were found, respectively, with 91% of the evaluated landmarks moving closer to their position determined in T1- or T2-weighted 3D MRI data after distortion correction. Most efficient correction was achieved for non-superficial landmarks showing distortions up to 1 cm.; Conclusion: This study indicates that semi-elastic image fusion can be used for retrospective distortion correction of DTI data acquired for image guidance, such as DTI FT as used for a broad range of clinical indications.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly used in the resection of both high-and low-grade gliomas. Whereas conventional MRI techniques provide only anatomical information, DTI offers data on CNS connectivity by enabling visualization of important white matter tracts in the brain. Importantly, DTI allows neurosurgeons to better guide their surgical approach and resection. Here, the authors review basic scientific principles of DTI, include a primer on the technology and image acquisition, and outline the modality's evolution as a frequently used tool for glioma resection. Current literature supporting its use is summarized, highlighting important clinical studies on the application of DTI in preoperative planning for glioma resection, preoperative diagnosis, and postoperative outcomes.

N2  -  Some specially imaging of magnetic resonance imaging, the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy (FA), are useful to described, detect, and map the extent of spinal cord lesions. FA measurements may are used to predicting the outcome of patients who have spinal cord lesions. Fiber tracking enable to visualizing the integrity of white matter tracts surrounding some lesions, and this information could be used to formulating a differential diagnosis and planning biopsies or resection. In this article, we will describe the current uses for DWI and fiber tracking and speculate on others in which we believe these techniques will be useful in the future.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to create a white matter atlas of the human brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and to describe the constant and variable features of the major pathways. DTI was acquired from 40 healthy right-handed adults and reconstructed tracts mapped within a common reference space (MNI). Group effect maps of each tract defined constant anatomical features while overlap maps were generated to study inter-subject variability and to compare DTI derived anatomy with a histological atlas. Two patients were studied to assess the localizing validity of the atlas. The DTI-derived maps are overall consistent with a previously published histological atlas. A statistically significant leftward asymmetry was found for the volume and number of streamlines of the cortico-spinal tract and the direct connections between Broca's and Wernicke's territories (long segment). A statistically significant rightward asymmetry was found for the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the fronto-parietal connections (anterior segment) of the arcuate fasciculus. Furthermore, males showed a left lateralization of the fronto-temporal segment of the arcuate fasciculus (long segment), while females had a more bilateral distribution. In two patients with brain lesions, DTI was acquired and tractography used to show that the tracts affected by the lesions were correctly identified by the atlas. This study suggests that DTI-derived maps can be used together with a previous histological atlas to establish the relationship of focal lesions with nearby tracts and improve clinico-anatomical correlation.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW

N2  -  Historically, brain tumour resection has relied upon standardised anatomical atlases and classical mapping techniques for successful resection. While these have provided adequate results in the past, the emergence of new technologies has heralded a wave of less invasive, patient-specific techniques for the mapping of brain function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and, more recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are two such techniques. While fMRI is able to highlight localisation of function within the cortex, DTI represents the only technique able to elucidate white matter structures in vivo. Used in conjunction, both of these techniques provide important presurgical information for thorough preoperative planning, as well as intraoperatively via integration into frameless stereotactic neuronavigational systems. Together, these techniques show great promise for improved neurosurgical outcomes. While further research is required for more widespread clinical validity and acceptance, results from the literature provide a clear road map for future research and development to cement these techniques into the clinical setup of neurosurgical departments globally.

N2  -  Background: DTI-based tractography is an increasingly important tool for planning brain surgery in patients suffering from brain tumours. However, there is an ongoing debate which tracking approaches yield the most valid results. Especially the use of functional localizer data such as navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) seem to improve fibre tracking data in conditions where anatomical landmarks are less informative due to tumour-induced distortions of the gyral anatomy. We here compared which of the two localizer techniques yields more plausible results with respect to mapping different functional portions of the corticospinal tract (CST) in brain tumour patients.
Methods: The CSTs of 18 patients with intracranial tumours in the vicinity of the primary motor area (M1) were investigated by means of deterministic DTI. The core zone of the tumour-adjacent hand, foot andor tongue M1 representation served as cortical regions of interest (ROIs). M1 core zones were defined by both the nTMS hotspots and the fMRI local activation maxima. In addition, for all patients, a subcortical ROI at the level of the inferior anterior pons was implemented into the tracking algorithm in order to improve the anatomical specificity of CST reconstructions. As intra-individual control, we additionally tracked the CST of the hand motor region of the unaffected, i.e., non-lesional hemisphere, again comparing fMRI and nTMS M1 seeds. The plausibility of the fMRI-ROI- vs. nTMS-ROI-based fibre trajectories was assessed by a-priori defined anatomical criteria. Moreover, the anatomical relationship of different fibre courses was compared regarding their distribution in the anterior-posterior direction as well as their location within the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC).; Results: Overall, higher plausibility rates were observed for the use of nTMS-as compared to fMRI-defined cortical ROIs (p < 0.05) in tumour vicinity. On the non-lesional hemisphere, however, equally good plausibility rates (100%) were observed for both localizer techniques. fMRI-originated fibres generally followed a more posterior course relative to the nTMS-based tracts (p < 0.01) in both the lesional and non-lesional hemisphere.; Conclusion: NTMS achieved better tracking results than fMRI in conditions when the cortical tract origin (M1) was located in close vicinity to a brain tumour, probably influencing neurovascular coupling. Hence, especially in situations with altered BOLD signal physiology, nTMS seems to be the method of choice in order to identify seed regions for CST mapping in patients. (C) 2016 The Authors.

N2  -  Cerebral neoplasms like gliomas may cause intracranial pressure increasing, neural tract deviation, infiltration, or destruction in peritumoral areas, leading to neuro-functional deficits. Novel tracking technology, such as DTI, can objectively reveal and visualize three-dimensional white matter trajectories; in combination with intraoperative navigation, it can help achieve maximum resection whilst minimizing neurological deficit. Since the reconstruction of DTI raw data largely relies on the technical engineering and anatomical experience of the operator; it is time-consuming and prone to operator-induced bias. Here, we develop new user-friendly software to automatically segment and reconstruct functionally active areas to facilitate precise surgery. In this pilot trial, we used an in-house developed software (DiffusionGo) specially designed for neurosurgeons, which integrated a reliable diffusion-weighted image (DWI) preprocessing pipeline that embedded several functionalities from software packages of FSL, MRtrix3, and ANTs. The preprocessing pipeline is as follows: 1. DWI denoising, 2. Gibbs-ringing removing, 3. Susceptibility distortion correction (process if opposite polarity data were acquired), 4. Eddy current and motion correction, and 5. Bias correction. Then, this fully automatic multiple assigned criteria algorithms for fiber tracking were used to achieve easy modeling and assist precision surgery. We demonstrated the application with three language-related cases in three different centers, including a left frontal, a left temporal, and a left frontal-temporal glioma, to achieve a favorable surgical outcome with language function preservation or recovery. The DTI tracking result using DiffusionGo showed robust consistency with direct cortical stimulation (DCS) finding. We believe that this fully automatic processing pipeline provides the neurosurgeon with a solution that may reduce time costs and operating errors and improve care quality and surgical procedure quality across different neurosurgical centers.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have dynamically entered the presurgical evaluation context of brain surgery during the past decades, providing novel perspectives in surgical planning and lesion access approaches. However, their application in the presurgical setting requires significant time and effort and increased costs, thereby raising questions regarding efficiency and best use. In this work, we set out to evaluate DTI-tractography and combined fMRI/DTI-tractography during intra-operative neuronavigation in resective brain surgery using lesion-related preoperative neurological deficit (PND) outcomes as metrics. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 252 consecutive patients admitted for brain surgery. Standard anatomical neuroimaging protocols were performed in 127 patients, 69 patients had additional DTI-tractography, and 56 had combined DTI-tractography/fMRI. fMRI procedures involved language, motor, somatic sensory, sensorimotor and visual mapping. DTI-tractography involved fiber tracking of the motor, sensory, language and visual pathways. At 1 month postoperatively, DTI-tractography patients were more likely to present either improvement or preservation of PNDs (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively). At 6 months, combined DTI-tractography/fMRI patients were more likely to experience complete PND resolution (p < 0.001). Low-grade lesion patients (N = 102) with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely to experience complete resolution of PNDs at 1 and 6 months (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). High-grade lesion patients (N = 140) with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI were more likely to have PNDs resolved at 6 months (p = 0.005). Patients with motor symptoms (N = 80) were more likely to experience complete remission of PNDs at 6 months with DTI-tractography or combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004, respectively), without significant difference between the two imaging protocols (p = 1). Patients with sensory symptoms (N = 44) were more likely to experience complete PND remission at 6 months with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI (p = 0.004). The intraoperative neuroimaging modality did not have a significant effect in patients with preoperative seizures (N = 47). Lack of PND worsening was observed at 6 month follow-up in patients with combined DTI-tractography/fMRI. Our results strongly support the combined use of DTI-tractography and fMRI in patients undergoing resective brain surgery for improving their postoperative clinical profile.

N2  -  Introduction. For gliomas, the goal of surgery is maximal tumour removal with the preservation of neurological function. We evaluated the contribution of the combination of diffusion tensor imaging-based fibre tracking (DTI-FT) of the pyramidal tract (PT) integrated to the navigation and subcortical direct electrical stimulations (DESs) to surgical outcomes. Method. Ten patients underwent surgery for gliomas located in close relationship with the subcortical course of the PT. Preoperative DTI was performed with a three-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner applying an echo-planar sequence with 20 diffusion directions. DTI-FT data were systematically loaded into the navigation for intraoperative guidance. When the resection closely approached the PT as illustrated on navigation images, subcortical DESs were used to confirm the proximity of the PT by observing motor responses. The location of all subcortically stimulated points with positive motor response was correlated with the illustrated PT. Motor deficits were evaluated pre- and postoperatively, and compared with the extent of tumour removal. Results. DTI-FT of the PT was successfully performed in all patients. A total of fifteen positive subcortical DESs were obtained in 8 of 10 patients; in these cases, the mean distance from the stimulated point to the PT was 6.2 +/- 3.6 mm. The mean tumoural volumetric resection was 90.8 +/- 10.4%, with a gross total resection in four patients. At one month after surgery, only one patient had a slight impairment of motor function (decreased fine motor hand skills). Conclusions. DTI-FT is an accurate technique to map the PT in the vicinity of brain tumours. By combining anatomical (DTI-FT) and functional (subcortical DES) studies for intraoperative localization of the PT, the authors achieved a good volumetric resection of tumours located in eloquent motor areas, with low morbidity. Careful use of this protocol requires the knowledge of some pitfalls, mainly the occurrence of brain shift during removal of large tumours.

N2  -  Glioma is one of the most challenging types of brain tumors to treat or control locally. One of the main problems is to determine which areas of the apparently normal brain contain glioma cells, as gliomas are known to infiltrate several centimeters beyond the clinically apparent lesion that is visualized on standard Computed Tomography scans (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs). To ensure that radiation treatment encompasses the whole tumor, including the cancerous cells not revealed by MRI, doctors treat the volume of brain that extends 2 cm out from the margin of the visible tumor. This approach does not consider varying tumor-growth dynamics in different brain tissues, thus it may result in killing some healthy cells while leaving cancerous cells alive in the other areas. These cells may cause recurrence of the tumor later in time, which limits the effectiveness of the therapy.
Knowing that glioma cells preferentially spread along nerve fibers, we propose the use of a geodesic distance on the Riemannian manifold of brain diffusion tensors to replace the Euclidean distance used in the clinical practice and to correctly identify the tumor invasion margin. This mathematical model results in a first-order Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that can be numerically solved in a stable and consistent way. To compute the geodesic distance, we use actual Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data from 11 patients with glioma and compare our predicted infiltration distance map with actual grwoth in follow-up MRI scans. Results show improvement in predicting the invasion margin when using the geodesic distance as opposed to the 2 cm conventional Euclidean distance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance with diffusion tensor image (DTI) may be able to estimate trajectories compatible with subcortical tracts close to brain lesions. A limit of DTI is brain shifting (movement of the brain after dural opening and tumor resection).
OBJECTIVE: To calculate the brain shift of trajectories compatible with the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients undergoing glioma resection and predict the shift directions of CST.; METHODS: DTI was acquired in 20 patients and carried out through 12 noncollinear directions. Dedicated software "merged" all sequences acquired with tractographic processing and the whole dataset was sent to the neuronavigation system. Preoperative, after dural opening (in 11) and tumor resection (in all) DTI acquisitions were performed to evaluate CST shifting. The extent of shifting was considered as the maximum distance between the preoperative and intraoperative contours of the trajectories.; RESULTS: An outward shift of CST was observed in 8 patients and an inward shift in 10 patients during surgery. In the remaining 2 patients, no intraoperative displacement was detected. Only peritumoral edema showed a statistically significant correlation with the amount of shift. In those patients in which DTI was acquired after dural opening as well (11 patients), an outward shifting of CST was evident in that phase.; CONCLUSION: The use of intraoperative DTI demonstrated brain shifting of the CST. DTI evaluation of white matter tracts can be used during surgical procedures only if updated with intraoperative acquisitions.

N2  -  Repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used for preoperative language mapping, but it still suffers from comparatively high sensitivity and low specificity when compared to direct cortical stimulation (DCS). Therefore, this study evaluates whether the additional consideration of rTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for identifying language-positive brain regions improves specificity when compared to DCS.
We performed rTMS, rTMS-based DTI FT, and DCS during awake surgery combined with object naming in 20 patients suffering from left-sided perisylvian brain lesions. For rTMS, different error rate thresholds (ERTs) and error types were considered, and DTI FT was conducted with individualized fractional anisotropy thresholds (FATs). Then, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for rTMS vs. DCS, rTMS-based DTI FT vs. DCS, and rTMS spots confirmed by rTMS-based DTI FT vs. DCS were calculated.; In general, rTMS vs. DCS was in good accordance with previous literature (sensitivityspecificity: 92.713.3 % for all naming errors without ERT). In addition, rTMS-based DTI FT vs. DCS led to balanced results when tracking was based on all errors as well (sensitivityspecificity: 62.864.3 % for 100 % FAT). However, rTMS combined with rTMS-based DTI FT vs. DCS did not lead to any improvement in specificity when compared to rTMS vs. DCS alone.; The additional use of rTMS-based DTI FT to rTMS did not improve the identification of DCS-positive language areas during awake surgery. Yet, concerning rTMS-based DTI FT, this new technique must be validated itself by intraoperative subcortical stimulation.

N2  -  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) represents a recent development that extends imaging from the depiction of the neuroanatomy into the field of functional and physiologic processes. DWI measures a fundamentally different physiologic parameter than conventional MRI. Image contrast is related to differences in the microscopic motion (diffusion) of water molecules within brain tissue rather than a change in total tissue water. Consequently, DWI can reveal pathology where conventional T1- and T2-weighted MR images are negative. DWI has clinically proven its value in the assessment of acute cerebral stroke and trauma by showing cerebral injury early due to ist ability to discriminate between lesions with cytotoxic edema (decreased diffusion) from lesions with vasogenic edema (increased diffusion). Full tensor DWI allows to calculate a variety of functional maps, the most widely used maps include maps of apparent diffusion coefficients and isotropic diffusion. In addition maps of anisotropic diffusion can be calculated which are believed to give information about the integrity and location of fiber tracts. This functional-anatomical information will most probably play an increasingly important role in the early detection of primary and secondary tissue injury from various reasons and could guide and validate current and future neuroprotective treatments.

N2  -  Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging-derived tractography (DTI-t) contribute to the localization of language areas, but their accuracy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of preoperative fMRI and DTI-t obtained with a simultaneous multi-slice technique using intraoperative direct cortical stimulation (DCS) or corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) as reference standards.
Materials and Methods: This prospective study included 26 patients (23-74 years; male:female, 13:13) with tumors in the vicinity of Broca's area who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI-t. A site-by-site comparison between preoperative (fMRI and DTI-t) and intraoperative language mapping (DCS or CCEP) was performed for 226 cortical sites to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI and DTI-t for mapping Broca's areas. For sites with positive signals on fMRI or DTI-t, the true-positive rate (TPR) was calculated based on the concordance and discordance between fMRI and DTI-t.; Results: Among 226 cortical sites, DCS was performed in 100 sites and CCEP was performed in 166 sites. The specificities of fMRI and DTI-t ranged from 72.4% (6387) to 96.8% (122126), respectively. The sensitivities of fMRI (except for verb generation) and DTI-t were 69.2% (913) to 92.3% (1213) with DCS as the reference standard, and 40.0% (1640) or lower with CCEP as the reference standard. For sites with preoperative fMRI or DTI-t positivity (n = 82), the TPR was high when fMRI and DTI-t were concordant (81.2% and 100% using DCS and CCEP, respectively, as the reference standards) and low when fMRI and DTI-t were discordant (<= 24.2%).; Conclusion: fMRI and DTI-t are sensitive and specific for mapping Broca's area compared with DCS and specific but insensitive compared with CCEP. A site with a positive signal on both fMRI and DTI-t represents a high probability of being an essential language area.

N2  -  Fiber tracking allows the in vivo reconstruction of human brain white matter fiber trajectories based on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI), but its application in the clinical routine is still in its infancy. In this study, we present a new software for fiber tracking, developed on top of a general-purpose DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) framework, which can be easily integrated into existing picture archiving and communication system (PACS) of radiological institutions. Images combining anatomical information and the localization of different fiber tract trajectories can be encoded and exported in DICOM and Analyze formats, which are valuable resources in the clinical applications of this method. Fiber tracking was implemented based on existing line propagation algorithms, but it includes a heuristic for fiber crossings in the case of disk-shaped diffusion tensors. We successfully performed fiber tracking on MR-DTI data sets from 26 patients with different types of brain lesions affecting the corticospinal tracts. In all cases, the trajectories of the central spinal tract (pyramidal tract) were reconstructed and could be applied at the planning phase of the surgery as well as in intraoperative neuronavigation.

N2  -  Background and study object: We describe the case of a young patient treated for a ganglioglioma of the right lateral ventricle. The ganglioma was approached via a temporal route using neuronavigation. Such lesions, if confined to the ventricular system and, especially, to the lateral ventricle, are unusual.
Case Report: A 22-year-old male was admitted because of headache and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a neoplasm in the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. A CT scan demonstrated calcifications. After pre-operative planning, the patient was scheduled for neuronavigated operation. A small temporal craniotomy was performed. Once the dura was opened, we acquired a volumetric intraoperative MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The optic tract was visualized again on intraoperative DTI and the volumetric MRI was used to update the navigational data.; Results: The temporal corticotomy between the inferior and the middle temporal gyrus was guided by neuronavigation, keeping the surgical corridor in distance to the optic tract until the tumor was reached. After tumor resection, we repeated intraoperative MRI with DTI, which confirmed complete tumor removal and the patency of the optic pathway. Our protocol allowed us to reach the lesion via a minimally invasive approach with near real-time control of the integrity of the optic tract during surgery. DTI was acquired preoperatively and during surgery, avoiding inaccuracy due to brain shift.; Conclusions: Intraoperative MRI with DTI allows to treat such lesions via minimally invasive approaches and to reduce operative morbidity due to fiber tract damage.

N2  -  As highly invasive and infiltrative tumors, gliomas are hard to delineate from healthy brain parenchyma, even with the microscope enhanced eye of an experienced neurosurgeon. However, the surgical goal remains maximum extent of tumor volume resection with a preservation of neurological function. With functional data integrated and visualized in the navigation system, postoperative morbidity can be reduced. With the so far well established techniques diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography and functional MRI (fMRI), white matter tracts or eloquent cortical areas can be displayed. With magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and also positron emmission computed tomography (PET), methods displaying brain metabolism are also widely used. However, further technical and computational development of these methods has already shown extended insights in brain networks and pathologies and promises further reduction of postoperative morbidity, while used in navigation systems. In addition to these methods, novel techniques have already been implemented and successfully used in the clinical routine. In this way, this review summarizes recent developments in DTI, fMRI, MRSI and PET, also with their use during neurosurgical operations, but also gives introduction in novel methods like navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) or advanced diffusion models as base for fiber tracking.

N2  -  We describe the case of a child ("S") who was treated with radiation therapy at age 5 for a recurrent malignant brain tumor. Radiation successfully abolished the tumor but caused radiation-induced tissue necrosis, primarily affecting cerebral white matter. S was introduced to us at age 15 because of her profound dyslexia. We assessed cognitive abilities and performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure cerebral white matter pathways. Diffuse white matter differences were evident in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion anisotropy, and mean diffusivity measures in S compared to a group of 28 normal female controls. In addition, we found specific white matter pathway deficits by comparing tensor-orientation directions in S's brain with those of the control brains. While her principal diffusion direction maps appeared consistent with those of controls over most of the brain, there were tensor-orientation abnormalities in the fiber tracts that form the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in both hemispheres. Tractography analysis indicated that the left and right arcuate fasciculus (AF), as well as other tracts within the SLF, were missing in S. Other major white matter tracts, such as the corticospinal and inferior occipitofrontal pathways, were intact. Functional MRI measurements indicated left-hemisphere dominanance for language with a normal activation pattern. Despite the left AF abnormality, S had preserved oral language with average sentence repetition skills. In addition to profound dyslexia, S exhibited visuospatial, calculation, and rapid naming deficits and was impaired in both auditory and spatial working memory. We propose that the reading and visuospatial deficits were due to the abnormal left and right SLF pathways, respectively. These results advance our understanding of the functional significance of the SLF and are the first to link radiation necrosis with selective damage to a specific set of fiber tracts.

N2  -  Multimodal functional navigation enables removing a tumor close to eloquent brain areas with low postoperative deficits, whereas additional intraoperative imaging ensures that the maximum extent of the resection can be achieved and updates the image data compensating for the effects of brain shift. Intraoperative imaging beyond standard anatomic imaging, that is, intraoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and especially intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), add further safety for complex tumor resections. This article discusses the acquisition of intraoperative fMRI, DTI, and imaging.

N2  -  Resection of gliomas invading primary motor cortex and subcortical motor pathway is difficult in both surgical decision-making and functional outcome prediction. In this study, magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were used to perform tractography to visualize pyramidal tract (PT) along its whole length in a stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) environment. The potential value of its clinical application was evaluated.
Both three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI datasets were obtained from 45 eligible patients with suspected cerebral gliomas and then transferred to the VR system (Dextroscope; Volume Interactions Pte. Ltd., Singapore). The cortex and tumor were segmented and reconstructed via MRI, respectively, while the tractographic PTs were reconstructed via DTI. All those were presented in a stereoscopic 3-D display synchronously, for the purpose of patient-specific presurgical planning and surgical simulation in each case. The relationship between increasing amplitude of the number of effective fibers of PT (EPT) at affected sides and the patients' Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) at 6 months was addressed out.; In VR presurgical planning for gliomas, surgery was aided by stereoscopic 3-D visualizing the relative position of the PTs and a tumor. There was no significant difference between pre- and postsurgical EPT in this population. A positive relationship was proved between EPT increasing amplitude and 6-month KPS.; 3-D stereoscopic visualization of tractography in this VR environment enhances the operators to well understand the anatomic information of intra-axial tumor contours and adjacent PT, results in surgical trajectory optimization initially, and maximal safe tumor resection finally. In accordance to the EPT increasing amplitude, surgeon can predict the long-term motor functional outcome.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) are essential tools for diagnosing, differentiating, and monitoring brain tumors. High-field MRI provides higher signal-to-noise ratio, shorter scan time, and better image quality. One-stop multiparametric study, including DTI and PWI, is possible with high-field MRI in brain tumors. DTI can be used for assessing spatial relationship between major white matter tract and tumor, differentiating gliomas from nonglial tumors, and postoperative evaluation. PWI provides reliable biomarkers for glioma grading, therapeutic responses, and differential diagnosis of various brain tumors. With higher field strength, better-quality DTI and PWI can raise the diagnostic accuracy in brain tumors.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Awake surgery combined with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) and intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) is considered the gold standard for the resection of highly language-eloquent brain tumors. Different modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), are commonly added as adjuncts for preoperative language mapping but have been shown to have relevant limitations. Thus, this study presents a novel multimodal setup consisting of preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) as an adjunct to awake surgery.
METHODS Sixty consecutive patients (63.3% men, mean age 47.6 +- 13.3 years) suffering from highly language-eloquent left-hemispheric low- or high-grade glioma underwent preoperative nTMS language mapping and nTMS-based DTI FT, followed by awake surgery for tumor resection. Both nTMS language mapping and DTI FT data were available for resection planning and intraoperative guidance. Clinical outcome parameters, including craniotomy size, extent of resection (EOR), language deficits at different time points, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, duration of surgery, and inpatient stay, were assessed.; RESULTS According to postoperative evaluation, 28.3% of patients showed tumor residuals, whereas new surgery-related permanent language deficits occurred in 8.3% of patients. KPS scores remained unchanged (median preoperative score 90, median follow-up score 90).; CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to present a clinical outcome analysis of this very modern approach, which is increasingly applied in neurooncological centers worldwide. Although human language function is a highly complex and dynamic cortico-subcortical network, the presented approach offers excellent functional and oncological outcomes in patients undergoing surgery of lesions affecting this network.

N2  -  While the diagnosis of high-grade glioma (HGG) is still associated with a considerably poor prognosis, neurosurgical tumor resection provides an opportunity for prolonged survival and improved quality of life for affected patients. However, successful tumor resection is dependent on a proper surgical planning to avoid surgery-induced functional deficits whilst achieving a maximum extent of resection (EOR). With diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) providing insight into individual white matter neuroanatomy, the challenge remains to disentangle that information as correctly and as completely as possible. In particular, due to the lack of sensitivity and accuracy, the clinical value of widely used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based tractography is increasingly questioned. We evaluated whether the recently developed multi-level fiber tracking (MLFT) technique can improve tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with motor-eloquent HGGs. Forty patients with therapy-naive HGGs (mean age: 62.6 +/- 13.4 years, 57.5% males) and preoperative diffusion MRI [repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE): 5000/78 ms, voxel size: 2x2x2 mm(3), one volume at b=0 s/mm(2), 32 volumes at b=1000 s/mm(2)] underwent reconstruction of the CST of the tumor-affected and unaffected hemispheres using MLFT in addition to deterministic DTI-based and deterministic constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based fiber tractography. The brain stem was used as a seeding region, with a motor cortex mask serving as a target region for MLFT and a region of interest (ROI) for the other two algorithms. Application of the MLFT method substantially improved bundle reconstruction, leading to CST bundles with higher radial extent compared to the two other algorithms (delineation of CST fanning with a wider range; median radial extent for tumor-affected vs. unaffected hemisphere - DTI: 19.46 degrees vs. 18.99 degrees, p=0.8931; CSD: 30.54 degrees vs. 27.63 degrees, p=0.0546; MLFT: 81.17 degrees vs. 74.59 degrees, p=0.0134). In addition, reconstructions by MLFT and CSD-based tractography nearly completely included respective bundles derived from DTI-based tractography, which was however favorable for MLFT compared to CSD-based tractography (median coverage of the DTI-based CST for affected vs. unaffected hemispheres - CSD: 68.16% vs. 77.59%, p=0.0075; MLFT: 93.09% vs. 95.49%; p=0.0046). Thus, a more complete picture of the CST in patients with motor-eloquent HGGs might be achieved based on routinely acquired diffusion MRI data using MLFT.

N2  -  Purpose: To seek to distinguish and visualize the different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) growth patterns among malignant gliomas utilizing visually enhanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Materials and Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients undergoing image-guided resection of a newly diagnosed malignant glioma underwent add-on acquisition of DTI data based on an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved imaging protocol during preoperative MRI scans for routine intraoperative image guidance. Tumor growth patterns were assigned to expansive or mixedinfiltrative classes as described in the companion article (24). Infiltrating tumors were WHO Grade IV astrocytomas and all expansive tumors were either WHO Grade III astrocytomas or WHO Grade II astrocytomas. DTI-based white matter tractography was conducted and the DTI data were fused with anatomical images using an in-house software package we developed to enhance the visualization of the tumorfiber interface. In one case additional analysis was performed with 2D multivoxel H-1-MRSI utilizing a 2D chemical shift imaging (CSI) technique to corroborate the nature of this interface.; Results: Out of the 19 tumor patients studied, 11 had infiltrative tumors and the other 8 had expansive tumors. While less clear with 2D axial diffusion color maps, visually enhanced 3D reconstructions of the tumorfiber interface successfully corroborated distinctive growth patterns. This was particularly evident when viewed in 3D video loops of each tumorfiber interface.; Conclusion: We have successfully developed software that visually enhances the anatomic details of the tumorfiber interface in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas. These data support the existence of a subgroup of patients within the WHO Grade III classification with expansive tumors and a significantly better prognosis.

N2  -  Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a major cause of brain damage in infants, and is associated with periventricular white matter injury and chronic neurological dysfunctions. However, the mechanisms of the chronic white matter injury and reorganization are still unclear. In this study, in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was employed to evaluate the late changes of white matter microstructural integrity in the rat brains at 10 weeks after severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insults at postnatal day 7. In the fractional anisotropy directionality map, qualitative evaluation showed that a dorsoventrally oriented fiber bundle extended from the corpus callosum into the cyst in the anterior brain, whilst the posterior peri-infarct areas had similar fiber orientations as the contralateral internal capsule, optic tract and fimbria of hippocampus. Compared to the contralateral hemisphere, significantly higher fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and diffusion trace value were observed quantitatively in the distal end of the extended fiber bundle connecting the anterior and posterior white matters rostrocaudally. A significantly lower fractional anisotropy but higher axial and radial diffusivities and trace were also found in the ipsilateral corpus callosum, proximal external capsule and anterior commissure, while slightly lower fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were noticed in the ipsilateral internal capsule and optic nerve. It was suggested that increased fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and trace characterize white matter reorganization in chronic neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insults, whereas reduction in fractional anisotropy appears to characterize two types of white matter lesions, with significantly higher axial and radial diffusivities and trace being primary and slightly lower axial diffusivity being secondary. Combined with fractional anisotropy directionality map, in vivo DTI provides important indices to differentiate the chronic effects of severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury and recovery globally, quantitatively and non-invasively.

N2  -  AIM: We have applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to interrogate microstructural changes in white matter integrity in a widely used middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of cerebral ischemia.
MATERIAL and METHODS: We performed ex vivo DTI 35 days after 60 minutes transient focal ischemia in male spontaneously hypertensive rats and generated fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial and radial diffusivity maps. Regions of interest corresponding to external capsule (EC), corpus callosum (CC) and internal capsule (IC) were compared among sham and stroked rats. We compared tractographic projections of white matter fiber patterns and examined white matter integrity by Luxol fast blue histological analysis. We also determined infarct lesion volumes at 24 hours post-ischemia by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or at 35 days by histological staining with cresyl violet.; RESULTS: We found alterations in EC and IC, but not CC, as represented by decreased FA and increased mean, axial and radial diffusivities. The size of the ischemic lesion detected subacutely by T2-weighted MRI or at 35 days by histological staining correlated with the decline in FA in the affected structures. Tractography revealed disruption of fiber trajectories through the EC and reorientation of fibers within the caudateputamen of rats subjected to MCAO. Similarly, loss of white matter integrity in the EC and increased white matter density in the caudateputamen along the infarct border zone was evidenced by Luxol fast blue staining.; CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging therefore allows for monitoring of white matter injury and reorganization in hypertensive rats.

N2  -  Background: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides language maps in brain tumor patients. Yet, corresponding data on the visualization of language-related subcortical pathways is lacking. Therefore, this study evaluates the feasibility of nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for subcortical language pathways by a fractional anisotropy (FA) protocol.
New method: DTI FT was performed in 37 patients suffering from left-sided perisylvian brain lesions based on nTMS data exclusively, using the FA-based protocol originally established for the corticospinal tract (CST) by Frey et al. (2012): minimum fiber length was 110 mm and the highest individual FA value leading to visualization of white matter tracts was determined as the FA threshold (FAT). Then, deterministic DTI FT using an FA value of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the individual FAT (with 25% as an additional setting to the original protocol) was performed.; Results: Our approach visualized 9 language-related subcortical white matter pathways. By using 100% FAT, the mean percentage of visualized tracts was 13.5%, whereas DTI FT performed with 75%, 50%, and 25% FAT detected 30.6%, 61.3%, and 93.7% of language-related fiber tracts, respectively.; Comparison with existing methods: nTMS language mapping alone is not able to visualize subcortical language-related pathways.; Conclusions: This study shows that nTMS language maps are feasible for DTI FT of language-related pathways within the scope of a FAT-based protocol. Although this approach is novel and might be helpful during scientific neuroimaging and tumor resection, intraoperative validation is needed to go beyond the level of feasibility.

N2  -  Preoperative DTI Fiber Tracking (DTI-FT) reconstruction of functional tracts combined with intraoperative subcortical mapping (ISM) is potentially useful to improve surgical procedures in gliomas located in eloquent areas. Aims of the study are: (1) to evaluate the modifications of fiber trajectory induced by the tumor; (2) to validate preoperative DTI-FT results with intraoperative identification of functional subcortical sites through direct subcortical stimulation; (3) to evaluate the impact of preoperative DTI-FT reconstructions in a neuronavigational setup combined with ISM technique on duration and modalities of surgical procedures, and on functional outcome of the patients.
Data are available on 64 patients (52 low-grade and 12 high-grade gliomas). DTI-FT was acquired by a 3-T MR scanner with a single-shot EPI sequence (TRTE 898680 ms, b=1000 smm) with gradients applied along 32 non-collinear directions. 3D Fast Field Echo (FFE) T1-weighted imaging (TRTE 84 ms) was performed for anatomic guidance. The corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital and uncinatus fasciculi were reconstructed. Data were transferred to the neuronavigational system. Functional subcortical sites identified during ISM were correlated with fiber tracts depicted by DTI-FT.; In high-grade gliomas, DTI-FT depicted tracts mostly at the tumor periphery; in low-grade gliomas, fibers were frequently located inside the tumor mass. There was a high correlation between DTI-FT and ISM (sensitivity for CST=95%, language tracts=97%). For a proper reconstruction of the tracts, it was necessary to use a low FA threshold of fiber tracking algorithm and to position additional regions of interest (ROIs). The combination of DTI-FT and ISM decreased the duration of surgery, patient fatigue, and intraoperative seizures.; Combination of DTI-FT and ISM allows accurate identification of eloquent fiber tracts and enhances surgical performance and safety maintaining a high rate of functional preservation.

N2  -  Introduction: Diffusion MRI tractography has been increasingly used to delineate white matter pathways in vivo for which the leading clinical application is presurgical mapping of eloquent regions. However, there is rare opportunity to quantify the accuracy or sensitivity of these approaches to delineate white matter fiber pathways in vivo due to the lack of a gold standard. Intraoperative electrical stimulation (IES) provides a gold standard for the location and existence of functional motor pathways that can be used to determine the accuracy and sensitivity of fiber tracking algorithms. In this study we used intraoperative stimulation from brain tumor patients as a gold standard to estimate the sensitivity and accuracy of diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) and q-ball models of diffusion with deterministic and probabilistic fiber tracking algorithms for delineation of motor pathways.
Methods: We used preoperative high angular resolution diffusion MRI (HARDI) data (55 directions, b = 2000 smm(2)) acquired in a clinically feasible time frame from 12 patients who underwent a craniotomy for resection of a cerebral glioma. The corticospinal fiber tracts were delineated with DTI and q-ball models using deterministic and probabilistic algorithms. We used cortical and white matter IES sites as a gold standard for the presence and location of functional motor pathways. Sensitivity was defined as the true positive rate of delineating fiber pathways based on cortical IES stimulation sites. For accuracy and precision of the course of the fiber tracts, we measured the distance between the subcortical stimulation sites and the tractography result. Positive predictive rate of the delineated tracts was assessed by comparison of subcortical IES motor function (upper extremity, lower extremity, face) with the connection of the tractography pathway in the motor cortex.; Results: We obtained 21 cortical and 8 subcortical IES sites from intraoperative mapping of motor pathways. Probabilistic q-ball had the best sensitivity (79%) as determined from cortical IES compared to deterministic q-ball (50%), probabilistic DTI (36%), and deterministic DTI (10%). The sensitivity using the q-ball algorithm (65%) was significantly higher than using DTI (23%) (p < 0.001) and the probabilistic algorithms (58%) were more sensitive than deterministic approaches (30%) (p = 0.003). Probabilistic q-ball fiber tracks had the smallest offset to the subcortical stimulation sites. The offsets between diffusion fiber tracks and subcortical IES sites were increased significantly for those cases where the diffusion fiber tracks were visibly thinner than expected. There was perfect concordance between the subcortical IES function (e. g. hand stimulation) and the cortical connection of the nearest diffusion fiber track (e. g. upper extremity cortex).; Discussion: This study highlights the tremendous utility of intraoperative stimulation sites to provide a gold standard from which to evaluate diffusion MRI fiber tracking methods and has provided an object standard for evaluation of different diffusion models and approaches to fiber tracking. The probabilistic q-ball fiber tractography was significantly better than DTI methods in terms of sensitivity and accuracy of the course through the white matter. The commonly used DTI fiber tracking approach was shown to have very poor sensitivity (as low as 10% for deterministic DTI fiber tracking) for delineation of the lateral aspects of the corticospinal tract in our study. Effects of the tumoredema resulted in significantly larger offsets between the subcortical IES and the preoperative fiber tracks. The provided data show that probabilistic HARDI tractography is the most objective and reproducible analysis but given the small sample and number of stimulation points a generalization about our results should be given with caution. Indeed our results inform the capabilities of preoperative diffusion fiber tracking and indicate that such data should be used carefully when making pre-surgical and intra-operative management decisions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Cavernous malformations (CMs) are congenital malformations and may be located anywhere in the brain. We present a series of CMs located close to or inside of the motor-sensory cortex or corticospinal tract (CST) with clinical onset due to hemorrhage or mass effect. In such cases, surgery becomes an acceptable option.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional-magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI), intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, neuronavigation, and brain-mapping and the clinical results of surgical treatment of CMs in this critical location.; METHODS: The study included 54 patients harboring 22 cortical and 32 deep locations. This series was distinct because in group I, where the DTI was not obtained, and in the group II, where this evaluation was performed.; RESULTS: The postoperative permanent morbidity rate was 4% in the historical group for the deeper CMs, and there was no morbidity in the second group. DTI and fMRI permitted us to estimate the distance between the CMs and both the cortical activation cluster and the pyramidal tract. These data, in addition to intraoperative mapping and monitoring, made it necessary for us to perform a partial resection in 2 cases in the second series.; CONCLUSION: CMs are congenital lesions and CST fibers can run directly on their surface. Integration of fMRI and DTI data with intraoperative functional monitoring and direct cortical and subcortical mapping are mandatory to accomplish an optimal resection, tailoring the best surgical approach to the acceptable morbidity. A subtotal resection could be considered an option for deep locations.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography-based targeting of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRT) for magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy in patients with essential tremor (ET) and correlate postprocedural tract disruption with clinical outcomes.
METHODS Four patients received preprocedural and immediate postprocedural DTI in addition to traditional anatomical MRI sequences for MRgFUS thalamotomy. Optimal ablation sites were selected based on the patient-specific location of the DRT as demonstrated by DTI (direct targeting) and correlated with traditional atlas-based measurements for thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) lesioning (indirect targeting). Fiber tracts were displayed three-dimensionally during the procedure and used in conjunction with clinical signs of tremor control for fine correction of the ablation site. Immediately following the conclusion of the procedure, the MRgFUS head frame was removed and patients were placed in a 32-channel MRI head coil for follow-up DTI and anatomical MRI sequences.; RESULTS All patients had excellent postoperative tremor control and successful pre-and postprocedural DTI fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract, medial lemniscus, and DRT. Immediate postprocedure DTI failed to track the DRT ipsilateral to the lesion site with a preserved contralateral DRT, coincident with substantial resolution of contralateral tremor.; CONCLUSIONS DTI can reliably identify the optimal ablation target and demonstrates tract disruption on immediate postprocedural imaging. A clinical improvement of ET was observed immediately following the procedure, correlating with DRT disruption and suggesting that interruption of the DRT is a consequence of clinically successful MRgFUS thalamotomy. These findings may have utility for both MRgFUS procedure planning in surgically naive patients and re-treatment of patients who have previously undergone unsuccessful thalamic Vim lesioning.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In transcranial MR -guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS), fiber tractography using diffusion tensor im - aging (DTI) has been proposed as a direct method to identify the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim), the ventral caudal nucleus (Vc), and the pyramidal tract (PT). However, the limitations of the DTI algorithm affect the accuracy of visualizing anatomical structures due to its low -quality fiber tractography, whereas the application of the generalized q -sampling imaging (GQI) algorithm enables the visualization of high -quality fiber tracts, offering detailed insights into the spatial distribution of motor cortex fibers. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the usefulness of high -precision fiber tractography using the GQI algorithm as a planning image in TcMRgFUS to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. METHODS This study included 20 patients who underwent TcMRgFUS. The Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) scores and MR images were evaluated pretreatment and at 24 hours and 3-6 months after treatment. Cases were classified based on the presence and adversity of adverse events (AEs): no AEs, mild AEs without additional treatment, and severe AEs requiring prolonged hospitalization. Fiber tractography of the Vim, Vc, and PT was visualized using the DTI and GQI algorithm. The overlapping volume between Vim fibers and the lesion was measured, and correlation analysis was performed. The relationship between AEs and the overlapping volume of the Vc and PT fibers within the lesions was examined. The cutoff value to achieve a favorable clinical outcome and avoid AEs was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS All patients showed improvement in tremors 24 hours after treatment, with 3 patients experiencing mild AEs and 1 patient experiencing severe AEs. At the 3- to 6 -month follow-up, 5 patients experienced recurrence, and 2 patients had persistent mild AEs. Although fiber visualization in the motor cortex using the DTI algorithm was insufficient, the GQI algorithm enabled the visualization of significantly higher -quality fibers. A strong correlation was observed between the overlapping volume that intersects the lesion and Vim fibers and the degree of tremor improvement (r = 0.72). Higher overlapping volumes of Vc and PT within the lesion were associated with an increased likelihood of AEs (p < 0.05); the cutoff volume of Vim fibers within the lesion for a favorable clinical outcome was 401 mm 3 , while the volume of Vc and PT within the lesion to avoid AEs was 99 mm(3). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study suggests that incorporating the high -precision GQI algorithm for fiber tractography as a planning imaging technique for TcMRgFUS has the potential to enhance targeting precision and achieve favorable clinical outcomes.

N2  -  Background and purpose Brain tumors may dislocate, infiltrate, or disrupt the adjacent fiber tracts. We examined (1) microstructural changes of white matter (WM) adjacent to supratentorial low grade tumors in children and (2) WM tracts of the affected hemisphere using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We hypothesized that the structural integrity of the adjacent WM tracts would be preserved in these slow-growing tumors.
Materials and methods DTI was performed in 11 children with low grade tumors diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regions of interest were placed in the tumor, in WM adjacent to tumor, and on the normal contralateral side. Fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, and eigenvalues were measured. Color-coded maps and tractography were used to grade the WM tracts: Grade one was normal tract size and color hue; grade two was reduced tract size but preserved color hue; and grade three was loss of color hue or failure to track on tractography. Grades one and two were subcategorized as "a" or "b," depending on the absence or presence of tract displacement.; Results There were no significant differences in FA, trace, and eigenvalues between WM adjacent to tumor and the contralateral side. One patient had grade 1a changes, six grade 1b, and four grade 2b.; Conclusion We found preserved microstructural integrity of WM adjacent to low grade tumors in children. Color vector maps and tractography demonstrated displacement of the WM tracts in all but one patient. Our findings could be useful for neurosurgical planning to minimize injury to the WM tracts and improve preoperative risk analysis.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) enables preoperative mapping of the motor cortex (M1). The combination of nTMS with diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI-FT) of the corticospinal tract (CST) has been described; however, its impact on surgery of motor-eloquent lesions has not been addressed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of nTMS-based mapping on surgery of motor-eloquent lesions.
METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, we reviewed the data of patients operated for suspected motor-eloquent lesions between 2012 and 2015. The patients underwent nTMS mapping of M1 and, from 2014, nTMS-based DTI-FT of the CST. The impact on the preoperative riskbenefit analysis, surgical strategy, craniotomy size, extent of resection (EOR), and outcome were compared with a control group.; RESULTS: We included 35 patients who underwent nTMS mapping of M1 (group A), 35 patients who also underwent nTMS-based DTI-FT of the CST (group B), and a control group composed of 35 patients treated without nTMS (group C). The patients in groups A and B received smaller craniotomies (P =.01; P =.001), had less postoperative seizures (P =.02), and a better postoperativemotor performance (P=. 04) and Karnofsky Performance Status (P=. 009) than the controls. Group B exhibited an improved riskbenefit analysis (P=. 006), an increased EOR of nTMS-negative lesions in absence of preoperative motor deficits (P =.01), and less motor and Karnofsky Performance Status worsening in case of preoperative motor deficits (P =.02, P =.03) than group A.; CONCLUSION: nTMS-based mapping enables a tailored surgical approach for motoreloquent lesions. It may improve the riskbenefit analysis, EOR and outcome, particularly when nTMS-based DTI-FT is performed.

N2  -  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is used to characterize the diffusion properties of deviated white matter caused by brain tumors. DTI was recently shown to be very helpful in delineating white matter both within brain lesions and surrounding them. Displacement of white matter fibers may be one of the consequences of tumor growth adjacent to white matter. The combination of white matter mapping with DTI and gray matter mapping using functional MRI, in some cases, facilitated assessment of the relation between the shifted cortical areas and the corresponding white matter tracts. We found that the fractional anisotropy extracted from DTI is increased by 38% in areas of non-edematous shifted white matter fibers. By contrast, trace apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in those areas were found to be similar to contralateral side and normal control values. Analysis of the three diffusion tensor eigenvalues revealed that the increase in the fractional anisotropy is a result of two processes. The first is the increase in the diffusion parallel to the fibers-lambda(1) (by 18%), and the second is the decrease in the diffusion perpendicular to fibers-lambda(3) (by 34%) as compared with the contralateral side. These opposing changes cause an increase in the diffusion anisotropy but no change in the trace ADC. It is suggested that the pressure caused by the tumor may lead to an increase in white matter fiber tension, thus causing an increase in lambda(1). On the other hand, the same pressure causes increased fiber density per unit area, leading to a higher degree of restricted diffusion in the extracellular space and, hence, a reduction in lambda(3).

N2  -  Background and Purpose Assessment of the essential white matter fibers of arcuate fasciculus and corticospinal tract (CST), required for preoperative planning in brain tumor patients, relies on the reliability of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The recent development of multiband DTI (mb-DTI) based on simultaneous multislice excitation could maintain the overall quality of tractography while not exceeding standard clinical care time. To address this potential, we performed quantitative analyses to evaluate tractography results of arcuate fasciculus and CST acquired by mb-DTI in brain tumor patients.
Methods We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with brain lesions who underwent presurgical single-shot DTI (s-DTI) and mb-DTI. We measured DTI parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD mm(2) s(-1)) in whole brain and tumor regions; and the tractography parameters: fiber FA, MD (mm(2) s(-1)), volume (mm(3)), and length (mm) in the whole brain, arcuate fasciculus, and CST. Additionally, three neuroradiologists performed a blinded visual assessment comparing s-DTI with mb-DTI.; Results The mb-DTI showed higher mean FA and lower MD (r > .95, p < .002) in whole brain and tumor regions of interest; slightly higher fiber FA, volume, and length; and slightly lower fiber MD in whole brain, arcuate fasciculus, and CST than in s-DTI. These differences were significant for fiber FA in all tracts; length (mm) in arcuate fasciculus; and fiber MD (mm(2) s(-1)) and volume (mm(3)) in all patients with tumor involved in the arcuate fasciculus, CST, and whole brain tracts (p = .001). Visual assessment demonstrated that both techniques produced visually similar tracts.; Conclusions This study demonstrated the clinical potential and significant advantages of preoperative mb-DTI in brain tumor patients.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows visualization of the main white matter tracts while intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) represents the gold standard for surgical resection of gliomas. In recent years, the use of small craniotomies has gained popularity thanks to neuronavigation and to the low morbidity rates associated with shorter surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to review a series of patients operated for glioma using DTI, IONM, and tumor-targeted craniotomies. The retrospective analysis included patients with supratentorial glioma who met the following inclusion criteria: preoperative DTI, intraoperative IONM, tumor-targeted craniotomy, pre- and postoperative MRI, and complete clinical charts. The DTI was performed on a 3T scanner. The IONM included electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial (TC) and/or cortical motor-evoked potentials (MEP), electrocorticography (ECoG), and direct electrical stimulation (DES). Outcomes included postoperative neurological deficits, volumetric extent of resection (EOR), and overall survival (OS). One hundred and three patients (61 men, 42 women; mean age 54 +/- 14 years) were included and presented the following WHO histologies: 65 grade IV, 19 grade III, and 19 grade II gliomas. After 3 months, only three patients had new neurological deficits. The median postoperative volume was 0cc (IQR 3). The median OS for grade IV gliomas was 15 months, while for low-grade gliomas it was not reached. In our experience, a small craniotomy and a tumor resection supported by IONM and DTI permitted to achieve satisfactory results in terms of neurological outcomes, EOR, and OS for glioma patients.

N2  -  A common means of studying motor recovery in stroke patients is to extract Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) parameters from the corticospinal tract (CST) and correlate them with clinical outcome scores. To that purpose, conducting group-level analyses through spatial normalization has become a popular approach. However, the reliability of such analyses depends on the accuracy of the particular registration strategy employed. To date, most studies have employed scalar-based registration using either high-resolution T1 images or Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps to warp diffusion data to a common space. However, more powerful registration algorithms exist for aligning major white matter structures, such as Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD)-based registration. Regardless of the strategy chosen, automatic normalization algorithms are prone to distortions caused by stroke lesions. While lesion masking is a common means to lessen such distortions, the extent of its effect on tract-related DTI parameters and their correlation with motor outcome has yet to be determined. Here, we aimed to address these concerns by first investigating the effect of common T1 and FA-based registration as well as novel FOD-based registration algorithms with and without lesion masking on lesion load and DTI parameter extraction of the CST in datasets typically acquired for subacute-chronic and acute stroke patients. Second, we studied how differences in these procedures influenced correlation strength between CST damage (through DTI parameters) and motor outcome. Our results showed that, for high-quality subacute-chronic stroke data, FOD-based registration captured significantly higher lesion loads and significantly larger FA asymmetries in the CST. This was also associated with significantly stronger correlations in motor outcome with respect to T1 or FA-based registration methods. For acute data acquired in a clinical setting, there were few observed differences, suggesting that commonly employed FA-based registration is appropriate for group-level analyses.

N2  -  Purpose In patients with supratentorial lesions diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI-FT) is increasingly used to visualize subcortical fiber courses. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) was applied in this study to reveal specific cortical functions by investigating the particular language errors elicited by stimulation. To make DTI-FT more function-specific, the identified language-positive nTMS spots were used as regions of interest (ROIs). Methods In this study 40 patients (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.0 years) harboring language-eloquent left hemispheric lesions underwent preoperative nTMS language mapping. All induced error categories were separately defined as a ROI and used for function-specific nTMS-based DTI-FT. The fractions of patients showing various subcortical language-related pathways and the fibers-per-tract ratio (number of visualized fibers divided by the number of visualized tracts) were evaluated and compared for tractography with the single error types against less specific tractography including all identified cortical language sites (all errors except hesitations). Results The nTMS-based DTI-FT using all errors except hesitations led to high fractions of visualized tracts (81.1% of patients), with a fibers-per-tract ratio of 538.4 +/- 340.5. When only using performance errors, a predominant visualization of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) occurred, which is known to be involved in articulatory processes. Fibers-per-tract ratios were comparatively stable for all single error categories when compared to all errors except hesitations (p > 0.05). Conclusion This is one of the first studies aiming on function-specific tractography. The results demonstrated that when using different error categories as ROIs, more detailed nTMS-based DTI-FT and, therefore, potentially superior intraoperative guidance becomes possible.

N2  -  Background. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and white matter tractography (WMT) are promising techniques for estimating the course, extent, and connectivity patterns of the white matter (WM) structures in the human brain. In this study, we investigated the ability of DTI and WMT to visualize white matter tract involvement for the preoperative surgical planning and postoperative assessment of brainstem lesions.
Methods. Preoperative and postoperative DTI data (echo-planar, 1.5T) were retrospectively analyzed in 10 patients with brainstem lesions (3 diffuse, 7 focal). WMT applying a tensor deflection algorithm was used to reconstruct WM tracts adjacent to the lesions. Reconstructed tracts included corticospinal tracts and medial lemnisci. The clinical and imaging follow-up data were also compared and analyzed.; Findings. WMT revealed a series of tract alteration patterns including deviation, deformation, infiltration, and apparent tract interruption. WMT reconstructions showed that the major WM tracts were preserved during surgery and improved in position and appearance postoperatively. These findings correlated with the improvement or preservation of neurological function as determined by clinical assessment.; Conclusions. Compared with the information provided by conventional MR imaging, DTI and WMT provided superior quantification and visualization of lesion involvement in eloquent fibre tracts of the brainstem. Moreover, DTI and WMT were found to be beneficial for white matter recognition in the neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brainstem lesions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) estimates the course and connectivity patterns of white matter tracts. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether findings in the brain stem modify the preoperative surgical trajectory planning or postoperative outcome in patients with brain stem cavernous malformations.
METHODS: Ten patients with symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformation underwent surgical resection. Five patients received preoperative DTI evaluation and the remaining 5 did not. Reconstructed DTI tracts consisted of corticospinal, medial lemnisci, and cerebellar peduncles. The surgical planning and postoperative outcome were evaluated.; RESULTS: In 5 patients with no preoperative DTI evaluation, surgical planning was based on anatomic landmark and the 2-point technique. The other 5 patients underwent preoperative DTI, and findings were factored into the selection of the surgical approach. In 3 of the 5 cases with DTI evaluation, the 2-point technique suggested a similar trajectory. In the other 2, the DTI findings suggested a different approach to avoid damage to the white matter tract. Two patients in the group with no DTI had immediate postoperative new or worsened deficit, which improved at long-term follow-up. No patient in the DTI group had a new neurologic deficit.; CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the standard magnetic resonance imaging, DTI provided improved visualization of cavernous malformation involvement in eloquent fiber tracts of the brainstem. This additional information might help in selecting a more appropriate surgical trajectory in selected lesions. Larger patient cohorts are needed to assess the effect of this modality in patients' outcome.

N2  -  PurposeWe developed a navigation system that superimposes the fractional anisotropy (FA) color map of pre-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The current study aimed to investigate the usefulness of this system for neurophysiological monitoring and examination under awake craniotomy during tumor removal. MethodA total of 10 glioma patients (4 patients with right-side tumors; 5 men and 5 women; average age, 34 years) were evaluated. Among them, the tumor was localized to the frontal lobe, insular cortex, and parietal lobe in 8, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. There were 3 patients who underwent surgery on general anesthesia, while 7 patients underwent awake craniotomy. The index of DTI anisotropy taken pre-operatively (magnetic field: 3 tesla, 6 motion probing gradient directions) was analyzed as a color map (FA color map) and concurrently co-registered in the intraoperative MRI within the navigation. In addition to localization of the bipolar coagulator and the cortical stimulator for brain mapping on intraoperative MRI, the pre-operative FA color map was also concurrently integrated and displayed on the navigation monitor. This white matter nerve functional information was confirmed directly by using neurological examination and referring to the electrophysiological monitoring. ResultsIntraoperative MRI, integrated pre-operative FA color map, and microscopic surgical view were displayed on one screen in all 10 patients, and white matter fibers including the pyramidal tract were displayed as a reference in blue. Regarding motor function, motor-evoked potential was monitored as appropriate in all cases, and removal was possible while directly confirming motor symptoms under awake craniotomy. Furthermore, the white matter fibers including the superior longitudinal fasciculus were displayed in green. Importantly, it was useful not only to localize the resection site, but to identify language-related, eye movement-related, and motor fibers at the electrical stimulation site. All motor and/or language white matter tracts were identified and visualized with the co-registration and then with an acceptable post-operative neurological outcome. ConclusionCo-registering an intraoperative MR images and a pre-operative FA color map is a practical and useful method to predict the localization of critical white matter nerve functions intraoperatively in glioma surgery.

N2  -  Prior to resection of a cerebral brain tumor, mapping of the functional and structural anatomy of the adjacent tissue is essential to reduce the risk of damage to descending and ascending pathways. We investigated the effectiveness of concurrent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to delineate the motor cortex and associated corticospinal tract (CST) in a case series of children with brain tumors seen for pre-surgical evaluation. Using activation points generated from MEG to launch tractography, we delineated the CST of four patients and eight control subjects. Displacement of the CST was considerably larger in children with tumors located in the center of the hemisphere than in children whose tumors were more posteriorly located. Our findings suggest that the use of concurrent MEG and DTI may be an effective tool in the pre-surgical evaluation of eloquent cortex and associated white matter tracts in pediatric brain tumor patients.

N2  -  Objective : To investigate the efficiency of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber-tracking based neuronavigation and assess its usefulness in the preoperative surgical planning, prognostic prediction, intraoperative course and outcome improvement.
Methods : Seventeen patients with cerebral masses adjacent to corticospinal tract (CST) were given standard magnetic resonance imaging and DTI examination. By incorporation of DTI data, the relation between tumor and adjacent white matter tracts was reconstructed and assessed in the neuronavigation system. Distance from tumor border to CST was measured.; Results : The sub-portion of CST in closest proximity to tumor was found displaced in all patients. The chief disruptive changes were classified as follows : complete interruption, partial interruption, or simple displacement. Partial interruption was evident in seven patients (41.2%) whose lesions were close to cortex. In the other 10 patients (58.8%), delineated CSTs were intact but distorted. No complete CST interruption was identified. Overall, the mean distance from resection border to CST was 6.12 mm (range, 0-21), as opposed to 8.18 mm (range, 2-21) with simple displacement and 2.33 mm (range, 0-5) with partial interruption. The clinical outcomes were analyzed in groups stratified by intervening distances (close, <5 mm; moderated, 5-10 mm; far, >10 mm). For the primary brain tumor patients, the proportion of completely resected tumors increased progressively from close to far grouping (42.9%, 50%, and 100%, respectively). Five patients out of seven (71.4%) experienced new neurologic deficits postoperatively in the close group. At meantime, motor deterioration was found in six cases in the close group. All patients in the far and moderate groups received excellent (modified Rankin Scale mRS score, 0-1) or good (mRS score, 2-3) rankings, but only 57.1% of patients in the close group earned good outcome scores.; Conclusion : DTI fiber tracking based neuronavigation has merit in assessing the relation between lesions and adjacent white matter tracts, allowing prediction of patient outcomes based on lesion-CST distance. It has also proven beneficial in formulating surgical strategies.

N2  -  Non-invasive in vivo visualization of white matter fiber tracts is currently feasible by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques. DTI-derived metrics, like fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), have the potential to improve tissue characterization. Technical optimization of diffusion tensor sequences, including signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, was performed for 20 normal subjects. High- and low-resolution DTI sequences were applied on all subjects and FA, MD parametric maps were reconstructed for both protocols. Voxel-based statistical analysis revealed regions with significantly different FA and MD values between the two sequences, while the same type of analysis was performed to illustrate regions with significantly different signal-to-noise ratio. In conclusion, optimized DTI sequences may be applied routinely in clinical practice with a standard MR scanner, while accurate quantification of FA and MD may improve lesion characterization.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is amagnetic resonance-based imaging technique that can provide important information about the underlying structure and integrity of the white matter in the brain. Tractography, a DTI postprocessing technique, can provide a detailed model of individual white matter fiber tracts. Knowledge of these tracts may be beneficial in the surgical planning and execution for neurosurgical patients.
Case Report: We review the basic principles behind DTI and present an illustrative case in which DTI was used to delineate the relationship of eloquent white matter tracts to a cavernous malformation in a patient undergoing resection.; Conclusion: The use of DTI during preoperative planning allows the neurosurgeon to understand if a lesion is disrupting, infiltrating, or altering the course of local white matter tracts. With the combined use of DTI and intraoperative neuronavigation, the neurosurgeon can better identify and avoid white matter tracts, not only in the local area of resection but also during approach to the lesion, thereby reducing the risk of damage to vital cortical pathways and subsequent functional impairment.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a recent technique that utilizes diffusion of water molecules to make assumptions about white matter tract architecture of the brain. Early on, neurosurgeons recognized its potential value in neurosurgical planning, as it is the only technique that offers the possibility for in vivo visualization of white matter tracts. In this review we give an overview of the current advances made with this technique in neurosurgical practice. The effect of brain shift and the limitations of the technique are highlighted, followed by a comprehensive discussion on its objective value. Although there are many limitations and pitfalls associated with this technique, DTI can provide valuable additional diagnostic information to the neurosurgeon. We conclude that current evidence supports a role for DTI in the multimodal navigation during tumor surgery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The combined application of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor based tractography is a reliable technique to localize cortico-subcortical functional systems of the brain. This technical feature will be particularly important for image-guided neurosurgery as well as for intaroperative imaging in future.
Due to methodological limitations and external factors (intraoperative brain shift, interstitial brain edema) these MR imaging modalities need to be supplemented by intraoperative electrophysiological mapping techniques. For this purpose, navigated bipolar stimulation is especially appropriate to validate imaging findings and to preserve the functional integrity of cortico-subcortical systems.

N2  -  PurposeTask-based BOLD fMRI and DTI-fiber tracking have become part of the routine presurgical work-up of brain tumor patients in many institutions. However, their potential impact on both surgical treatment and neurologic outcome remains unclear, in despite of the high costs and complex implementation.MethodsWe retrospectively investigated whether performing fMRI and DTI-ft preoperatively substantially impacted surgical planning and patient outcome in a series of brain tumor patients. We assessed (i) the quality of fMRI and DTI-ft results, by using a scale of 0-2 (0 = failed mapping; 1 = intermediate confidence; 2 = good confidence), (ii) whether functional planning substantially contributed to defining the surgical strategy to be undertaken (i.e., no surgery, biopsy, or resection, with or without ESM), the surgical entry point and extent of resection, and (iii) the incidence of neurological deficits post-operatively.ResultsTwenty-seven patients constituted the study population. The mean confidence rating was 1.9/2 for fMRI localization of the eloquent cortex and lateralization of the language function and 1.7/2 for DTI-ft results. Treatment strategy was altered in 33% (9/27) of cases. Surgical entry point was modified in 8% (2/25) of cases. The extent of resection was modified in 40% (10/25). One patient (1/25, 4%) developed one new functional deficit post-operatively.ConclusionFunctional MR mapping - which must not be considered an alternative to ESM - has a critical role preoperatively, potentially modifying treatment strategy or increasing the neurosurgeons' confidence in the surgical approach hypothesized based on conventional imaging.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-based tractography has gained increasing popularity as a method for detailed visualization of white matter (WM) tracts. Different imaging techniques, and more novel, advanced imaging methods provide significant WM structural detail. While there has been greater focus on improving tract visualization for larger WM pathways, the relative value of each method for cranial nerve reconstruction and how this methodology can assist surgical decision-making is still understudied. Images from 10 patients with posterior fossa tumors (4 male, mean age: 63.5), affecting either the trigeminal nerve (CN V) or the facial/vestibular complex (CN VII/VIII), were employed. Three distinct reconstruction methods [two tensor-based methods: single diffusion tensor tractography (SDT) (3D Slicer), eXtended streamline tractography (XST), and one fiber orientation distribution (FOD)-based method: streamline tractography using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-derived estimates (MRtrix3)], were compared to determine which of these was best suited for use in a neurosurgical setting in terms of processing speed, anatomical accuracy, and accurate depiction of the relationship between the tumor and affected CN. Computation of the tensor map was faster when compared to the implementation of CSD to provide estimates of FOD. Both XST and CSD-based reconstruction methods tended to give more detailed representations of the projections of CN V and CN VII/VIII compared to SDT. These reconstruction methods were able to more accurately delineate the course of CN V and CN VII/VIII, differentiate CN V from the cerebellar peduncle, and delineate compression of CN VII/VIII in situations where SDT could not. However, CSD-based reconstruction methods tended to generate more invalid streamlines. XST offers the best combination of anatomical accuracy and speed of reconstruction of cranial nerves within this patient population. Given the possible anatomical limitations of single tensor models, supplementation with more advanced tensor-based reconstruction methods might be beneficial.

N2  -  Background. In deep-seated brain tumors, adequate preoperative planning is mandatory to assess the best surgical corridor to obtain maximal safe resection. Functional diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) tractography based on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) motor mapping has proven to be a valid preoperative examination method in adults. The aim of this paper is to present the application of nTMS and functional DTI tractography in a series of pediatric diencephalic tumors. Material and methods. Three patients affected by thalamic (one) and thalamopeduncular tumor (two) were successfully examined with nTMS motor mapping and DTI tractography between October 2020 and October 2021 (F:M 3:0, mean age 12 years +/- 0.8). Cortical representation of leg, hand and mouth were determined in the affected hemisphere and the positive stimulation spots were set as seeds point for tractography. Results. Mapping of the motor cortex and tracts reconstruction for leg and hand were successful in all patients, while facial function was properly mapped in one patient only. In all cases, the procedure was well tolerated and no adverse events were recorded. Spatial relationships between tumor and functional tissue guided the surgical planning. Extent of the resection varied from 96.1% to 100% with a postoperative new motor deficit in one patient. Conclusions. nTMS and DTI fiber tracking is a feasible, effective and well-tolerated method to identify motor pathway in deep-seated lesion in pediatric population.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively.
Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment.; Reconstructed DTI (1718) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30 +- 0.079 and 1.70 +- 0.35 mm(2)s in normal fibers, 0.22 +- 0.04 and 1.49 +- 0.49 mm(2)s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24 +- 0.08 and 1.51 +- 0.52 mm(2)s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n = 4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n = 2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n = 2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruptiondestruction with complete disorganization (n = 6) or fiber displacement (n = 1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae.; Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus, therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard anatomic imaging protocols.

N2  -  ObjectiveTo evaluate white matter (WM) integrity of distinct groups of patients with antiepileptic drug (AED)-resistant localization-related epilepsies.
MethodsWe used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber-tractography and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate differences of WM micro- and macrostructural integrity in patients with different drug-resistant localization-related epilepsies: 17 with temporal lobe epilepsy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 17 with TLE and normal MRI (TLE-NL), 14 with frontal lobe epilepsy and subtle MRI signs of focal cortical dysplasia (FLE-FCD), and 112 healthy controls. We performed fiber-tractography using a semiautomatic deterministic method to yield average fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivity ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptogenic zone of the following tracts based on their functional and anatomic relevance: body of fornix (BoF), body of cingulum (BoC), inferior frontal occipital (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi (UF). In addition, we performed VBM of the WM maps to assess macrostructural integrity differences among groups.; ResultsTLE-HS had ipsilateral and contralateral decreased FA and increased RD for all tracts. VBM showed WM alterations mainly in the ipsilateral parahippocampal region and contralateral superior temporal gyrus. FLE-FCD showed bilateral FA decreases only in the BoC and ipsilateral RD increases also in the BoC. VBM showed WM reduction mainly in the ipsilateral precuneus and posterior and anterior cingulum. No significant WM alterations were found in the TLE-NL in DTI or VBM analysis.; SignificanceWM abnormalities differ in distinct AED-resistant localization-related epilepsies. The diverse distribution of the WM damage in these patients suggests that the localization of the epileptic networks may play a role in the WM burden. However, the distinct degree of this damage, more accentuated in TLE-HS, also suggests that the underlying cause of the epilepsy is probably an additional factor to explain this WM damage.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CVJ lesion suffers from a high sensitivity to susceptibility and distortion artifacts, which sometimes makes diffusion image difficult to interpret. Our purpose was to evaluate the potential for diffusion MR imaging using RS-EPI compared with SS-EPI in the assessment of the CVJ.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RS-EPI and SS-EPI DTI images were acquired from 10 healthy volunteers using 3T MRI with a 32-channel head coil. For both sequences, the following parameters were used: 1-mm(2) in-plane resolution; 3-mm section thickness; TR = 5200 ms; 1 acquisition at b = 0 and 12 different encoding directions at b = 1000 secondsmm(2). The RS-EPI sequence scan time was 9.44 minutes (1 average). The SS-EPI sequence was 9.37 minutes (8 averages). Diffusion tensor calculation and image analysis were performed using DTIStudio software. Diffusion trace images and color-coded fiber orientation maps were evaluated by 2 independent readers for distortion and delineation of fine structure using a semiquantitative scale in selected landmark locations. The absolute distances between the temporal base and the cerebellar contour between the T2-weighted images and the diffusion trace images obtained with RS-EPI and SS-EPI were also compared.; RESULTS: The contours of the temporal lobe and cerebellum were better delineated and distortion artifacts were clearly reduced with the RS-EPI sequence. More fine structures were also visible in the brain stem and cerebellum with the RS-EPI sequence. The amount of distortion was significantly reduced with RS-EPI compared with SS-EPI (P < .01).; CONCLUSIONS: The RS-EPI DTI sequence was less prone to geometric distortion than the SS-EPI sequence and allowed a better delineation of CVJ internal structure. Although the acquisition time is still relatively long, the RS-EPI appears as a promising approach to perform DTI studies in CVJ lesions, such as brain stem ischemia, neurodegenerative diseases, brain and skull base tumors, or inflammation.

N2  -  Animal models of stroke demonstrated that white matter ischemia may cause both axonal damage and myelin degradation distant from the core lesion, thereby impacting on behavior and functional outcome after stroke. We here used parameters derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effect of focal white matter ischemia on functional reorganization within the motor system. Patients (n = 18) suffering from hand motor deficits in the subacute or chronic stage after subcortical stroke and healthy controls (n = 12) were scanned with both diffusion MRI and functional MRI while performing a motor task with the left or right hand. A laterality index was employed on activated voxels to assess functional reorganization across hemispheres. Regression analyses revealed that diffusion MRI parameters of both the ipsilesional corticospinal tract (CST) and corpus callosum (CC) predicted increased activation of the unaffected hemisphere during movements of the stroke-affected hand. Changes in diffusion MRI parameters possibly reflecting axonal damage and/or destruction of myelin sheath correlated with a stronger bilateral recruitment of motor areas and poorer motor performance. Probabilistic fiber tracking analyses revealed that the region in the CC correlating with the fMRI laterality index and motor deficits connected to sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, ventral premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, and temporoparietal junction. The results suggest that degeneration of transcallosal fibers connecting higher order sensorimotor regions constitute a relevant factor influencing cortical reorganization and motor outcome after subcortical stroke.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Stroke has functional sequelae, including motor weakness, spasticity, dysphagia, and neurogenic bladder deteriorating activities of daily living. Speech therapy is more often an essential part of the rehabilitation program. Studies in aphasia have primarily focused on two major pathways: the arcuate fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a major fiber bundle connecting Broca's area (associated with language production) and Wernicke's area (associated with language comprehension). Damage to this pathway can result in different types of aphasia, depending on the location and extent of the injury.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Tractography is a neuroimaging technique used to map the white matter tracts in the brain. Our patient had an occlusion of the external carotid and left carotid siphon. The patient exhibited early complex language deficits involving both motor expressive and comprehensive abilities. After three months the patient presented conduction aphasia caused by damage to the inferior parietal lobule, which extends into the subcortical white matter and damages the arcuate fascicle. This patient was re-assessed for spasticity and language treatments needs, few months after the stroke. Considering first two months language improvement followed by any further language expressive improvement from 3rd to 6th month, a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was requested to study interconnections between cortical and subcortical matter. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in our hospital showed an extensive malacic gliotic area in the left temporal-frontal parietal site.; CONCLUSION: Brain MRI is confirmed as a multimodal tool evaluating the damage, both from the point of structural and functional view. Tractography in aphasia allows focusing on major pathways. The involvement of the arcuate fascicle, whose lesion disconnects Broca's and Wernicke's areas, is related to clinical improvement, and represents a neural correlate of the brain injury recovery process that physicians and speech therapists might be aware of it, tailoring the plane of care of each patient.

N2  -  Objective. Brain injury in premature infants is characterized predominantly by perinatally acquired lesions in the cerebral white matter (WM). The impact of such injury on the subsequent development of cerebral WM is not clear. This study uses diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the effects of cerebral WM injury on subsequent microstructural brain development in different WM areas of the brain.
Methods. Twenty premature infants (gestational age: 29.1 +- 1.9 weeks) were studied by conventional MRI within the first 3 weeks of life and again at term, with the addition at the latter time of diffusion tensor MRI. Ten of the preterm infants had cerebral WM injury identified by the early MRI and were matched with 10 premature infants of similar gestational age and neonatal course but with normal neonatal MRI scans. Diffusion tensor MRI at term was acquired in coronal and axial planes and used to determine the apparent diffusion coefficient, a measure of overall restriction to water diffusion, and the relative anisotropy (RA), a measure of preferred directionality of diffusion, in central WM, anterior frontal WM, occipital WM, temporal WM, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Diffusion vector maps were generated from the diffusion tensor analysis to define the microstructural architecture of the cerebral WM regions.; Results. At term, the diffusion tensor MRI revealed no difference in apparent diffusion coefficient among preterm infants with or without perinatal WM lesions. By contrast, RA, the measure of preferred directionality of diffusion and thereby dependent on development of axonal fibers and oligodendroglia, was 25% lower in central WM, the principal site of the original WM injury. However, RA was unaffected in relatively uninjured WM areas, such as temporal, anterior frontal, and occipital regions. Notably, RA values in the internal capsule, which contains fibers that descend from the injured cerebral WM, were 20% lower in the infants with WM injury versus those without. Diffusion vector maps showed striking alterations in the size, orientation, and organization of fiber tracts in central WM and in those descending to the internal capsule.; Conclusions. Perinatal cerebral WM injury seems to have major deleterious effects on subsequent development of fiber tracts both in the cerebral WM and more distally. The ultimate impact of brain injury in the newborn should be considered as a function not only of tissue destruction, but also of impaired subsequent brain development.

N2  -  The position and extent of individual fiber tracts within the white matter of human brains can be identified in vivo using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking methods. Previous to this study, however, the lack of three-dimensional (3-D) probability maps precluded comparing the anatomical precision of MRI studies with microscopically defined fiber tracts in human postmortem brains. The present study provides 3-D registered maps of the topography, course and intersubject variability of major fiber tracts, which were identified at microscopic resolution. The analyzed tracts include the corticospinal tract, optic and acoustic radiations, fornix, cingulum, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal, superior and inferior occipitofrontal and uncinate fascicles; sources and targets of fiber tracts include the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and mamillary bodies. Tracts and nuclei were identified in serial myelin-stained histological sections of ten postmortem brains. The sections were 3-D reconstructed and registered to a standardized stereotaxic space of an in vivo MR reference brain by means of linear and non-linear, elastic transformations. The individual fiber tracts and nuclei were superimposed in the reference space, and probability maps were generated as a quantitative measure of intersubject variability for each voxel of the stereotaxic space. This study presents the first stereotaxic atlas of the course, location and extent of fiber tracts and related nuclei based on microscopically defined localization and topographic data taken at multiple levels on each of the three orthogonal planes. The maps are useful for evaluating and identifying fiber bundles in DTI, for localizing subcortical lesions visible in anatomical MR images and for studying neuronal connectivity.

N2  -  Fibre tract delineation from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable clinical tool for neurosurgical planning and navigation, as well as in research neuroimaging pipelines. Several popular methods are used for this task, each with different strengths and weaknesses making them more or less suited to different contexts. For neurosurgical imaging, priorities include ease of use, computational efficiency, robustness to pathology and ability to generalise to new tracts of interest. Many existing methods use streamline tractography, which may require expert neuroimaging operators for setting parameters and delineating anatomical regions of interest, or suffer from as a lack of generalisability to clinical scans involving deforming tumours and other pathologies. More recently, data-driven approaches including deep-learning segmentation models and streamline clustering methods have improved reproducibility and automation, although they can require large amounts of training data and/or computationally intensive image processing at the point of application. We describe an atlas-based direct tract mapping technique called 'tractfinder', utilising tract-specific location and orientation priors. Our aim was to develop a clinically practical method avoiding streamline tractography at the point of application while utilising prior anatomical knowledge derived from only 10-20 training samples. Requiring few training samples allows emphasis to be placed on producing high quality, neuro-anatomically accurate training data, and enables rapid adaptation to new tracts of interest. Avoiding streamline tractography at the point of application reduces computational time, false positives and vulnerabilities to pathology such as tumour deformations or oedema. Carefully filtered training streamlines and track orientation distribution mapping are used to construct tract specific orientation and spatial probability atlases in standard space. Atlases are then transformed to target subject space using affine registration and compared with the subject's voxel-wise fibre orientation distribution data using a mathematical measure of distribution overlap, resulting in a map of the tract's likely spatial distribution. This work includes extensive performance evaluation and comparison with benchmark techniques, including streamline tractography and the deep-learning method TractSeg, in two publicly available healthy diffusion MRI datasets (from TractoInferno and the Human Connectome Project) in addition to a clinical dataset comprising paediatric and adult brain tumour scans. Tract segmentation results display high agreement with established techniques while requiring less than 3 min on average when applied to a new subject. Results also display higher robustness than compared methods when faced with clinical scans featuring brain tumours and resections. As well as describing and evaluating a novel proposed tract delineation technique, this work continues the discussion on the challenges surrounding the white matter segmentation task, including issues of anatomical definitions and the use of quantitative segmentation comparison metrics.
A rapid atlas-based direct white matter tract segmentation technique is extensively validated in three different datasets with consistent and strong results. Improved performance and explainability in the presence of pathology is demonstrated over alternatives methods. image

N2  -  OBJECIIVE: To evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based functional neuronavigation in surgery of cerebral gliomas with pyramidal tract (PT) involvement with respect to both perioperative assessment and follow-up outcome.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted between 2001 and 2005. A consecutive series of 238 eligible patients with initial imaging diagnosis of cerebral gliomas involving PTs were randomized into study (n = 118) and control (n = 120) groups. The study cases underwent DTI and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The maps of fractional anisotropy were calculated for PT mapping. Both three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data sets and fractional anisotropy maps were integrated by rigid registration, after which the tumor and adjacent PT were segmented and reconstructed for presurgical planning and intraoperative guidance. The control cases were operated on using routine neuronavigation.; RESULTS: There was a trend for high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in the study group to be more likely to achieve gross total resection (74.4 versus 33.3%, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference of low-grade gliomas resection between the two groups. Postoperative motor deterioration occurred in 32.8% of control cases, whereas it occurred in only 15.3% of the study cases (P < 0.001). The 6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of study cases was significantly higher than that of control cases (86 +- 20 versus 74 +- 28 overall, P < 0.001; 93 10 versus 86 17 for low-grade gliomas, P 0.013; and 77 +- 27 versus 53 +- 32 for HGGs, P = 0.001). For 81 HGGs, the median survival of study cases was 21.2 months (95% confidence interval, 14.1-28.3 mo) compared with 14.0 months (95% confidence interval, 10.2-17.8 mo) of control cases (P 0.048). The estimated hazard ratio for the effect of DTI-based functional neuronavigation was 0.570, representing a 43.0% reduction in the risk of death.; CONCLUSION: DTI-based functional neuronavigation contributes to maximal safe resection of cerebral gliomas with PT involvement, thereby decreasing postoperative motor deficits for both HGGs and low-grade gliomas while increasing high-quality survival for HGGs.

N2  -  The role of the lesion location within functional pain systems is not fully understood for central poststroke pain (CPSP) pathogenesis. In a patient with CPSP we used data from both functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for anatomo-functional correlations. Structural MRI showed a small residual cavity confined to the right thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus and the adjacent posterior arm of the internal capsule. DTI maps showed selective reduction of right sensory thalamocortical fibers. Functional MRI, performed with different thermonociceptive stimuli, showed pain-specific signal changes in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32) and in the associative parietal regions (BA 5/7). These findings underline, for CPSP pathogenesis, the role of damage of lateral nociceptive thalamoparietal fibers together with the release of activity of anterior cingulate and posterior parietal regions.
Perspective: in a patient with CPSP, we combined noninvasive neuroimaging techniques (functional and diffusion MRI) to assess the anatomo-functional relationship in CPSP. Our investigations show, for CPSP pathogenesis, the role of damage of lateral nociceptive thalamoparietal fibers together with the release of activity of anterior cingulate and posterior parietal regions.

N2  -  Object: The aim of this study was to investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be integrated into functional navigation for the intraoperative visualization of the pyramidal tract. Methods: A single-shot spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner was used for DTI. One null image and six diffusion-weighted,images (high B value 1000 mm/s(2)) were obtained. Color-encoded fractional anisotropy maps of the principal eigenvector rendered as a boxoid within each voxel were used for segmentation of the pyramidal tract. The segmented images were rigidly registered with a T-1-weighted gradient echo 3D dataset for navigation in 16 patients with gliomas. In tumors adjacent to the motor cortex (n = 6) data from functional MR imaging were co-registered. Results: The whole DTI processing lasted about 25-30 minutes in each case. In all cases DTI could be integrated into the navigational dataset resulting in an intraoperative visualization of the pyramidal tract by microscope-based navigation. Navigational accuracy measured as the target registration error was 1.2 +/- 0.46 mm. Registration of fractional anisotropy maps with the 3D navigational dataset was possible with an error of less than 2 mm. Co-registration with fMRI was consistent with DTI data. A neurological deterioration was observed only in one patient. Conclusions: DTI can be reliably integrated into navigational datasets. Thus, microscope-based neuronavigation can be used for an intraoperative visualization of the course of the pyramidal tract. However, a possible shifting of the pyramidal tract has to be taken into account after major tumor parts are removed.

N2  -  The resection of left-sided perisylvian brain lesions harbours the risk of postoperative language impairment. Therefore the individual patient's language distribution is investigated by intraoperative direct cortical stimulation (DCS) during awake surgery. Yet, not all patients qualify for awake surgery. Non-invasive language mapping by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has frequently shown a high correlation in comparison with the results of DCS language mapping in terms of language-negative brain regions. The present study analyses the extent of resection (EOR) and functional outcome of patients who underwent left-sided perisylvian resection of brain lesions based purely on rTMS language mapping.
Four patients with left-sided perisylvian brain lesions (two gliomas WHO III, one glioblastoma, one cavernous angioma) underwent rTMS language mapping prior to surgery. Data from rTMS language mapping and rTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fibre tracking (DTI-FT) were transferred to the intraoperative neuronavigation system. Preoperatively, 5 days after surgery (POD5), and 3 months after surgery (POM3) clinical follow-up examinations were performed.; No patient suffered from a new surgery-related aphasia at POM3. Three patients underwent complete resection immediately, while one patient required a second rTMS-based resection some days later to achieve the final, complete resection.; The present study shows for the first time the feasibility of successfully resecting language-eloquent brain lesions based purely on the results of negative language maps provided by rTMS language mapping and rTMS-based DTI-FT. In very select cases, this technique can provide a rescue strategy with an optimal functional outcome and EOR when awake surgery is not feasible.

N2  -  Object. Preserving vital cerebral function while maximizing tumor resection is a principal goal in surgical neurooncology. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging has been useful in the localization of eloquent cerebral cortex, this method does not provide information about the white matter tracts that may be involved in invasive, intrinsic brain tumors. Recently, diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging techniques have been used to map white matter tracts in the normal brain. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of DT imaging in preoperative mapping of white matter tracts in relation to cerebral neoplasms.
Methods. Nine patients with brain malignancies (one pilocytic astrocytoma, five oligodendrogliomas, one low-grade oligoastrocytoma, one Grade 4 astrocytoma, and one metastatic adenocarcinoma) underwent DT imaging examinations prior to tumor excision. Anatomical information about white matter tract location, orientation, and projections was obtained in every patient. Depending on the tumor type and location, evidence of white matter tract edema (two patients), infiltration (two patients), displacement (five patients), and disruption (two patients) could be assessed with the aid of DT imaging in each case.; Conclusions. Diffusion-tensor imaging allowed for visualization of white matter tracts and was found to be beneficial in the surgical planning for patients with intrinsic brain tumors. The authors' experience with DT imaging indicates that anatomically intact fibers may be present in abnormal-appearing areas of the brain. Whether resection of these involved fibers results in subtle postoperative neurological deficits requires further systematic study.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Within language function research, there is a shift of focus from cortical specialization to a more hodotopical view including subcortical fiber tracts in functional and oncologic considerations. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) is well established to visualize subcortical fiber tracts. Recently, a new technique has been developed using cortical regions mapped via repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as seed regions. This study investigates if rTMS-based DTI FT for language pathways is also feasible postoperatively and whether preoperative versus postoperative fiber changes correlate with changes and severity of the patients' aphasia grades.
METHODS: rTMS-based DTI FT was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 24 patients with left hemispheric perisylvian tumors. Language pathways were analyzed individually preoperatively and postoperatively with 5 different settings of minimum fiber length and fractional anisotropy. Transient aphasia was defined as any new or worse language impairment caused by surgery that resolved within the regular 3-month follow-up interval. Because postoperative aphasia does not allow rTMS language mapping, preoperative rTMS data were used throughout.; RESULTS: Patients with transient aphasia postoperatively had a significant reduction in fiber count compared with patients without deficit (321.5 +- 242.8 fibers vs. 518.0 +- 435.2 fibers; P = 0.01). Furthermore, in this patient group, the arcuate fascicle was lost postoperatively twice as often compared with patients with no deficit after surgery (52% vs. 26%; P < 0.01).; CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rTMS-based DTI FT is feasible for postoperative examination of language pathways. Moreover, changes in preoperative versus postoperative fibers correlate well with the grade of aphasia.

N2  -  Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has recently been introduced as a non-invasive tool for functional mapping of cortical language areas prior to surgery. It correlates well with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) findings, allowing defining the best surgical strategy to preserve cortical language areas during surgery for language-eloquent tumors. Nevertheless, nTMS allows only for cortical mapping and postoperative language deficits are often caused by injury to subcortical language pathways. Nowadays, the only way to preoperatively visualize language subcortical white matter tracts consists in DTI fiber tracking (DTI-I- I). However, standard DTI-FT is based on anatomical landmarks that vary interindividually and can be obscured by the presence of the tumor itself. It has been demonstrated that combining nTMS with DTI-FT allows for a more reliable visualization of the motor pathway in brain tumor patients. Nevertheless, no description about such a combination has been reported for the language network. The aim of the present study is to describe and assess the feasibility and reliability of using cortical seeding areas defined by error type-specific nTMS language mapping (nTMS-positive spots) to perform DTI-I- I in patients affected by language-eloquent brain tumors. We describe a novel technique for a nTMS-based DTI-FT to visualize the complex cortico-subcortical connections of the language network. We analyzed quantitative findings, such as fractional anisotropy values and ratios, and the number of visualized connections of nTMS-positive spots with subcortical pathways, and we compared them with results obtained by using the standard DTI-FT technique. We also analyzed the functional concordance between connected cortical nTMS-positive spots and subcortical pathways, and the likelihood of connection for nTMS-positive vs. nTMS-negative cortical spots. We demonstrated, that the nTMS-based approach, especially what we call the "single-spot" strategy, is able to provide a reliable and more detailed reconstruction of the complex cortico-subcortical language network as compared to the standard DTI-FT. We believe this technique represents a beneficial new strategy for customized preoperative planning in patients affected by tumors in presumed language eloquent location, providing anatomo-functional information to plan language-preserving surgery.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have revealed distinct white matter (WM) characteristics of the brain following diseases. Beyond the lesion-symptom maps, stroke is characterized by extensive structural and functional alterations of brain areas remote to local lesions. Here, we further investigated the structural changes over a global level by using DTI data of 10 ischemic stroke patients showing motor impairment due to basal ganglia lesions and 11 healthy controls. DTI data were processed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and multivariate pattern analysis was used to explore brain regions that play an important role in classification based on FA maps. The WM structural network was constructed by the deterministic fiber-tracking approach. In comparison with the controls, the stroke patients showed FA reductions in the perilesional basal ganglia, brainstem, and bilateral frontal lobes. Using network-based statistics, we found a significant reduction in the WM subnetwork in stroke patients. We identified the patterns of WM degeneration affecting brain areas remote to the lesions, revealing the abnormal organization of the structural network in stroke patients, which may be helpful in understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying hemiplegia.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used extensively to investigate white matter architecture in the brain. In the context of neurological disease, quantification of DTI data sets enables objective characterisation of the associated pathological changes. The aim of this study is to propose a method of evaluating DTI parameter changes in gliomas in the internal capsule using nonlinear registration to delineate the white matter and enable quantitative assessment of DTI derived parameters. 20 patients selected pre-operatively with probable grade 2 or grade 3 glioma on structural MRI along with ten normal volunteers were included in this study. DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were used to define a common segmented FA skeleton that was projected back onto the original individual FA maps. Objective segment classification as normal or abnormal was achieved by comparison to prediction intervals of FA and mean diffusivity (MD) defined in normal subjects. The internal capsules of each patient were segmented into 10 regions of interest (ROI) with 20 and 16 segments across the group having significantly increased or decreased FA and MD values respectively. Seven glioma patients had abnormal DTI parameters in the internal capsule. We show that the classification of tract segments was consistent with disruption, oedema or compression. The results suggest that this method could be used to detect changes in eloquent white matter tracts in individual patients. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is an effective method for characterizing complex neural fiber paths in the human brain. However, visualizing and analyzing the fibers is often challenging because of the complexity of the fiber orientation distribution function used to describe the crossing, kissing, and fanning fibers. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to study brain fiber paths that allows users to explore fiber bundles to reveal the probability of fiber paths using a new visual classification method. First, we use a spherical deconvolution model for diffusion estimation and a Bayesian theorem for fiber tractography. Second, each fiber is subjected to a cluster analysis using pixel-based visual encoding. This result is shown in a pixel-based visual representation where each pixel bar maps opacity, color, and length to the probability, direction, and length of a fiber. Fiber bundles can then be acquired via a two-step classification routine that uses DBSCAN to group fibers based on similarities. Then the user can further refine fiber bundle selection using probabilistic information from the pixel bars. Therefore, the proposed approach shows not only the shape but also the confidence of the fiber paths. We demonstrate the resulting HARDI fiber bundles and compare a brain with tumor and normal brain using our system. Experiments and an empirical user study verify the effectiveness of our approach.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To explore quantitatively and qualitatively how the number of gradient directions (NGD) and spatial resolution (SR) affect diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in patients planned for brain tumor surgery, using routine clinical magnetic resonance imaging protocols.
METHODS: Of 67 patients with intracerebral lesions who had 2 different DTI scans, 3 DTI series were reconstructed to compare the effects of NGD and SR. Tractographies for 4 clinically relevant tracts (corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were constructed with a probabilistic tracking algorithm and automated region of interest placement and compared for 3 quantitative measurements: tract volume, median fiber density, and mean fractional anisotropy, using linear mixed-effects models. The mean tractography volume and intersubject reliability were visually compared across scanning protocols, to assess the clinical relevance of the quantitative differences.; RESULTS: Both NGD and SR significantly influenced tract volume, median fiber density, and mean fractional anisotropy, but not to the same extent. In particular, higher NGD increased tract volume and median fiber density. More importantly, these effects further increased when tracts were affected by disease. The effects were tract specific, but not dependent on threshold. The superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus showed the most significant differences. Qualitative assessment showed larger tract volumes given a fixed confidence level, and better intersubject reliability for the higher NGD protocol. SR in the range we considered seemed less relevant than NGD.; CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that, under time constraints of clinical imaging, a higher number of diffusion gradients is more important than spatial resolution for superior DTI probabilistic tractography in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.

N2  -  Imaging of the course of the corticospinal tract (CST) by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful for function-preserving tumour surgery. The integration of functional localizer data into tracking algorithms offers to establish a direct structure-function relationship in DTI data. However, alterations of MRI signals in and adjacent to brain tumours often lead to spurious tracking results. We here compared the impact of subcortical seed regions placed at different positions and the influences of the somatotopic location of the cortical seed and clinical co-factors on fibre tracking plausibility in brain tumour patients.
The CST of 32 patients with intracranial tumours was investigated by means of deterministic DTI and neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). The cortical seeds were defined by the nTMS hot spots of the primary motor area (M1) of the hand, the foot and the tongue representation. The CST originating from the contralesional M1 hand area was mapped as intra-individual reference. As subcortical region of interests (ROI), we used the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) andor the anterior inferior pontine region (aiP). The plausibility of the fibre trajectories was assessed by a-priori defined anatomical criteria. The following potential co-factors were analysed: Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), resting motor threshold (RMT), T1-CE tumour volume, T2 oedema volume, presence of oedema within the PLIC, the fractional anisotropy threshold (FAT) to elicit a minimum amount of fibres and the minimal fibre length.; The results showed a higher proportion of plausible fibre tracts for the aiP-ROI compared to the PLIC-ROI. Low FAT values and the presence of peritumoural oedema within the PLIC led to less plausible fibre tracking results. Most plausible results were obtained when the FAT ranged above a cut-off of 0.105. In addition, there was a strong effect of somatotopic location of the seed ROI; best plausibility was obtained for the contralateral hand CST (100%), followed by the ipsilesional hand CST (>95%), the ipsilesional foot (>85%) and tongue (>75%) CST. In summary, we found that the aiP-ROI yielded better tracking results compared to the IC-ROI when using deterministic CST tractography in brain tumour patients, especially when the M1 hand area was tracked. In case of FAT values lower than 0.10, the result of the respective CST tractography should be interpreted with caution with respect to spurious tracking results. Moreover, the presence of oedema within the internal capsule should be considered a negative predictor for plausible CST tracking. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Brain lesions are usually located adjacent to critical spinal structures, so it is a challenging task for neurosurgeons to precisely plan a surgical procedure without damaging healthy tissues and nerves. The advancement of medical imaging technologies produces a large amount of neurological data, which are capable of showing a wide variety of brain properties. Advanced algorithms of medical data computing and visualization are critically helpful in efficiently utilizing the acquired data for disease diagnosis and brain function and structure exploration, which is helpful for treatment planning. In this paper, we describe new algorithms and a software framework for multiple volume of interest specified diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber dynamic visualization. The displayed results have been integrated with a volume rendering pipeline for multimodality neurological data exploration. A depth texture indexing algorithm is used to detect DTI fiber tracts in graphics process units (GPUs), which makes fibers to be displayed and interactively manipulated with brain data acquired from functional magnetic resonance imaging, T-1- and T-2- weighted anatomic imaging, and angiographic imaging. The developed software platform is built on an object-oriented structure, which is transparent and extensible. It provides a comprehensive human-computer interface for data exploration and information extraction. The GPU-accelerated high-performance computing kernels have been implemented to enable our software to dynamically visualize neurological data. The developed techniques will be useful in computer-aided neurological disease diagnosis, brain structure exploration, and general cognitive neuroscience.

N2  -  Angiostrongylus cantonensis has become a global source of infection in recent years, and the differential diagnosis and timely follow-up are crucial in the management of the infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a non-invasive technique in characterizing and localizing lesions during the parasitic infections in the brain. Non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to distinguish microscopic cerebral structures but cannot resolve the more complicated neural structure. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation. One such method, generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), can be applied to a variety of datasets, including the single shell, multi-shell or grid sampling schemes, which are believed to resolve complicated crossing fibers. This study aimed to characterize angiostrongyliasis in the rabbit brain over a 6-week period using anatomical and diffusion MRI, including DTI and GQI. Our anatomical T2WI and R2 mapping results showed that the ventricle size of the rabbit brain increased after A. cantonensis larvae infection, and the DTI and GQI indices both showed pathological changes in the corpus callosum, hippocampus and cortex over a 6-week infection period. These results were consistent with our histopathological findings. Our results demonstrated that the diagnosis of larvae infection using anatomical and diffusion MRI is possible and that follow-up characterization is informative in revealing the effects of angiostrongyliasis in various brain areas. These support the use of anatomical and diffusion MRI was helpful for diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis infection. This non-invasive MRI platform could be used to improve the management of eosinophilic meningitis or eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The clinical usefulness of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the pyramidal tract was evaluated in patients with brain tumors. Five normal volunteers and seven patients with glioma (n = 4) or meningioma (n = 3) near the pyramidal tract underwent coronal echo planar DWI. Greyscale DWIs in each of the three orthogonal diffusion gradients were transformed into graduations, color-coded as red, green or blue, respectively, and then composited to form a combined color image. The entire pyramidal tract was visualized on a single fiber mapping image by combining the upper half of the image slice including the primary motor cortex, the corona radiata and the internal capsule with the lower half of the image slice including the internal capsule, the cerebral peduncle and the ventral brain stem. Fiber mapping images demonstrated the pyramidal tract as a distinct band indicating nerve fiber integrity in all volunteers. The entire pyramidal tract from the primary motor subcortex to the ventral brain stem could be traced. Fiber mapping images showed the ipsilateral pyramidal tract as either discontinuous due to impaired anisotropy or compressed due to mass effect in patients with brain tumors. These findings corresponded well with the pre- and postoperative motor functions. Fiber mapping images are useful for evaluating the white matter neuronal tracts and can provide indications for determining surgical strategy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) infers the trajectory and location of large white matter tracts by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water. DTI data may then be analyzed and presented as tractography for visualization of the tracts in 3 dimensions. Despite the important information contained in tractography images, usefulness for neurosurgical planning has been limited by the inability to define which are critical structures within the mass of demonstrated fibers and to clarify their relationship to the tumor.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to allow the interactive querying of tractography data sets for surgical planning and to provide a working software package for the research community.; METHODS: The tool was implemented within an open source software project. Echoplanar DTI at 3 T was performed on 5 patients, followed by tensor calculation. Software was developed that allowed the placement of a dynamic seed point for local selection of fibers and for fiber display around a segmented structure, both with tunable parameters. A neurosurgeon was trained in the use of software in, 1 hour and used it to review cases.; RESULTS: Tracts near tumor and critical structures were interactively visualized in 3 dimensions to determine spatial relationships to lesion. Tracts were selected using 3 methods: anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging-defined regions of interest, distance from the segmented tumor volume, and dynamic seed-point spheres.; CONCLUSION: Interactive tractography successfully enabled inspection of white matter structures that were in proximity to lesions, critical structures, and functional cortical areas, allowing the surgeon to explore the relationships between them.

N2  -  Background: Surgery of brain tumors has made excellent progresses over time. Its characteristic is to be an extremely invasive surgery, becoming a limit that neurosurgeons have tried to overcome with the discovery of more and more modern diagnostic tools.
Aim: In brain tumor surgery the aim is to excise the tumor without creating superior function deficits, so try to spare the so-called eloquent areas. Since the early twentieth century, neurosurgeons like Penfield and Ojemann have paid attention to the preservation of the language areas as well as of the motor pathways during brain surgery.; Methods and results: Cortical electrical stimulation and brain mapping were used with good results. The problem was for a long time the invasiveness of the surgery which however foresaw a craniotomy. A few years ago a new and revolutionary technique has established itself. The diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive method that includes the use of MRI, allowing the study of white matter and therefore of the cortico-spinal tracts. Then, DTI tractography is able to distinguish normal nerve fibers from those infiltrated by the tumor, detecting pathological features of white matter such as axonal damage, ischemia, inflammation, edema.; Conclusions: The literature is rich in cases related to the use of DTI in brain tumors, the results are excellent if one thinks of the saving of functionally important brain areas. Therefore, the excision of malignant tumors such as gliomas and glioblastomas is followed by a different and better outcome and a different quality of life. DTI tractography today represents the best and safest way of preserving the superior cortical functions in brain tumor surgery.

N2  -  Objective There is a pressing need to assess user-dependent reproducibility of multi-fibre probabilistic tractography in order to encourage clinical implementation of these advanced and relevant approaches. The goal of this study was to evaluate both intrinsic and inter-user reproducibility of corticospinal tract estimation. Materials and methods Six clinical datasets including motor functional and diffusion MRI were used. Three users performed an independent tractography analysis following identical instructions. Dice indices were calculated to quantify the reproducibility of seed region, fMRI-based end region, and streamline maps. Results The inter-user reproducibility ranged 41-93%, 29-94%, and 50-92%, for seed regions, end regions, and streamline maps, respectively. Differences in streamline maps correlated with differences in seed and end regions. Good inter-user agreement in seed and end regions, yielded inter-user reproducibility close to the intrinsic reproducibility (92-97%) and in most cases higher than 80%. Discussion Uncertainties related to user-dependent decisions and the probabilistic nature of the analysis should be considered when interpreting probabilistic tractography data. The standardization of the methods used to define seed and end regions is a necessary step to improve the accuracy and robustness of multi-fiber probabilistic tractography in a clinical setting. Clinical users should choose a feasible compromise between reproducibility and analysis duration.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows in vivo delineation of brainstem white matter tracts. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not abnormalities of DTI metrics and fiber tractography correlate with neurological deficits and clinical status in patients with primary posterior fossa tumors.
METHODS: A review of patients with primary posterior fossa tumors who underwent magnetic resonance imaging with DTI was performed. Patients were stratified by tumor type (well-circumscribed or infiltrating lesions). Fractional anisotropy (FA) color maps were used to localize the corticospinal tracts within the brainstem. FA, mean diffusivity, and eigenvalues were measured. Tractography was performed. Correlations between DTI metrics and clinical status and between DTI metrics and neurological examination findings were assessed within each patient group using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of DTI metrics were also made between patient groups (infiltrating lesions versus well-circumscribed lesions).; RESULTS: Thirty patients were studied (mean age, 14.1 yr; 16 male, 14 female). Eighteen patients had infiltrating lesions and 12 had well-circumscribed lesions. Twelve patients (four well-circumscribed and eight infiltrating) demonstrated motor weakness on physical examination (four right, three left, five bilateral). Patients with well-circumscribed lesions and weakness had higher mean diffusivity and lower FA in the contralateral corticospinal tract (P < 0.05). No such association was seen in patients with infiltrating tumors. In 102 total patient-years of follow-up (average follow-up period, 4.2 yr), 17 patients (six well circumscribecl and 11 infiltrating lesions) demonstrated complete response or stable disease and six patients (three well-circumscribed and three infiltrating lesions) demonstrated progressive disease or death. No differences were seen in terms of DTI metrics between patients with infiltrating lesions and those with well-circumscribed lesions. Patients with well-circumscribed tumors and a bad outcome had significantly lower transverse eigenvalue measures in the corticospinal tracts compared with those with a more favorable clinical status (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSION: In patients with well-circumscribed primary posterior fossa masses, higher mean diffusivity and lower FA in the brainstem corticospinal tract are associated with contralateral motor deficits; lower transverse eigenvalue may be observed with an unfavorable clinical outcome.

N2  -  Visualization of functionally significant subcortical white matter fibers is needed in neurosurgical procedures in order to avoid damage to the language network during resection. In an effort to achieve this, positive cortical points revealed during preoperative language mapping with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) can be employed as regions of interest (ROIs) for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking. However, the effect that the use of different language tasks has on nTMS mapping and subsequent DTI-fiber tracking remains unexplored. The visualization of ventral stream tracts with an assumed lexico-semantic role may especially benefit from ROIs delivered by the lexico-semantically demanding verb task, Action Naming. In a first step, bihemispheric nTMS language mapping was administered in 18 healthy participants using the standard task Object Naming and the novel task Action Naming to trigger verbs in a small sentence context. Cortical areas in which nTMS induced language errors were identified as language-positive cortical sites. In a second step, nTMS-based DTI-fiber tracking was conducted using solely these language-positive points as ROIs. The ability of the two tasks' ROIs to visualize the dorsal tracts Arcuate Fascicle and Superior Longitudinal Fascicle, the ventral tracts Inferior Longitudinal Fascicle, Uncinate Fascicle, and Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle, the speech-articulatory Cortico-Nuclear Tract, and interhemispheric commissural fibers was compared in both hemispheres. In the left hemisphere, ROIs of Action Naming led to a significantly higher fraction of overall visualized tracts, specifically in the ventral stream's Inferior Fronto-Occipital and Inferior Longitudinal Fascicle. No difference was found between tracking with Action Naming vs. Object Naming seeds for dorsal stream tracts, neither for the speech-articulatory tract nor the inter-hemispheric connections. While the two tasks appeared equally demanding for phonological-articulatory processes, ROI seeding through the task Action Naming seemed to better visualize lexico-semantic tracts in the ventral stream. This distinction was not evident in the right hemisphere. However, the distribution of tracts exposed was, overall, mirrored relative to those in the left hemisphere network. In presurgical practice, mapping and tracking of language pathways may profit from these findings and should consider inclusion of the Action Naming task, particularly for lesions in ventral subcortical regions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: For neuroepithelial tumors, the surgical goal is maximum resection with preservation of neurological function. This is contributed to by intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) combined with multimodal navigation.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the contribution of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber tracking of language pathways with 2 different algorithms (tensor deflection, connectivity analysis CA) integrated in the navigation on the surgical outcome.; METHODS: We evaluated 32 patients with neuroepithelial tumors who underwent surgery with DTI-based fiber tracking of language pathways integrated in neuronavigation. The tensor deflection algorithm was routinely used and its results intraoperatively displayed in all cases. The CA algorithm was furthermore evaluated in 23 cases. Volumetric assessment was performed in pre- and intraoperative MR images. To evaluate the benefit of fiber tractography, language deficits were evaluated pre-and postoperatively and compared with the volumetric analysis.; RESULTS: Final gross-total resection was performed in 40.6% of patients. Absolute tumor volume was reduced from 55.33 +- 63.77 cm(3) to 20.61 +- 21.67 cm(3) in first iMRI resection control, to finally 11.56 +- 21.92 cm(3) (P < .01). Fiber tracking of the 2 algorithms showed a deviation of the displayed 3D objects by <5 mm. In long-term follow-up only 1 patient (3.1%) had a persistent language deficit.; CONCLUSION: Intraoperative visualization of language-related cortical areas and the connecting pathways with DTI-based fiber tracking can be successfully performed and integrated in the navigation system. In a setting of intraoperative high-field MRI this contributes to maximum tumor resection with low postoperative morbidity.

N2  -  The spatial complexity of highly vulnerable structures makes surgical resection of brainstem cavernomas (BSC) a challenging procedure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows for the visualization of white matter tracts and enables a better understanding of the anatomical location of corticospinal and sensory tracts before and after surgery.We investigated the feasibility and clinical usefulness of DTI-based fiber tractography in patients with BSC.Pre- and postoperative DTI visualization of corticospinal and sensory tracts were retrospectively analyzed in 23 individuals with BSC. Preoperative and postoperative DTI-fiber accuracy were associated to the neurological findings. Preoperatively, the corticospinal tracts were visualized in 90 % of the cases and the sensory tracts were visualized in 74 % of the cases. Postoperatively, the corticospinal tracts were visualized in 97 % of the cases and the sensory tracts could be visualized in 80 % of the cases. In all cases, the BSC had caused displacement, thinning, or interruption of the fiber tracts to various degrees. Tract visualization was associated with pre- and postoperative neurological findings. Postoperative damage of the corticospinal tracts was observed in two patients. On follow-up, the Patzold Rating (PR) improved in 19 out of 23 patients (83 %, p = 0.0002).This study confirms that DTI tractography allows accurate and detailed white matter tract visualization in the brainstem, even when an intraaxial lesion affects this structure. Furthermore, visualizing the tracts adjacent to the lesion adds to our understanding of the distorted intrinsic brainstem anatomy and it may assists in planning the surgical approach in specific cases.

N2  -  New guidelines for the diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) represent an important step in the definition of this clinical entity. These guidelines still remain vague in the definition of "vascular" brain lesions causing cognitive decline, because longitudinal correlative imaging studies are still scarce. In this review we explore which abnormalities are likely to contribute to VCI based on a proven vascular etiology, fast progression and their incidence or progression being related to cognitive decline. Among focal changes visible on standard MRI these features apply for coalescent white matter changes. The evidence for lacunes and microbleeds is much less convincing. Microstructural alterations in normal appearing brain tissue which can be detected by new MRI techniques such as magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high resolution MR appear to better correlate with cognitive decline, but the etiology of these changes and their histopathological correlates is still incompletely understood as is their evolution over time. New multimodal image processing such as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) or combinations of DTI and voxel-based analysis will allow to allocate the lesion patterns that show the greatest covariance with clinical outcome. Such data and more longitudinal correlative data on lacunes and microbleeds will increase our pathophysiologic understanding of VCI including the interplay with primary degenerative processes and will lead to refinement of current VCI criteria.

N2  -  We report our preliminary series of patients treated for lesions involving the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract in BrainSuite, with intraoperative MRI, tractography and "neuronavigated" electrophysiological cortical and subcortical mapping. An exact localization of the cortical and subcortical functional areas is mandatory for executing surgery of intra-parenchymal neoplasm involving the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract. Nowadays modern technology offers a variety of tools to reduce as much as possible postoperative deficits during surgery of cerebral eloquent areas. From December 2008 and June 2010, 18 patients underwent functional surgery, for neoplasm involving the motor cortex and/or the subcortical pathway, in BrainSuite. Our preliminary series include 14 gliomas and 4 metastases; Table 1 summarizes all of the data. We included in this series patients with complete removal of lesions of eloquent areas with an average distance from the corticospinal tract of 4 mm. Six neoplasms were considered in contact and/or involving the motor cortex, while in 18 cases (100%) the tumour involved eloquent areas concerning the corticospinal tract. All of the patients underwent complete removal of the lesion as subsequently demonstrated by intraoperative postsurgical MRI. Our series highlights the good integration and the high compatibility between BrainSUITE with 1.5 T intraoperative magnetic field and neurophysiological monitoring. We strongly believe that intraoperative MRI with DTI allows us to treat complex surgery tumours that without its auxilium we would not be able to deal with.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Preserving the facial nerve (FN) during surgery for large vestibular schwannomas (VSs) is challenging because of the unpredictable locations and morphologic changes in the FN. Diffusion tensor imaginge based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) has been proposed to pre-operatively visualize the FN. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of DTI-FT for predicting FN location and shape in patients with large VSs.
METHODS: In this prospective study, imaging data from 30 consecutive patients with large VSs were obtained using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. The DTI-FT results included the location of the reconstructed FN relative to the tumor, and maximal fractional anisotropy (MFA) threshold values for FN tracking were determined with iPlan software. Intraoperative findings including the location of FN relative to the tumor and shape were determined by microscopic observations and electrophysiologic monitoring. A correlation analysis was performed between the DTI-FT results and intraoperative findings.; RESULTS: Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTIFT was successful in all 30 patients. The location of the cisternal segment of the FN in relation to the tumors predicted by DTI-FT was consistent with the intraoperative findings in 29 (96.7%) of the 30 patients. The area under the curve of MFA for differentiation between the compact and flat FN was 0.84 (95% confidence interval CI: 0.69-0.98) (P = 0.002).; CONCLUSIONS: DTI-FT with modified tracking settings was useful to pre-operatively predict the location of FN in patients with large VSs. The MFA of FN demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance for distinguishing compact from flat FNs.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking (FT) has been widely used in glioma surgery in recent years. It can provide helpful information about subcortical structures, especially in patients with eloquent space-occupying lesions. This study compared the newly developed navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS)-based DTI FT of language pathways with the most reproducible protocol for language pathway tractography, using cubic regions of interest (ROls) for the arcuate fascicle.
METHODS Thirty-seven patients with left-sided perisylvian lesions underwent language mapping by repetitive nTMS. DTI FT was performed using the cubic ROls based protocol and the authors' nTMS-based DTI FT approach. The same minimal fiber length and fractional anisotropy were chosen (50 mm and 0.2, respectively). Both protocols were performed with standard clinical tractography software.; RESULTS Both methods visualized language-related fiber tracts (i.e., corticonuclear tract, arcuate fascicle, uncinate fascicle, superior longitudinal fascicle, inferior longitudinal fascicle, arcuate fibers, commissural fibers, corticothalamic fibers, and frontooccipital fascicle) in all 37 patients. Using the cubic ROls-based protocol, 39.9% of these language related fiber tracts were detected in the examined patients, as opposed to 76.0% when performing nTMS-based DTI FT. For specifically tracking the arcuate fascicle, however, the cubic ROls-based approach showed better results (97.3% vs 75.7% with nTMS-based DTI FT).; CONCLUSIONS The cubic ROls-based protocol was designed for arcuate fascicle tractography, and this study shows that it is still useful for this intention. However, superior results were obtained using the nTMS-based DTI FT for visualization of other language-related fiber tracts.

N2  -  The key component of a microstructural diffusion MRI 'super-scanner' is a dedicated high-strength gradient system that enables stronger diffusion weightings per unit time compared to conventional gradient designs. This can, in turn, drastically shorten the time needed for diffusion encoding, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and facilitate measurements at shorter diffusion times. This review, written from the perspective of the UK National Facility for In Vivo MR Imaging of Human Tissue Microstructure, an initiative to establish a shared 300 mT/m-gradient facility amongst the microstructural imaging community, describes ten advantages of ultra-strong gradients for microstructural imaging. Specifically, we will discuss how the increase of the accessible measurement space compared to a lower-gradient systems (in terms of Delta, b-value, and TE) can accelerate developments in the areas of 1) axon diameter distribution mapping; 2) microstructural parameter estimation; 3) mapping micro-vs macroscopic anisotropy features with gradient waveforms beyond a single pair of pulsed-gradients; 4) multi-contrast experiments, e.g. diffusion-relaxometry; 5) tractography and high-resolution imaging in vivo and 6) post mortem; 7) diffusion-weighted spectroscopy of metabolites other than water; 8) tumour characterisation; 9) functional diffusion MRI; and 10) quality enhancement of images acquired on lower-gradient systems. We finally discuss practical barriers in the use of ultra-strong gradients, and provide an outlook on the next generation of 'super-scanners'.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) is used to visualize subcortical fiber tracts. Yet, there is no standard at hand to visualize language-involved subcortical fibers reliably. Thus, this study investigates the feasibility of using language-related cortical areas identified via repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to seed DTI FT of subcortical language tracts. From 2011 to 2014, 37 patients with left-hemispheric perisylvian lesions were examined. Language-positive rTMS stimulation spots were integrated in the deterministic tractography software (BrainLAB, iPlanNet 3.0) as objects and used as seed regions for DTI FT. Tractography was then performed in each patient with 77 different combinations of fiber lengths (40 - 100 mm) and fractional anisotropy (FA; 0.01 - 0.5). The rTMS-based DTI FT identified all commonly known subcortical language tracts, such as the corticonuclear tract, arcuate fascicle, uncinate fascicle, superior longitudinal fascicle, inferior longitudinal fascicle, arcuate fibers, commissural fibers, corticothalamic fibers, and the fronto-occipital fascicle. In 32 patients (86.5 %), each above-named tract could be visualized, while at least 6 out of these 9 tracts were identified in each patient. A fiber length of 100 mm and an FA of 0.1 or 0.15 provided optimal visualization by revealing 125 and 61 individually tracked fibers per visualized language tract and 90 % and 73 % of all language-related tracts, respectively. This study proves the feasibility of rTMS-based DTI FT for subcortical language tracts, provides suitable settings, and shows its easy and standardizable application for the visualization of every language tract in 86.5 % of patients.

N2  -  Aim: To evaluate the author's experience with the use of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) on patients with glial tumors.
Methods: A retrospective evaluation of a group of 24 patients with glial tumors was performed. There were eight patients with Grade II, eight patients with Grade III, eight patients with Grade IV tumors with a histologically proven diagnosis. All the patients underwent routine imaging including T2 weighted images, multidirectional diffusion weighted imaging (measured in 60 non-collinear directions) and T1 weighted non-enhanced and contrast enhanced images. The imaging sequence and evaluation software were produced by Massachusetts General Hospital Corporation (Boston, MA, USA). Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated in all patients. The white matter FA changes were assessed within the tumorous tissue, on the tumorous borderline and in the normally appearing white matter adjacent to the tumor. A three-dimensional model of the white matter tract was created to demonstrate the space relationship of the tumor and the capsula interna or corpus callosum in each case using the following fiber tracing parameters: FA step 0.25 and a tensor declination angle of 45 gr. An additional assessment of the tumorous tissue enhancement was performed.; Results: A uniform homogenous structure with sharp demargination of the Grade II tumors and the wide rim of the intermedial FA in all Grade III tumors respectively, were found during the evaluation of the FA maps. In Grade IV tumors a variable demargination was noted on the FA maps. The sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination of low- and high-grade glial tumors using FA maps was revealed to be 81% and 87% respectively. If the evaluation of the contrast enhancement was combined with the evaluation of the FA maps, both sensitivity and specificity were 100%.; Conclusion: Although the evaluation of the fractional anisotropy maps is not sufficient for glioma grading, the combination of the contrast enhancement pattern and fractional anisotropy maps evaluation improves the possibility of distinguishing low- and high-grade glial tumors. Three-dimensional models of the white matter fibers in the corpus callosum and the internal capsule may be used in the presurgical planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Small size and intricate anatomical environment are the main difficulties facing tractography of the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex (FVN), and lead to challenges in fiber orientation distribution (FOD) modeling, fiber tracking, region-of-interest selection, and fiber filtering. Experts need rich experience in anatomy and tractography, as well as substantial labor costs, to identify the FVN. Thus, we present a pipeline to identify the FVN automatically, in what we believe is the first study of the automated identification of the FVN. First, we created an FVN template. Forty high-resolution multishell data were used to perform data-driven fiber clustering based on the multishell multitissue constraint spherical deconvolution FOD model and deterministic tractography. We selected the brainstem and cerebellum (BS-CB) region as the seed region and removed the fibers that reach other brain regions. We then performed spectral fiber clustering twice. The first clustering was to create a BS-CB atlas and separate the fibers that pass through the cerebellopontine angle, and the other one was to extract the FVN. Second, we registered the subject-specific fibers in the space of the FVN template and assigned each fiber to the closest cluster to identify the FVN automatically by spectral embedding. We applied the proposed method to different acquirement sites, including two different healthy datasets and two tumor patient datasets. Experimental results showed that our automatic identification results have ideal colocalization with expert manual identification in terms of spatial overlap and visualization. Importantly, we successfully applied our method to tumor patient data. The FVNs identified by the proposed method were in agreement with intraoperative findings.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now used not only for delineating white matter fiber tracts, but also for assessing the histological characteristics of pathological tissues. Among these uses, predicting the extent or existence of tumor cell invasion into white matter by DTI is under extensive investigation. The previously reported tumor infiltration index (TII) holds great potential for the discrimination of pure vasogenic edema from tumor-infiltrated edema. However, conflicting data are being reported questioning the clinical value of TII. The present investigation reevaluated the utility of TII in patients with meningioma or glioma. We found that TII was unable to discriminate vasogenic from tumor-infiltrated edema. Conversely, detailed voxel-by-voxel comparison of TII and C-11-methionie PET in the T2-hyperintense area of gliomas showed that TII and C-11-methionie PET has a positive correlation, suggesting that, although TII is unable to discriminate the cause of edema, the extent of tumor cell invasion into white matter is depicted in gliomas by TII. These data suggest that TII involves both vasogenic and tumor-infiltrated factors, rather than only a single factor. A more intensive investigation is required to reach a complete understanding of TII.

N2  -  The localization of tumors and epileptogenic foci within the somatosensory or language cortex of the brain of a child poses unique neurosurgical challenges. In the past, lesions in these regions were not treated aggressively for fear of inducing neurological deficits. As a result, while function may have been preserved, the underlying disease may not have been optimally treated, and repeat neurosurgical procedures were frequently required. Today, with the advent of preoperative brain mapping, image guidance or neuronavigation, and intraoperative monitoring, peri-Rolandic and language cortex lesions can be approached directly and definitively with a high degree of confidence that neurosurgical function will be maintained.
The preoperative brain maps can now be achieved with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, magnetoencephalography, and diffusion tensor imaging. Image guidance systems have improved significantly and include the use of the intraoperative MRI. Somatosensory, motor, and brainstem auditory-evoked potentials are used as standard neuromonitoring techniques in many centers around the world. Added to this now is the use of continuous train-of-five monitoring of the integrity of the corticospinal tract while operating in the peri-Rolandic region.; We are in an era where continued advancements can be expected in mapping additional pathways such as visual, memory, and hearing pathways. With these new advances, neurosurgeons can expect to significantly improve their surgical outcomes further.

N2  -  Peritumoral edema prevents fiber tracking from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). A free-water correction may overcome this drawback, as illustrated in the case of a patient undergoing awake surgery for brain metastasis. The anatomical plausibility and accuracy of tractography with and without free-water correction were assessed with functional mapping and axono-cortical evoked-potentials (ACEPs) as reference methods. The results suggest a potential synergy between corrected DTI-based tractography and ACEPs to reliably identify and preserve white matter tracts during brain tumor surgery.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate fiber density mapping (FDM) in the quantification of the extent of destruction of white matter (WM) structures in the center, transition zone, and border zone of intracranial gliomas.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided biopsies were performed in 20 patients with glioma. FDM is a three-step approach that includes diagonalization of the diffusion tensor, fiber reconstruction for the whole brain, and calculation of fiber density values. Coregistration of FDM data with MR imaging data used for stereotactic biopsy guidance enabled us to correlate these results with histopathologic findings. Data were analyzed by using regression analyses and Hoetelling-Williams and Wilcoxon signed rank tests.; Results: Histopathologic correlation revealed strong negative correlations with both the logarithm of tumor cell number (CN) (R = -0.825) and the percentage of tumor infiltration (TI) (R = -0.909). Complete destruction of WM structures was found when the percentage of TI was 60% or greater and when the tumor CN was 150 or greater. We estimated a fi ber density value of 18 as a limit in the identification of fi ber structures that are infiltrated with tumor yet are still potentially functional.; Conclusion: FDM provides histologic insight into the structure of WM; therefore, it may help prevent posttreatment neurologic deficits when planning therapy of brain tumors.

N2  -  Objective: Up to now, fiber tractography in the clinical routine is mostly based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are known drawbacks in the resolution of crossing or kissing fibers and in the vicinity of a tumor or edema. These restrictions can be overcome by tractography based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) which in turn requires larger numbers of gradients resulting in longer acquisition times. Using compressed sensing (CS) techniques, HARDI signals can be obtained by using less non-collinear diffusion gradients, thus enabling the use of HARDI-based fiber tractography in the clinical routine.
Methods: Eight patients with gliomas in the temporal lobe, in proximity to the optic radiation (OR), underwent 3T MRI including a diffusion-weighted dataset with 30 gradient directions. Fiber tractography of the OR using a deterministic streamline algorithm based on DTI was compared to tractography based on reconstructed diffusion signals using HARDI+CS.; Results: HARDI+CS based tractography displayed the OR more conclusively compared to the DTI-based results in all eight cases. In particular, the potential of HARDI+CS-based tractography was observed for cases of high grade gliomas with significant peritumoral edema, larger tumor size or closer proximity of tumor and reconstructed fiber tract.; Conclusions: Overcoming the problem of long acquisition times, HARDI+CS seems to be a promising basis for fiber tractography of the OR in regions of disturbed diffusion, areas of high interest in glioma surgery.

N2  -  Recently, a fiber visualization method for high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was proposed using a multiple-kernel line integral convolution (LIC) algorithm and an anisotropic spot pattern. This processing routine leads to high contrast color-coded LIC maps that are capable of visualizing local anisotropy information and regional fiber architecture. In this paper, we evaluate and validate this method by applying it to simulated datasets and to in vivo diffusion MRI data of children and adults with different disease conditions and healthy volunteers. Compared to routine clinical fiber visualization (color-coded fractional anisotropy, FA maps, and fiber tractography), it has the advantage of visualizing complex local fiber architecture in a fully automated way. The results indicate that this method is capable of reliably delineating normal fiber architecture and fibers infiltrated, displaced, or disrupted by lesions and is therefore a promising tool in the clinical context.

N2  -  Objective: The present study aims to investigate the relationship between transcallosal interhemispheric connectivity (IC) and hemispheric language lateralization by using a novel approach including repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), hemispheric dominance ratio (HDR) calculation, and rTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT).
Methods: 31 patients with left-sided perisylvian brain lesions underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rTMS language mapping. Cortical language-positive rTMS spots were used to calculate HDRs (HDR: quotient of the left-sided divided by right-sided naming error rates for corresponding left- and right sided cortical regions) and to create regions of interest (ROIs) for DTI FT. Then, fibers connecting the rTMS-based ROIs of both hemispheres were tracked, and the correlation of IC to HDRs was calculated via Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)).; Results: Fibers connecting rTMS-based ROIs of both hemispheres were detected in 12 patients (38.7%). Within the patients in which IC was detected, the mean number of subcortical IC fibers standard deviation (SD) was 138.0 +- 346.5 (median: 7.5; range: 1-1,217 fibers). Regarding rs for the correlation of HDRs and fiber numbers of patients that showed IC, only moderate correlation was revealed.; Conclusion: Our approach might be beneficial and technically feasible for further investigation of the relationship between IC and language lateralization. However, only moderate correlation was revealed in the present study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  In diffusion MRI, the advent of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and HARDI with compressed sensing (HARDI+CS) has led to clinically practical signal acquisition techniques which allow for the assessment of white matter architecture in routine patient studies. However, the reconstruction and visualization of fiber pathways by tractography has not yet been established as a standard methodology which can easily be applied. This is due to various algorithmic problems, such as a lack of robustness, error propagation and the necessity of fine-tuning parameters depending on the clinical question. In the framework of a clinical study of glioma patients, we compare two different whole-brain tracking methods to a local connectivity mapping approach which has recently shown promising results in an adaptation to diffusion MRI. The ability of the three methods to correctly depict fiber affection is analyzed by comparing visualization results to representations of local diffusion profiles provided by orientation distribution functions (ODFs). Our results suggest that methods beyond fiber tractography, which visualize local connectedness rather than global connectivity, should be evaluated further for pre-surgical assessment of fiber affection.

N2  -  A noninvasive technique for assessing tumor tissue characteristics is required to assist preoperative surgical planning for malignant brain tumors. Preoperative information on tumor cell density within a tumor would help better define the target for tumor biopsy, resulting in more accurate diagnosis and grading of malignant brain tumors. One possible source of this information is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), although to date studies have focused on its ability to delineate white matter fiber tracks by fiber-tracking and to detect tumor infiltration around the tumor and normal white matter interface.
However, the use of DTI for providing information on cell density has also been examined, although with the controversial results. In addition the exact relationships between cell density and the two key values that DTI provides, namely fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MID), still need to be investigated. In the present study we performed a retrospective investigation of tumor cell density and FA and MD values in biopsy cases. We found that FA has a good positive correlation (R=0.75) and MD has a good negative correlation (R=0.70) with tumor cell density within the tumor core. Similar correlation was observed between the Ki-67 labeling index and FA (R=0.71) and MD (R=0.62).; Thus, measurement of both FA and MD within the tumor core has a potential to provide detailed information on tumor cell density within the tumor. Although data obtained from DTI should be interpreted carefully and comprehensively with other imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography, DTI seems to be informative for planning the best biopsy target containing the highest cell density.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in brain tumor resection has been limited in part by a perceived difficulty in implementing the techniques into neurosurgical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a simple DTI postprocessing method performed without a neuroscientist and to share results in preserving patient function while aggressively resecting tumors.; METHODS: DTI data are obtained in all patients with tumors located within presumed eloquent cortices. Relevant white matter tracts are mapped and integrated with neuronavigation by a nonexpert in < 20 minutes. We report operative results in 43 consecutive awake craniotomy patients from January 2014 to December 2014 undergoing resection of intracranial lesions. We compare DTI-expected findings with stimulation mapping results for the corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus.; RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (65%) underwent surgery for high-grade gliomas and 11 patients (26%) for low-grade gliomas. Seventeen patients had posterior temporal lesions; 10 had posterior frontal lesions; 8 had parietal-temporal-occipital junction lesions; and 8 had insular lesions. With DTI-defined tracts used as a guide, a combined 65 positive maps and 60 negative maps were found via stimulation mapping. Overall sensitivity and specificity of DTI were 98% and 95%, respectively. Permanent speech worsening occurred in 1 patient (2%), and permanent weakness occurred in 3 patients (7%). Greater than 90% resection was achieved in 32 cases (74%).; CONCLUSION: Accurate DTI is easily obtained, postprocessed, and implemented into neuronavigation within routine neurosurgical workflow. This information aids in resecting tumors while preserving eloquent cortices and subcortical networks.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Fiber tractography (FT) has become an important noninvasive tool to ensure maximal safe tumor resection in eloquent glioma surgery. Intraoperatively applied FT is still predominantly based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, reconstruction schemes of high angular resolution diffusion imaging data for high-resolution FT (HRFT) are gaining increasing attention. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the accuracy of sophisticated HRFT models compared with DTI-FT.
METHODS: Ten patients with eloquent gliomas underwent surgery under awake craniotomy conditions. The localization of acquisition points, representing deteriorations during intraoperative electrostimulation (IOM) and neuropsychological mapping, were documented. The offsets of acquisition points to the respective fiber bundle were calculated. Probabilistic U-ball imaging (QBI) and constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-FT were compared with DTI-FT for the major language-associated fiber bundles (superior longitudinal fasciculus SLF II-IV, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculusmedial longitudinal fasciculus).; RESULTS: Among 186 offset values, 46% were located closer than 10 mm to the estimated fiber bundle (CSD, 36%; DTI, 40% and QBI, 60%). Moreover, only 10 offsets were further away than 30 mm (5%). Lowest mean minimum offsets (SLF, 7.7 +- 7.9 mm; inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, 12.7 +- 8.3 mm; inferior longitudinal fasciculusmedial longitudinal fasciculus, 17.7 +- 6.7 mm) were found for OBI, indicating a significant advantage compared with CSD or DTI (P < 0.001), respectively. No significant differences were found between CSD-FT and DTI-FT offsets (P = 0.105), albeit for the compound SLF exclusively (P < 0.001).; CONCLUSIONS: Comparing HRFT techniques QBI and CSD with DTI, QBI delivered significantly better results with lowest offsets and good correlation to IOM results. Besides, QBI-FT was feasible for neurosurgical preoperative and intraoperative applications. Our findings suggest that a combined approach of QBI-FT and IOM under awake craniotomy is considerable for best preservation of neurological function in the presented setting. Overall, the implementation of selected HRFT models into neuronavigation systems seems to be a promising tool in glioma surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The accuracy of intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) is crucial for its use in neurosurgical planning and its implementation in image-guided surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest prospective correlative study of the intraoperative DTI tractography of the CST and intraoperative direct electrical subcortical stimulation (DESS) of the CST, with application of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMR).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate intraoperatively acquired DTI-based tractography of the CST in correlation with DESS.; METHODS: Twenty patients with gliomas (grades II-IV) adjacent to the CST were included in this prospective study. Bilateral DTI tractography of the CST was performed pre- and intraoperatively with application of 1.5-T iMRI and the results correlated and compared with the prevailing gold standard of DESS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were considered to quantify the correlation of DTI tractography with DESS. The intensity of DESS was correlated with the distance from the CST. Moreover, the tissue quality of stimulation points at the wall of the resection cavity was evaluated with 5-aminolevulinic acid. The clinical and volumetric outcomes at postoperative and follow-up periods were also analyzed.; RESULTS: The mean +- SD age of the patients was 54.9 +- 12 years. A total of 40 CSTs were reconstructed and 36 stimulations were included at 20 pathological CSTs, resulting in 18 true-positive, 5 false-positive, and 13 true-negative responses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of DTI tractography to localize the CST were 100%, 72%, 78%, and 100%, respectively. DTI-based tractography correlated well at 86% of DESSs, and a linear correlation was detected between the intensity of DESS and the distance. All of the patients improved clinically, and the mean extent of resection was 97.2%. 5-Aminolevulinic acid was valuable in visualizing tumor infiltration in the false-positive cases, suggesting an infiltration of the CST at stimulation points.; CONCLUSION: CST visualization in the iMRI setting appears to have a high sensitivity in accurately localizing the area of the CST adjacent to the resection cavity in glioma surgery. More prospective studies with a large sample size are needed to further support the results.

N2  -  The fiber-tracking method enables in vivo visualization of the white matter tracts of the brain using a diffusion tensor MR imaging technique. While this method represents a promising tool in the field of neurosurgery, especially when confronted with brain tumors in eloquent areas, its reliability remains unknown. We present here our preliminary validation of tractography in human subjects harboring brain tumors by comparing the results produced by neuronavigation and electrical white matter stimulation in two patients with gliomas in the eloquent area. Although we were able to visualize the pyramidal tract with the fiber-tracking technique, the images failed to present the actual size of the fiber bundles. Here we discuss the advantages and limitations of fiber-tracking in the field of neurosurgery. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter tract-specific imaging will probably become a major component of clinical neuroradiology. Fiber tracking with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used, but variability is substantial. This article reports the ranges of MR imaging appearance and right-left asymmetry of healthy corticospinal tracts (CST) reconstructed with DTI.
METHODS: For 20 healthy volunteers, whole-brain DTI data were coregistered with maps of absolute T1 and T2 relaxation times and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), all acquired at 3T. For each individual, the 2 reconstructed CSTs and their asymmetry were analyzed with respect to the number of fibers reconstructed; tract volume; and individual MR imaging parameters restricted to the tracts. Interscan variability was estimated by repeat imaging of 8 individuals.; RESULTS: Reconstructed fiber number and tract volume are highly variable, rendering them insensitive to abnormalities in disease. Individual tract-restricted MR imaging parameters are more constrained, and their population averages and normal ranges are reported. The average population asymmetry is generally zero; therefore, normal ranges for an index of asymmetry are reported. By way of example, CST-restricted MR imaging parameters and their asymmetries are shown to be abnormal in an individual with multiple sclerosis who had a lesion affecting the CST.; CONCLUSIONS: The results constitute a normative dataset for the following imaging parameters of the CST: T1, T2, MTR, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, transverse diffusivity, and the 3 diffusion tensor eigenvalues. These data can be used to identify, characterize, and establish the significance of changes in diseases that affect the CST.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Preoperative fiber tracking (FT) enables visualization of white matter pathways. However, the intraoperative accuracy of preoperative image registration is reduced due to brain shift. Intraoperative FT is currently considered the standard of anatomical accuracy, while intraoperative imaging can also be used to correct and update preoperative data by intraoperative MRI (ioMRI)-based elastic fusion (IBEF). However, the use of intraoperative tractography is restricted due to the need for additional acquisition of diffusion imaging in addition to scanner limitations, quality factors, and setup time. Since IBEF enables compensation for brain shift and updating of preoperative FT, the aim of this study was to compare intraoperative FT with IBEF of preoperative FT.
METHODS Preoperative MRI (pMRI) and ioMRI, both including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, were acquired between February and November 2018. Anatomy-based DTI FT of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the arcuate fascicle (AF) was reconstructed at various fractional anisotropy (FA) values on pMRI and ioMRI, respectively. The intraoperative DTI FT, as a baseline tractography, was fused with original preoperative FT and IBEF-compensated FT, processes referred to as rigid fusion (RF) and elastic fusion (EF), respectively. The spatial overlap index (Dice coefficient  DICE) and distances of surface points (average surface distance ASD) of fused FT before and after IBEF were analyzed and compared in operated and nonoperated hemispheres.; RESULTS Seventeen patients with supratentorial brain tumors were analyzed. On the operated hemisphere, the overlap index of pre- and intraoperative FT of the CST by DICE significantly increased by 0.09 maximally after IBEF. A significant decrease by 0.5 mm maximally in the fused FT presented by ASD was observed. Similar improvements were found in IBEF-compensated FT, for which AF tractography on the tumor hemispheres increased by 0.03 maximally in DICE and decreased by 1.0 mm in ASD.; CONCLUSIONS Preoperative tractography after IBEF is comparable to intraoperative tractography and can be a reliable alternative to intraoperative FT.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pain information from the face enters the pons via the trigeminal nerve before creating an anatomical "elbow" that turns caudally into the spinal trigeminal tract (SpTV). Visualization of the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve as it begins its descent from the nerve root entry zone (NREZ) in the pons would improve the accuracy of current procedures aimed at altering or lesioning the trigeminal nerve within the brainstem. The focus of this study was to develop a standardized protocol using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and deterministic tractography methods to image the SpTV. There are currently no standard techniques used to visualize the trigeminal nerve using DTI.
METHODS: DTI and tractography were performed on 20 patients: 17 with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), 1 with hemifacial spasm, 1 with a facial nerve tumor, and 1 with an arteriovenous malformation. A standardized protocol was developed using regions of interest (ROIs) located at the SpTV, as determined by a brainstem atlas, and the NREZ.; RESULTS: Using our standardized protocol, the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve was successfully visualized in all 20 patients. Trigeminal fibers entered the pons at the NREZ and descended through the SpTV. The accuracy of the visualized tract was confirmed through coregistration with a stereotactic atlas and anatomical scan.; CONCLUSION: A successful, robust DTI imaging and postprocessing protocol of the SpTV contributes to our understanding of its anatomical distribution within the brainstem and is a potentially new neurosurgical planning tool.

N2  -  Background Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculomas often mimic tumors on conventional imaging, differentiation of which may not be possible without invasive tissue sampling. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), owing to its unrivalled property of characterizing molecular diffusion, may help in better lesion characterization and tractography may help understand the pattern of white matter involvement by tuberculomas. Purpose To estimate qualitative and quantitative diffusion tensor changes in brain tuberculomas and to evaluate patterns of white matter involvement using 3D tractography. Material and Methods Thirty patients with brain tuberculomas were evaluated on a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner. Diffusion tensor images were acquired along 20 non-colinear encoding directions with two b-values (b = 0, b = 1000). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on quantitative fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in the center of the tuberculoma and perilesional area. Similar ROIs were placed in contralateral hemispheres for comparison. Tractography maps were also generated. Results Mean FA in the center and perilesional area of tuberculomas were 0.098 +/- 0.041 and 0.311 +/- 0.135, respectively. ADC values in corresponding regions were 0.920 +/- 0.272 x10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.157 +/- 0.277 x10(-3) mm(2)/s. These values were significantly different compared to contralateral similar brain parenchyma. Tractography revealed interruption of white fibers in the center with deviation of fibers at the periphery in the majority of tuberculomas with none showing infiltration of white matter described in tumors. Conclusion Significant qualitative as well as quantitative DTI changes were seen in tuberculoma and perilesional areas compared to contralateral hemisphere with tractography showing a pattern different from that described in tumors. These findings may help to differentiate tuberculomas from infiltrating tumors.

N2  -  Purpose: To report successful differentiation between multiple brain abscesses and brain metastases based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: Two patients with multiple brain abscesses and three patients with cystic or necrotic brain metastases were examined by echo-planar diffusion-weighted MRI in addition to conventional MRI sequences.; Results: The abscess cavities of all 28 lesions in both patients showed marked hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted MRI. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps demonstrated decreased ADC within the cavities. A total of nine cystic or necrotic metastases showed hypointensity or isointensity on diffusion-weighted MRI.; Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MRI facilitates the differentiation of multiple brain abscesses from multiple cystic or necrotic br ain metastases that show similar ring-like enhancement on routine MRI.

N2  -  Object: There is an increasing interest in preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) to preserve function during surgeries in motor eloquent brain regions. However, DTI tractography is challenged by inherent presumptions during particular tracking steps [e.g., deterministic vs. probabilistic DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) and fiber length (FL) thresholding] and the missing "ground truth" information. In the present study, we intended to establish an objective, neurophysiology-driven approach for parameter selection during DTI-FT of the corticospinal tract integrating both imaging and neurophysiological information. Methods: In ten patients with lesions in eloquent motor areas, preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) was performed, followed by individual deterministic DTI-FT from a grid of cortical seed points. We investigated over 300 combinations of FA and FL thresholds and applied subsequently a multidimensional mathematical modeling of this empirical data. Optimal DTI parameters were determined by the relationship between DTI-FT (i.e., number of fibers, NoF) and nTMS (i.e., amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials) results. Finally, neurophysiological DTI parameters and the resulting tractography were compared to the current standard approaches of deterministic DTI fiber tracking with a 75% and 50% FA and a FL threshold of 110 mm as well as with intraoperative direct cortical and subcortical stimulation. Results: There was a good goodness-of-fit for the mathematical model (r(2) = 0.68 +/- 0 13; range: 0.59-0.97; n = 8) except of two cases. Neurophysiology-driven parameter selection showed a high correlation between DTI-FT and nTMS results (r = 0.73 +/- 0.16; range: 0.38-0.93). In comparison to the standard approach, the mathematically calculated thresholds resulted in a higher NoF in 75% of patients. In 50% of patients this approach helped to clarify the exact tract location or to detect additional functional tracts, which were not identified by the standard approach. This was confirmed by direct cortical or subcortical stimulation. Conclusion: The present study evaluates a novel user-independent method to extract objective DTI-FT parameters that were completely based on neurophysiological data. The findings suggest that this method may improve the specificity and sensitivity of DTI-FT and thereby overcome the disadvantages of current approaches.

N2  -  Purpose: To compare compressed diffusion spectrum imaging (CS-DSI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with intracranial masses. We hypothesized that CS-DSI would provide superior visualization of the motor and language tracts.
Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 25 consecutive patients with intracranial masses who underwent DTI and CS-DSI for preoperative planning. Directionally-encoded anisotropy maps, and streamline hand corticospinal motor tracts and arcuate fasciculus language tracts were graded according to a 3-point scale. Tract counts, anisotropy, and lengths were also calculated. Comparisons were made using exact marginal homogeneity, McNemar's and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.; Results: Readers preferred the CS-DSI over DTI anisotropy maps in 92% of the cases, and the CS-DSI over DTI tracts in 84%. The motor tracts were graded as excellent in 80% of cases for CS-DSI versus 52% for DTI; 58% of the motor tracts graded as acceptable in DTI were graded as excellent in CS-DSI (p = 0.02). The language tracts were graded as excellent in 68% for CS-DSI versus none for DTI; 78% of the language tracts graded as acceptable by DTI were graded as excellent by CS-DSI (p < 0.001). CS-DSI demonstrated smaller normalized mean differences than DTI for motor tract counts, anisotropy and language tract counts (p_<0.01).; Conclusion: CS-DSI was preferred over DTI for the evaluation of motor and language white matter tracts in patients with intracranial masses. Results suggest that CS-DSI may be more useful than DTI for preoperative planning purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  DTI is a technique that identifies white matter tracts (WMT) non-invasively in healthy and non-healthy patients using diffusion measurements. Similar to visual pathways (VP), WMT are not visible with classical MRI or intra-operatively with microscope. DIT will help neurosurgeons to prevent destruction of the VP while removing lesions adjacent to this WMT. We have performed DTI on fifty patients before and after surgery between March 2012 to January 2014. To navigate we used a 3DT1-weighted sequence. Additionally, we performed a T2-weighted and DTIsequences. The parameters used were, FOV: 200 x 200 mm, slice thickness: 2 mm, and acquisition matrix: 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm. Axial MRI was carried out using a 32 gradient direction and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2 and b-value of 800 s/ mm. The scanning time was less than 9 min. The DTI-data obtained were processed using a FDA approved surgical navigation system program which uses a straightforward fiber-tracking approach known as fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT). This is based on the propagation of lines between regions of interest (ROI) which is defined by a physician. A maximum angle of 50, FA start value of 0.10 and ADC stop value of 0.20 mm(2)s were the parameters used for tractography. There are some limitations to this technique. The limited acquisition time frame enforces trade-offs in the image quality. Another important point not to be neglected is the brain shift during surgery. As for the latter intra-operative MRI might be helpful. Furthermore the risk of false positive or false negative tracts needs to be taken into account which might compromise the final results.

N2  -  This study is an attempt to find a way for functional imaging information to be applied clinically in radiation therapy. The basal nucleus is a collective term for a group of neural nucleus in the central nervous system that connects the pontine, brainstem, and cerebral cortex, including the caudate nucleus, the bean-shaped nucleus, the screen-shaped nucleus, and the amygdala. It is difficult to find the exact position of these neural nuclei on the computed tomography (CT) image or the T1 or T2 sequence of magnetic resonance. However, the development of neurosurgery has partially confirmed that these functional nuclei are involved in advanced cognitive functions such as memory, emotion, and learning. Neurosurgery has tried to avoid damaging these nucleus groups during surgery to improve the quality of life of patients, and there is currently no clear strategy for this in radiotherapy. Because CT and magnetic resonance spin echo (SE) sequences are difficult to find the anatomical location of the nucleus, it is difficult to have any strategy to protect these functions in radiotherapy planning. This article uses diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images and fiber bundle tracking to obtain a more accurate anatomical position of the nerve nucleus on the image, and provides some available strategies for radiotherapy to protect patients' brain function. The conclusion of this paper is that the combined application of DTI and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can better observe the relationship among tumours, functional areas and white matter fibers, and guide the designation of radiotherapy plans.

N2  -  Objectives: Awake surgery and intraoperative monitoring represent the gold standard for surgery of brain tumors located in the perisylvian region of the dominant hemisphere due to their ability to map and preserve the language network during surgery. Nevertheless, in some cases awake surgery is not feasible. This could increase the risk of postoperative language deficit. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based DTI fiber tracking (DTI-FT) provide a preoperative mapping and reconstruction of the cortico-subcortical language network. This can be used to plan and guide the surgical strategy to preserve the language function. The objective if this study is to describe the impact of a non-invasive preoperative protocol for mapping the language network through the nTMS and nTMS-based DTI-FT in patients not eligible for awake surgery and thereby operated under general anesthesia for suspected language-eloquent brain tumors.
Patients and methods: We reviewed clinical data of patients not eligible for awake surgery and operated under general anaesthesia between 2015 and 2016. All patients underwent nTMS language cortical mapping and nTMS-based DTI-FT of subcortical language fascicles. The nTMS findings were used to plan and guide the maximal safe resection of the tumor. The impact on postoperative language outcome and the accuracy of the nTMS-based mapping in predicting language deficits were evaluated.; Results: Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. The nTMS-based reconstruction of the language network was successful in all patients. Interestingly, we observed a significant association between tumor localization and the cortical distribution of the nTMS errors (p = 0.004), thereby suggesting an intra-hemispheric plasticity of language cortical areas, probably induced by the tumor itself. The nTMS mapping disclosed the true-eloquence of lesions in 12 (60%) of all suspected cases. In the remaining 8 cases (40%) the suspected eloquence of the lesion was disproved. The nTMS-based findings guided the planning and surgery through the visual feedback of navigation. This resulted in a slight reduction of the postoperative language performance at discharge that was completely recovered after one month from surgery. The accuracy of the nTMS-based protocol in predicting postoperative permanent deficits was significantly high, especially for false-eloquent lesions (p = 0.04; sensitivity 100%, specificity 57.14%, negative predictive value 100%, positive predicitive value 50%).; Conclusions: The nTMS-based preoperative mapping allows for a reliable visualization of the language network, being also able to identify an intra-hemispheric tumor-induced cortical plasticity. It allows for a customized surgical strategy that could preserve post-operative language function. This approach should be considered as a support for neurosurgeons whenever approaching patients affected by suspected language-eloquent tumors but not eligible for awake surgery.

N2  -  In the treatment of brain tumors, surgical intervention remains a common and effective therapeutic option. Recent advances in neuroimaging have provided neurosurgeons with new tools to overcome the challenge of differentiating healthy tissue from tumor-infiltrated tissue, with the aim of increasing the likelihood of maximizing the extent of resection volume while minimizing injury to functionally important regions. Novel applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and DTI-derived tractography (DDT) have demonstrated that preoperative, non-invasive mapping of eloquent cortical regions and functionally relevant white matter tracts (WMT) is critical during surgical planning to reduce postoperative deficits, which can decrease quality of life and overall survival. In this review, we summarize the latest developments of applying DTI and tractography in the context of resective surgery and highlight its utility within each stage of the neurosurgical workflow: preoperative planning and intraoperative management to improve postoperative outcomes.

N2  -  AIM: To analyse the characterization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cervical myelopathy.
METHODS: A total of 21 healthy controls and 84 patients with cervical myelopathy underwent T2-weighted imaging and DTI. The patients were divided into four groups based on the degree of cord compression and MRI signal intensity of the compressed cord as seen on T2-weighted images. The values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and eigenvalues (lambda(i)) were analysed, and fibre tracking (FT) was performed.; RESULTS: For healthy controls, the mean values from the DTI of the cervical spinal cord were ADC = 0.784 +- 0.083 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, FA = 0.721 +- 0.027, lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3) = 1.509 +- 0.145 x 10(-3), 0.416 +- 0.094 x 10(-3), and 0.411 +- 0.102 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, respectively. Only values for lambda(2) and lambda(3) differed significantly between the control and A groups (p < 0.05). The mean values of 22 and lambda(3) of group A were 0.516 +- 0.105 x 10(-3) and 0.525 +- 0.129 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, respectively. ADC, FA, lambda(1), lambda(2) and lambda(3) differed significantly between the control and B, C, D groups (p < 0.01). The FT map for group A showed a normal spinal cord, but that for groups B, C, and D showed a distorted spinal cord at the sites of compression.; CONCLUSION: The values of ADC, FA, and lambda(i) obtained with DTI could assess subtle structural damage and changes of anisotropy in the cord of cervical myelopathy. Fibre tracking was useful in verifying changes in the compressed cord. (c) 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: To develop a deep learning-based reconstruction framework for ultrafast and robust diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography.
Methods: SuperDTI was developed to learn the nonlinear relationship between DWIs and the corresponding diffusion tensor parameter maps. It bypasses the tensor fitting procedure, which is highly susceptible to noises and motions in DWIs. The network was trained and tested using data sets from the Human Connectome Project and patients with ischemic stroke. Results from SuperDTI were compared against widely used methods for tensor parameter estimation and fiber tracking.; Results: Using training and testing data acquired using the same protocol and scanner, SuperDTI was shown to generate fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps, as well as fiber tractography, from as few as six raw DWIs, with a quantification error of less than 5% in all white-matter and gray-matter regions of interest. It was robust to noises and motions in the testing data. Furthermore, the network trained using healthy volunteer data showed no apparent reduction in lesion detectability when directly applied to stroke patient data.; Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of superfast DTI and fiber tractography using deep learning with as few as six DWIs directly, bypassing tensor fitting. Such a significant reduction in scan time may allow the inclusion of DTI into the clinical routine for many potential applications.

N2  -  Functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging and diffusion MR tractography have emerged as valuable tools in the evaluation of verbal language in brain tumor patients, and have changed the way neurosurgeons look at patients with a mass in the dominant hemisphere. The techniques have obtained recognition as valuable presurgical clinical tools in the determination of hemispheric dominance and in the selection of candidates who may benefit from awake craniotomy. In the near future fMRI and diffusion MR Tractography may contribute to elucidate mechanisms of brain plasticity and may provide predictors of favorable postoperative clinical outcome. The functional anatomy of the language network and the role of fMR imaging and diffusion MR tractography in the evaluation of patients with a brain tumor are the focus of this article.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a valuable tool for assessing presumptive white matter alterations in human disease and animal models. The current study used DTI to examine the effects of selective neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus on major white matter tracts and anatomically related brain regions in macaque monkeys. Two years postlesion, structural MRI, and DTI sequences were acquired for each subject. Volumetric assessment revealed a substantial reduction in the size of the hippocampus in experimental subjects, averaging 72% relative to controls, without apparent damage to adjacent regions. DTI images were processed to yield measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), parallel diffusivity (IADC), and perpendicular diffusivity (tADC), as well as directional color maps. To evaluate potential changes in major projection systems, a region of interest (ROI) analysis was conducted including the corpus callosum, fornix, temporal stem, cingulum bundle, ventromedial prefrontal white matter, and optic radiations. Lesion-related abnormalities in the integrity of the fiber tracts examined were limited to known hippocampal circuitry, including the fornix and ventromedial prefrontal white matter. These findings are consistent with the notion that hippocampal damage results in altered interactions with multiple memory-related brain regions, including portions of the prefrontal cortex.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to present a tractography algorithm using a two-tensor unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to improve the modeling of the corticospinal tract (CST) by tracking through regions of peritumoral edema and crossing fibers.
Ten patients with brain tumors in the vicinity of motor cortex and evidence of significant peritumoral edema were retrospectively selected for the study. All patients underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including functional MRI (fMRI) and a diffusion-weighted data set with 31 directions. Fiber tracking was performed using both single-tensor streamline and two-tensor UKF tractography methods. A two-region-of-interest approach was used to delineate the CST. Results from the two tractography methods were compared visually and quantitatively. fMRI was applied to identify the functional fiber tracts.; Single-tensor streamline tractography underestimated the extent of tracts running through the edematous areas and could only track the medial projections of the CST. In contrast, two-tensor UKF tractography tracked fanning projections of the CST despite peritumoral edema and crossing fibers. Based on visual inspection, the two-tensor UKF tractography delineated tracts that were closer to motor fMRI activations, and it was apparently more sensitive than single-tensor streamline tractography to define the tracts directed to the motor sites. The volume of the CST was significantly larger on two-tensor UKF than on single-tensor streamline tractography ().; Two-tensor UKF tractography tracks a larger volume CST than single-tensor streamline tractography in the setting of peritumoral edema and crossing fibers in brain tumor patients.

N2  -  DTI is a technique that identifies white matter tracts (WMT) non-invasively in healthy and non-healthy patients using diffusion measurements. Similar to visual pathways (VP), WMT are not visible with classical MRI or intra-operatively with microscope. DTI will help neurosurgeons to prevent destruction of the VP while removing lesions adjacent to this WMT. We have performed DTI on fifty patients before and after surgery between March 2012 to January 2014. To navigate we used a 3DT1-weighted sequence. Additionally, we performed a T2-weighted and DTI-sequences. The parameters used were, FOV: 200 x 200 mm, slice thickness: 2 mm, and acquisition matrix: 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm. Axial MRI was carried out using a 32 gradient direction and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2 and b-value of 800 s/mm(2). The scanning time was less than 9 min.
The DTI-data obtained were processed using a FDA approved surgical navigation system program which uses a straightforward fiber-tracking approach known as fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT). This is based on the propagation of lines between regions of interest (ROI) which is defined by a physician. A maximum angle of 50, FA start value of 0.10 and ADC stop value of 0.20 mm(2)s were the parameters used for tractography.; There are some limitations to this technique. The limited acquisition time frame enforces trade-offs in the image quality. Another important point not to be neglected is the brain shift during surgery. As for the latter intra-operative MRI might be helpful. Furthermore the risk of false positive or false negative tracts needs to be taken into account which might compromise the final results.

N2  -  Observations of extreme unilateral widening of Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS) are rare and hitherto confined to adult, mainly old-aged patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in two unrelated boys aged 3 years with developmental coordination disorders. In one of these patients, follow-up MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were carried out 5 years later. In both boys, MRI incidentally revealed numerous intracerebral cysts strictly confined to one hemisphere. Localization, size, shape, and signal isointensity to cerebrospinal fluid indicated unilateral marked widening of VRS. In one patient, follow-up investigation after 5 years showed unchanged dilation of VRS on MRI, but mild facial hemihypertrophy, ipsilateral to the widened VRS. DTI indicated displacement rather than disruption of fiber tracks adjacent to the dilated VRS. Unilateral widening of VRS may be detected fortuitously on neuroimaging already in early childhood.

N2  -  White matter connections enable the interaction within and between brain networks. Brain lesions can cause structural disconnections that disrupt networks and thereby cognitive functions supported by them. In recent years, novel methods have been developed to quantify the extent of structural disconnection after focal lesions, using tractography data from healthy controls. These methods, however, are indirect and their reliability and validity have yet to be fully established. In this study, we present our implementation of this approach, in a tool supplemented by uncertainty metrics for the predictions overall and at voxel-level. These metrics give an indication of the reliability and are used to compare predictions with direct measures from patients' diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in a sample of 95 first-ever stroke patients. Results show that, except for small lesions, the tool can predict fiber loss with high reliability and compares well to direct patient DTI estimates. Clinical utility of the method was demonstrated using lesion data from a subset of patients suffering from hemianopia. Both tract-based measures outperformed lesion localization in mapping visual field defects and showed a network consistent with the known anatomy of the visual system. This study offers an important contribution to the validation of structural disconnection mapping. We show that indirect measures of structural disconnection can be a reliable and valid substitute for direct estimations of fiber loss after focal lesions. Moreover, based on these results, we argue that indirect structural disconnection measures may even be preferable to lower-quality single subject diffusion MRI when based on high-quality healthy control datasets.

N2  -  Objective: Tumors in eloquent areas of the brain like Broca or Wernicke might have disastrous consequences for patients. We intended to visualize the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and to demonstrate his relation with the corticospinal tract and the visual pathway using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Methods: We depicted between 2012 and 2014 the AF in 71 patients. Men and women of all ages were included. Eleven patients had postoperative controls also. We used a 3DT1-sequence for the navigation. Furthermore T2- and DTI-sequences were performed. The FOV was 200 x 200 mm(2), slice thickness 2 mm, and an acquisition matrix of 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm. 3-Tesla-MRI was carried out strictly axial using 32 gradient directions and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2. b-Value was 800 simm(2). Additional scanning time was less than 9 min.; Results: AF was portrayed in 63 patients bilaterally. In one glioblastoma patient it was impossible to visualize the left AF and in seven other patients we could not portray the right one. The lesions affected AF by disrupting or displacing the fibers.; Conclusions: DTI might be a useful tool to portray AF. It is time-saving and can be used to preserve morbidity in patients with lesions in eloquent brain areas. It might give deeper insights of the white matter and the reorganization of AF-fibers postoperatively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The free-water correction algorithm (Freewater Estimator Using Interpolated Initialization [FERNET]) can be applied to standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to improve visualization of subcortical bundles in the peritumoral area of highly edematous brain tumors. Interest in its use for presurgical planning in purely infiltrative gliomas without peritumoral edema has never been evaluated. Using subcortical maps obtained with direct electrostimulation (DES) in awake surgery as a reference standard, the authors sought to 1) assess the accuracy of preoperative DTI- based tractography with FERNET in a series of nonedematous glioma patients, and 2) determine its potential usefulness in presurgical planning. METHODS Based on DES-induced functional disturbances and tumor topography, the authors retrospectively reconstructed the putatively stimulated bundles and the peritumoral tracts of interest (various associative and projection pathways) of 12 patients. The tractography data obtained with and without FERNET were compared. RESULTS The authors identified 21 putative tracts from 24 stimulation sites and reconstituted 49 tracts of interest. The number of streamlines of the putative tracts crossing the DES area was 26.8% higher (96.04 vs 75.75, p = 0.016) and their volume 20.4% higher (13.99 cm3 3 vs 11.62 cm(3), p < 0.0001) with FERNET than with standard DTI. Additionally, the volume of the tracts of interest was 22.1% higher (9.69 cm3 3 vs 7.93 cm3, 3 , p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Free-water correction significantly increased the anatomical plausibility of the stimulated fascicles and the volume of tracts of interest in the peritumoral area of purely infiltrative nonedematous gliomas. Because of the functional importance of the peritumoral zone, applying FERNET to DTI could have potential implications on surgical planning and the safety of glioma resection.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) in combination with diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) is increasingly used to locate subcortical language-related pathways. The aim of this study was to establish nTMS-based DTI FT for preoperative risk stratification by evaluating associations between lesion-to-tract distances (LTDs) and aphasia and by determining a cut-off LTD value to prevent surgery-related permanent aphasia.
METHODS Fifty patients with left-hemispheric, language-eloquent brain tumors underwent preoperative nTMS language mapping and nTMS-based DTI FT, followed by tumor resection. nTMS-based DTI FT was performed with a pre-defined fractional anisotropy (FA) of 0.10, 0.15, 50% of the individual FA threshold (FAT), and 75% FAT (minimum fiber length FL: 100 mm). The arcuate fascicle (AF), superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), inferior longitudinal fascicle (ILF), uncinate fascicle (UC), and frontooccipital fascicle (FoF) were identified in nTMS-based tractography, and minimum LTDs were measured between the lesion and the AF and between the lesion and the closest other subcortical language-related pathway (SLF, ILF, UC, or FoF). LTDs were then associated with the level of aphasia (notransient or permanent surgery-related aphasia, according to follow-up examinations).; RESULTS A significant difference in LTDs was observed between patients with no or only surgery-related transient impairment and those who developed surgery-related permanent aphasia with regard to the AF (FA = 0.10, p = 0.0321; FA = 0.15, p = 0.0143; FA = 50% FAT, p = 0.0106) as well as the closest other subcortical language-related pathway (FA = 0.10, p = 0.0182; FA = 0.15, p = 0.0200; FA = 50% FAT, p = 0.0077). Patients with surgery-related permanent aphasia showed the lowest LTDs in relation to these tracts. Thus, LTDs of >= 8 mm (AF) and >= 11 mm (SLF, ILF, UC, or FoF) were determined as cut-off values for surgery-related permanent aphasia.; CONCLUSIONS nTMS-based DTI FT of subcortical language-related pathways seems suitable for risk stratification and prediction in patients suffering from language-eloquent brain tumors. Thus, the current role of nTMS-based DTI FT might be expanded, going beyond the level of being a mere tool for surgical planning and resection guidance.

N2  -  Classifying low-grade glioma (LGG) patients from high-grade glioma (HGG) is one of the most challenging tasks in planning treatment strategies for brain tumor patients. Previous studies derived several handcrafted features based on the tumor's texture and volume from magnetic resonance images (MRI) to classify LGG and HGG patients. The accuracy of classification was moderate. We aimed to classify LGG from HGG with high accuracy using the brain white matter (WM) network connectivity matrix constructed using diffusion tensor tractography. We obtained diffusion tensor images (DTI) of 44 LGG and 48 HGG patients using routine clinical imaging. Fiber tractography and brain parcellation were performed for each patient to obtain the fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity weighted connectivity matrices. We used a deep convolutional neural network (DNN) for classification and the gradient class activation map (GRAD-CAM) technique to identify the neural connectivity features focused on by the DNN. DNN could classify both LGG and HGG with 98% accuracy. The sensitivity and specificity values were above 0.98. GRAD-CAM analysis revealed a distinct WM network pattern between LGG and HGG patients in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Our results demonstrate that glioma affects the WM network in LGG and HGG patients differently.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been proven to alleviate tremor of various origins. Distinct regions have been targeted. One explanation for good clinical tremor control might be the involvement of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRT) as has been suggested in superficial (thalamic) and inferior (posterior subthalamic) target regions. Beyond a correlation with atlas data and the postmortem evaluation of patients treated with lesion surgery, proof for the involvement of DRT in tremor reduction in the living, the scope of this work, is elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of unilateral refractory tremor in tremor-dominant Parkinson disease treated with thalamic DBS.; METHODS: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed. Correlation with individual DBS electrode contact locations was obtained through postoperative fusion of helical computed tomography (CT) data with DTI fiber tracking.; RESULTS: Tremor was alleviated effectively. An evaluation of the active electrode contact position revealed clear involvement of the DRT in tremor control. A closer evaluation of clinical effects and side effects revealed a highly detailed individual fiber map of the subthalamic region with DTI fiber tracking.; CONCLUSION: This is the first time the involvement of the DRT in tremor reduction through DBS has been shown in the living. The combination of DTI with postoperative CT and the evaluation of the electrophysiological environment of distinct electrode contacts led to an individual detailed fiber map and might be extrapolated to refined DTI-based targeting strategies in the future. Data acquisition for a larger study group is the topic of our ongoing research.

N2  -  Introduction Despite evidence of correspondence with intraoperative stimulation, there remains limited data on MRI diffusion tractography (DT)'s sensitivity to predict morbidity after neurosurgical oncology treatment. Our aims were: (1) evaluate DT against subcortical stimulation mapping and performance changes during and after awake neurosurgery; (2) evaluate utility of early post-operative DT to predict recovery from post-surgical deficits. Methods We retrospectively reviewed our first 100 awake neurosurgery procedures using DT- neuronavigation. Intra-operative stimulation and performance outcomes were assessed to classify DT predictions for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Post-operative DT data, available in 51 patients, were inspected for tract damage. Results 91 adult brain tumor patients (mean 49.2 years, 43 women) underwent 100 awake surgeries with subcortical stimulation between 2014 and 2019. Sensitivity and specificity of pre-operative DT predictions were 92.2% and 69.2%, varying among tracts. Post-operative deficits occurred after 41 procedures (39%), but were prolonged (> 3 months) in only 4 patients (4%). Post-operative DT in general confirmed surgical preservation of tracts. Post-operative DT anticipated complete recovery in a patient with supplementary motor area syndrome, and indicated infarct-related damage to corticospinal fibers associated with delayed, partial recovery in a second patient. Conclusions Pre-operative DT provided very accurate predictions of the spatial location of tracts in relation to a tumor. As expected, however, the presence of a tract did not inform its functional status, resulting in variable DT specificity among individual tracts. While prolonged deficits were rare, DT in the immediate post-operative period offered additional potential to monitor neurological deficits and anticipate recovery potential.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In adults, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has been established as a preoperative examination method for brain tumors in motor- and language-eloquent locations. However, the clinical relevance of nTMS in children with brain tumors is still unclear. Here, the authors present their initial experience with nTMS-based surgical planning and family counseling in pediatric cases.
METHODS The authors analyzed the feasibility of nTMS and its influence on counseling and surgical strategy in a prospective study conducted between July 2017 and September 2019. The main inclusion criterion was a potential benefit from functional mapping data derived from nTMS andor nTMS-enhanced tractography in pediatric patients who presented to the authors' department prior to surgery for lesions close to motor- andor speech-eloquent areas. The study was undertaken in 14 patients (median age 7 years, 8 males) who presented with different brain lesions.; RESULTS Motor mapping combined with cortical seed area definition could be performed in 10 children (71%) to identify the corticospinal tract by additional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). All motor mappings could be performed successfully without inducing relevant side effects. In 7 children, nTMS language mapping was performed to detect language-relevant cortical areas and DTI fiber tractography was performed to visualize the individual language network. nTMS examination was not possible in 4 children because of lack of compliance (n = 2), syncope (n = 1), and preexisting implant (n = 1). After successful mapping, the spatial relation between lesion and functional tissue was used for surgical planning in all 10 patients, and 9 children underwent nTMS-DTI integrated neuronavigation. No surgical complications or unexpected neurological deterioration was observed. In all successful nTMS cases, better function-based counseling was offered to the families. In 6 of 10 patients the surgical strategy was adapted according to nTMS data, and in 6 of 10 cases the extent of resection (EOR) was redefined.; CONCLUSIONS nTMS and DTI fiber tracking were feasible for the majority of children. Presurgical counseling as well as surgical planning for the approach and EOR were improved by the nTMS examination results. nTMS in combination with DTI fiber tracking can be regarded as beneficial for neurosurgical procedures in eloquent areas in the pediatric population.

N2  -  Introduction: Visual hallucinations that arise following vision loss stem from aberrant functional activity in visual cortices and an imbalance of activity across associated cortical and subcortical networks subsequent to visual pathway damage. We sought to determine if structural changes in white matter connectivity play a role in cases of chronic visual hallucinations associated with visual cortical damage.
Methods: We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic fiber tractography to assess white matter connectivity in a patient suffering from continuous and disruptive phosphene (simple) visual hallucinations for more than 2years following right occipital stroke. We compared these data to that of healthy age-matched controls.; Results: Probabilistic tractography to reconstruct white matter tracts suggests regeneration of terminal fibers of the ipsilesional optic radiations in the patient. However, arrangement of the converse reconstruction of these tracts, which were seeded from the ipsilesional visual cortex to the intrahemispheric lateral geniculate body, remained disrupted. We further observed compromised structural characteristics, and changes in diffusion (measured using diffusion tensor indices) of white matter tracts in the patient connecting the visual cortex with frontal and temporal regions, and also in interhemispheric connectivity between visual cortices.; Conclusions: Cortical remapping and the disruption of communication between visual cortices and remote regions are consistent with our previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data showing imbalanced functional activity of the same regions in this patient (Rafique etal, 2016, Neurology, 87, 1493-1500). Long-term adaptive and disruptive changes in white matter connectivity may account for the rare nature of cases presenting with chronic and continuous visual hallucinations.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging white matter tractography, an increasingly popular preop-erative planning modality used for pre-surgical planning in brain tumor patients, is employed with the goal of maximizing tumor resection while sparing postoperative neurological function. Clinical translation of white matter tractography has been limited by several shortcomings of standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including poor modeling of fibers crossing through regions of peritumoral edema and low spatial resolution for typical clinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) sequences. Track density imaging (TDI) is a post-tractography technique that uses the number of tractography streamlines and their long-range continuity to map the white matter connections of the brain with enhanced image resolution relative to the acquired dMRI data, potentially offering improved white matter visualization in patients with brain tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of TDI-based white matter maps in a neurosurgical planning context compared to the current clinical standard of DTI-based white matter maps.Methods: Fourteen consecutive brain tumor patients from a single institution were retrospectively selected for the study. Each patient underwent 3-Tesla dMRI scanning with 30 gradient directions and a b-value of 1000 s/mm2. For each patient, two directionally encoded color (DEC) maps were produced as follows. DTI-based DEC-fractional anisotropy maps (DEC-FA) were generated on the scanner, while DEC-track density images (DEC-TDI) were generated using constrained spherical deconvolution based tractography. The potential clinical utility of each map was assessed by five practicing neurosurgeons, who rated the maps according to four clinical utility statements regarding different clinical aspects of pre-surgical planning. The neurosurgeons rated each map according to their agreement with four clinical utility statements regarding if the map 1 identified clinically relevant tracts, (2) helped establish a goal resection margin, (3) influenced a planned surgical route, and (4) was useful overall. Cumulative link mixed effect modeling and analysis of variance were performed to test the primary effect of map type (DEC-TDI vs. DEC-FA) on rater score. Pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means were then calculated to deter-mine the magnitude and directionality of differences in rater scores by map type.Results: A majority of rater responses agreed with the four clinical utility statements, indicating that neurosur-geons found both DEC maps to be useful. Across all four investigated clinical utility statements, the DEC map type significantly influenced rater score. Rater scores were significantly higher for DEC-TDI maps compared to DEC-FA maps. The largest effect size in rater scores in favor of DEC-TDI maps was observed for clinical utility statement 2, which assessed establishing a goal resection margin.Conclusion: We observed a significant neurosurgeon preference for DEC-TDI maps, indicating their potential utility for neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the utility of a proposed clinical diffusion imaging scheme for rapidly generating multiple b-value diffusion contrast in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Materials and Methods: Our strategy for efficient image acquisition relies on the invariance property of the diffusion tensor eigenvectors to b-value. A simple addition to the conventional diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) data acquisition scheme used for tractography yields diffusion-weighted images at twice and three times the conventional b-value. An example from a neurosurgical brain tumor is shown. Apparent diffusion-weighted (ADW) images were calculated for b-values 800, 1600, and 2400 smm(2), and a map of excess diffusive kurtosis was computed from the three ADWs.; Results: High b-value ADW images demonstrated decreased contrast between normal gray and white matter, while the heterogeneity and contrast of the lesion was emphasized relative to conventional b-value data. Kurtosis maps indicated the deviation from Gaussian diffusive behavior.; Conclusion: DTI data with multiple b-values and good SNR can be acquired in clinically reasonable times. High b-value ADW images show increased contrast and add information to conventional DWI. Ambiguity in conventional b-value images over whether hyperintense signal results from abnormally low diffusion, or abnormally long T(2), Is better resolved in high b-value images.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Brain tumors can result in displacement or destruction of important white matter tracts such as the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can assess the extent of this effect and potentially provide neurosurgeons with an accurate map to guide tumor resection; analyze IFOF displacement patterns in temporoinsular gliomas based on tumor grading and topography in the temporal lobe; and assess whether these patterns follow a predictable pattern, to assist in maximal tumor resection while preserving IFOF function. Methods Thirty-four patients with temporal gliomas and available presurgical MRI were recruited. Twenty-two had insula infiltration. DTI deterministic region of interest (ROI)-based tractography was performed using commercial software. Tumor topographic imaging characteristics analyzed were as follows: location in the temporal lobe and extent of extratemporal involvement. Qualitative tractographic data obtained from directional DTI color maps included type of involvement (displaced/edematous-infiltrated/destroyed) and displacement direction. Quantitative tractographic data of ipsi- and contralateral IFOF included whole tract volume, fractional anisotropy, and fractional anisotropy of a 2-dimensional coronal ROI on the tract at the point of maximum tumor involvement. Results The most common tract involvement pattern was edematous/infiltrative displacement. Displacement patterns depended on main tumor location in the temporal lobe and presence of insular involvement. All tumors showed superior displacement pattern. In lateral tumors, displacement tendency was medial. In medial tumors, displacement tendency was lateral. When we add insular involvement, the tendency was more medial displacement. A qualitative and quantitative assessment supported these results. Conclusions IFOF displacement patterns are reproducible and suitable for temporoinsular gliomas presurgical planning.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine whether radiation-induced changes in white matter tracts are uniform across the brainstem.
Methods and Materials: We analyzed serial diffusion tensor imaging data, acquired before radiation therapy and over 48 to 72 months of follow-up, from 42 pediatric patients (age 6-20 years) with medulloblastoma. FSL software (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) was used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial, radial, and mean diffusivities. For a consistent identification of volumes of interest (VOIs), the parametric maps of each patient were transformed to a standard brain space (MNI152), on which we identified VOIs including corticospinal tract (CST), medial lemniscus (ML), transverse pontine fiber (TPF), and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) at the level of pons. Temporal changes of DTI parameters in VOIs were compared using a linear mixed effect model.; Results: Radiation-induced white matter injury was marked by a decline in FA after treatment. The decline was often accompanied by decreased axial diffusivity, increased radial diffusivity, or both. This implied axonal damage and demyelination. We observed that the magnitude of the changes was not always uniform across substructures of the brainstem. Specifically, the changes in DTI parameters for TPF were more pronounced than in other regions (P<.001 for FA) despite similarities in the distribution of dose. We did not find a significant difference among CST, ML, and MCP in these patients (P>.093 for all parameters).; Conclusions: Changes in the structural integrity of white matter tracts, assessed by DTI, were not uniform across the brainstem after radiation therapy. These results support a role for tract-based assessment in radiation treatment planning and determination of brainstem tolerance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Objective: To analyze the efficacy and safety of cortical and subcortical electrical stimulation CSES and awake surgery to approach purely subcortical tumors in highly functional locations, particularly in guiding the choice of the best transcortical path.
Patients and methods: Prospective analysis of the surgical, neurological, and radiological outcome of patients harboring supratentorial, subcortically located brain tumors or vascular malformations who are operated on through awake surgery and CSES. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI; either sensorymotor or language, based on the location) was performed in order to confirm the proximity to functional cortical areas. Major white matter tracts were investigated by MRI diffusion tensor fiber tracking (DTI-ft). The Rankin modified score was chosen to express the pre and postoperative functional neurological status. Immediate postoperative MRI was used to evaluate the extent of resection.; Results: Seventeen patients were selected. The main distance of the tumors from the cortical surface was 18.2 mm (range 9-48 mm). Neuronavigation was used to show the most direct route to the tumor (transsulcal or transgyral), but CSES was fundamental to adapt the surgical corridor to the functional topography both cortically and subcortically. If the transgyral route was chosen, CSES helped to detect a non-eloquent area. When a transsulcal route was preferred, CSES documented the presence or absence of function in the deep sulcus. The transient postoperative morbidity was 76.4%, but at last follow-up (range 4-20 months), all the patients regained preoperative status and 2 improved. Postoperative MRI demonstrated complete resection in all cases.; Conclusions: Approaching purely subcortical tumors requires microsurgical skills, but in eloquent areas, functional topography monitoring is mandatory to allow safe surgery. CSES in an awake patient is a method that produces very good results in terms of resection and neurological outcome. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Maintaining the integrity of crucial fiber tracts allows functional preservation and improved recovery in patients with glioma resection. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and intraoperative subcortical mapping (ISM) are commonly required for pre- and intraoperative assessment of white matter fibers. This study investigated differences of clinical outcomes in glioma resection aided by DTI or ISM. A comprehensive literature retrieval of the PubMed and Embase databases identified several DTI or ISM studies in 2000-2022. Clinical data, including extent of resection (EOR) and postoperative neurological deficits, was collected and statistically analyzed. Heterogeneity was regressed by a random effect model and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to test statistical significance. Publication bias was assessed by Egger test. A total of 14 studies with a pooled cohort of 1837 patients were included. Patients undergoing DTI-navigated glioma surgery showed a higher rate of gross total resection (GTR) than ISM-assisted surgical resection (67.88%, [95% CI 0.55-0.79] vs. 45.73%, [95% CI 0.29-0.63], P = 0.032). The occurrence of early postoperative functional deficit (35.45%, [95% CI 0.13-0.61] vs. 35.60% [95% CI 0.20-0.53], P = 1.000), late postoperative functional deficit (6.00%, [95% CI 0.02-0.11] vs. 4.91% [95% CI 0.03-0.08], P = 1.000) and severe postoperative functional deficit (2.21%, [95% CI 0-0.08] vs. 5.93% [95% CI 0.01-0.16], P = 0.393) were similar between the DTI and ISM group, respectively. While DTI-navigation resulted in a higher rate of GTR, the occurrence of postoperative neurological deficits between DTI and ISM groups was comparable. Together, these data indicate that both techniques could safely facilitate glioma resection.

N2  -  Although DTI can provide detailed information about white matter anatomy, it is not yet straightforward enough to quantify the anatomical information it visualizes. In this study, we developed and tested a new tool to perform brain normalization and voxel-based analysis of DTI data. For the normalization part, manually placed landmarks ensured that the visualized white matter tracts were well-registered among the populations. A standard landmark set in ICBM-152 space and an interface to remap them to subject data were integrated in the procedure. After landmark placement, highly elastic non-linear Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) was driven by the landmarks to normalize the brainstem anatomy of normal subjects. The approach was then applied to delineate brainstem tract abnormalities in patients with left chronic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. The voxel-based comparison between control and patient groups identified abnormalities in the ipsilesional corticospinal tract and contralesional cerebellar peduncles. We believe that this tool is useful for regional brain normalization of patients with severe anatomical alterations, such as stroke, brain tumor, and lobectomy, for whom standard automated normalization tools may not work properly.

N2  -  In this work, we propose to use fiber tracking in order to analyze and quantify the state of the pyramidal tracts in patients affected by tumors. We introduce a framework that includes an automatic method to obtain the fibers involved in the pyramidal tract of any subject, in order to compare robustly fiber bundles affected by tumors with healthy fiber tracts from control subjects and also to quantify the relative state of degeneration between the fiber tracts in the two hemispheres of the same patient. The comparative analyses proposed in our methodology are based on a new set of measures on the pyramidal tract, which take into account intrinsic properties of the fibers involved in the bundle as well as the similarity with the pyramidal tract of a standard healthy subject, modeled as the average of a set of controls. In order to perform better comparison studies and to take into account more information of the whole bundle, a mapping technique is used to represent the fiber tracts in 2D. Here, we show a set of experiments using 5 tumor patients and 10 control subjects, including pre- and post-operative studies in patients that have been treated with partial or total tumor resection. The results obtained indicate the usefulness of the method showing good overall performance. A reproducibility study using several acquisitions of the same patient is also presented to validate the techniques employed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is commonly used in neurosurgical practice but is largely limited to the preoperative setting. This is due primarily to image degradation caused by susceptibility artifact when conventional single-shot (SS) echo-planar imaging (EPI) DTI (SS-DTI) is acquired for open cranial, surgical position intraoperative DTI (iDTI). Readout-segmented (RS) EPI DTI (RS-DTI) has been reported to reduce such artifact but has not yet been evaluated in the intraoperative MRI (iMRI) environment. The authors evaluated the performance of RS versus SS EPI for DTI of the human brain in the iMRI setting.
METHODS Pre- and intraoperative 3-T 3D T1-weighted and 2D multislice RS-iDTI (called RESOLVE readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains on the Siemens platform) and SS-iDTI images were acquired in 22 adult patients undergoing intraaxial iMRI resections for suspected low-grade glioma (14; 64%), high-grade glioma (7; 32%), or focal cortical dysplasia. Regional susceptibility artifact, anatomical deviation relative to T1-weighted imaging, and tractographic output for surgically relevant tracts were compared between iDTI sequences as well as the intraoperative tract shifts from preoperative DTI.; RESULTS RS-iDTI resulted in qualitatively less regional susceptibility artifact (resection cavity, orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortices) and mean anatomical deviation in regions most prone to susceptibility artifact (RS-iDTI 2.7 +- 0.2 vs SS- iDTI 7.5 +- 0.4 mm) compared to SS-iDTI. Although tract reconstruction success did not significantly differ by DTI method, susceptibility artifact-related tractography failure (of at least 1 surgically relevant tract) occurred for SS-iDTI in 822 (36%) patients, and in 5 of these 8 patients RS- iDTI permitted successful reconstruction. Among cases with successful tractography for both sequences, maximal intersequence differences were substantial (mean 9.5 +- 5.7 mm, range -27.1 to 18.7 mm).; CONCLUSIONS RS EPI enables higher quality and more accurate DTI for surgically relevant tractography of major white matter tracts in intraoperative, open cranium neurosurgical applications at 3 T.

N2  -  Purpose: Previous efforts to decrease neurocognitive effects of radiation focused on sparing isolated cortical structures. We hypothesize that understanding temporal, spatial, and dosimetric patterns of radiation damage to whole-brain white matter (WM) after partial-brain irradiation might also be important. Therefore, we carried out a study to develop the methodology to assess radiation therapy (RT)-induced damage to whole-brain WM bundles.
Methods and Materials: An atlas-based, automated WM tractography analysis was implemented to quantify longitudinal changes in indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 major WM fibers in 33 patients with predominantly low-grade or benign brain tumors treated by RT. Six DTI scans per patient were performed from before RT to 18 months after RT. The DTI indices and planned doses (maximum and mean doses) were mapped onto profiles of each of 22 WM bundles. A multivariate linear regression was performed to determine the main dose effect as well as the influence of other clinical factors on longitudinal percentage changes in axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) from before RT.; Results: Among 22 fiber bundles, AD or RD changes in 12 bundles were affected significantly by doses (P<.05), as the effect was progressive over time. In 9 elongated tracts, decreased AD or RD was significantly related to maximum doses received, consistent with a serial structure. In individual bundles, AD changes were up to 11.5% at the maximum dose locations 18 months after RT. The dose effect on WM was greater in older female patients than younger male patients.; Conclusions: Our study demonstrates for the first time that the maximum dose to the elongated WM bundles causes post-RT damage in WM. Validation and correlative studies are necessary to determine the ability and impact of sparing these bundles on preserving neurocognitive function after RT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can induce long-term behavioral and cognitive disorders. Although the exact origin of these mTBI-related disorders is not known, they may be the consequence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Here, we investigated whether MRI at the subacute stage can detect lesions that are associated with poor functional outcome in mTBI by using anatomical images (T-1) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-three patients with mTBI were investigated and compared with 23 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an MRI investigation and clinical tests between 7 and 28 days (D15) and between 3 and 4 months (M3) after injury. Patients were divided in two groups of poor outcome (PO) and good outcome (GO), based on their complaints at M3. Groupwise differences in gray matter partial volume between PO patients, GO patients and controls were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) from T-1 data at D15. Differences in microstructural architecture were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and the diffusion images obtained from DTI data at D15. Permutation-based non-parametric testing was used to assess cluster significance at p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Twelve GO patients and 11 PO patients were identified on the basis of their complaints. In PO patients, gray matter partial volume was significantly lower in several cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls, but did not differ from that of GO patients. No difference in diffusion variables was found between GO and controls. PO patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity values than both controls and GO patients in the corpus callosum, the right anterior thalamic radiations and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. In conclusion, PO patients differed from GO patients by the presence of diffusion changes in long association white matter fiber tracts but not by gray matter partial volume. These results suggest that DTI at the subacute stage may be a predictive marker of poor outcome in mTBI. Hum Brain Mapp 32:999-1011, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  The inherent invasiveness of malignant cells is a major determinant of the poor prognosis of cerebral gliomas. Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) can identify white matter abnormalities in gliomas that are not seen on conventional imaging. By breaking down DTI into its isotropic (p) and anisotropic (q) components, we can determine tissue diffusion "signatures". In this study we have characterised these abnormalities in peritumoural white matter tracts. Thirty-five patients with cerebral gliomas and seven normal volunteers were imaged with DTI and T2-weighted sequences at 3 T. Displaced, infiltrated and disrupted white matter tracts were identified using fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and directionally encoded colour maps and characterised using tissue signatures. The diffusion tissue signatures were normal in ROIs where the white matter was displaced. Infiltrated white matter was characterised by an increase in the isotropic component of the tensor (p) and a less marked reduction of the anisotropic component (q). In disrupted white matter tracts, there was a marked reduction in q and increase in p. The direction of water diffusion was grossly abnormal in these cases. Diffusion tissue signatures may be a useful method of assessing occult white matter infiltration.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Frameless stereotactic biopsy repre-sents a minimally invasive procedure used for the histopathological diagnosis of brain tumors or to safely approach deep-seated lesions near eloquent areas not amenable for classical neurosurgical procedures. Traditionally, biopsy is performed relying on anatomical landmarks, but it can lead itself to intraand postoperative complications, such as hemorrhage and fiber disruption. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography represents a useful tool that can analyze the individual fiber tract conformation in cases of brain tumor and consequently identify the best biopsy trajectory, preserving white matter pathways. In our study, we present a novel technique that is based on the use of preoperative DTI for biopsy.
METHODS: Between January 2018 and January 2020, data about patients who underwent frameless biopsy using DTI tractography were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criterion was adult patients eligible for elective surgery for a single or multiple deep-seated lesions with contraindications to complete surgical resection.; RESULTS: We included 12 patients (mean age of 67.9 9.6 years). A single cranial lesion was detected in 7 cases, and multiple lesions in 5 cases. The use of DTI enabled the identification of white matter pathways in all cases and adjustment of the biopsy trajectory based on anatomical landmarks in 7 cases. Postoperative hematoma was reported in 1 case, and histological diagnosis was obtained in 11 cases.; CONCLUSION: According to our results, tractography is a useful tool that can enhance the safety of cerebral lesions biopsy sparing any fiber tract damages.

N2  -  Purpose: Motor function and recovery after stroke likely rely directly on the residual anatomical connections in the brain and its resting-state functional connectivity. Both structural and functional properties of cortical networks after stroke are revealed using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) can extract functional networks of the brain at rest, while structural connectivity can be estimated from white matter fiber orientations measured with high angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). A model that marries these two techniques may be the key to understanding functional recovery after stroke. In this study, a novel set of voxel-level measures of structurofunctional correlations (SFC) was developed and tested in a group of chronic stroke subjects.
Methods: A fully automated method is presented for modeling the structure-function relationship of brain connectivity in individuals with stroke. Brains from ten chronic stroke subjects and nine age-matched controls were imaged with a structural T1-weighted scan, resting-state fMRI, and HARDI. Each subject's T1-weighted image was nonlinearly registered to a T1-weighted 152-brain MNI template using a local histogram-matching technique that alleviates distortions caused by brain lesions. Fractional anisotropy maps and mean BOLD images of each subject were separately registered to the individual's T1-weighted image using affine transformations. White matter fiber orientations within each voxel were estimated with the q-ball model, which approximates the orientation distribution function (ODF) from the diffusion-weighted measurements. Deterministic q-ball tractography was performed in order to obtain a set of fiber trajectories. The new structurofunctional correlation method assigns each voxel a new BOLD time course based on a summation of its structural connections with a common fiber length interval. Then, the voxel's original time-course was correlated with this fiber-distance BOLD signal to derive a novel structurofunctional correlation coefficient. These steps were repeated for eight fiber distance intervals, and the maximum of these correlations was used to define an intrinsic structurofunctional correlation (iSFC) index. A network-based SFC map (nSFC) was also developed in order to enhance resting-state functional networks derived from conventional functional connectivity analyses. iSFC and nSFC maps were individually compared between stroke subjects and controls using a voxel-based two-tailed Student's t-test (alpha = 0.01). A linear regression was also performed between the SFC metrics and the Box and Blocks Score, a clinical measure of arm motor function.; Results: Significant decreases (p < 0.01) in iSFC were found in stroke subjects within functional hubs of the brain, including the precuneus, prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and cingulate gyrus. Many of these differences were significantly correlated with the Box and Blocks Score. The nSFC maps of prefrontal networks in control subjects revealed localized increases within the cerebellum, and these enhancements were diminished in stroke subjects. This finding was further supported by a reduction in functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Default-mode network nSFC maps were higher in the contralesional hemisphere of lower-functioning stroke subjects.; Conclusion: The results demonstrate that changes after a stroke in both intrinsic and network-based structurofunctional correlations at rest are correlated with motor function, underscoring the importance of residual structural connectivity in cortical networks.

N2  -  Aim: The aim of this work is to describe a procedure for visualization of the white matter fiber tracts with the use of DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging), the use of the reconstructed image data in neuronavigation, and to document the clinical relevance of the method. Materials and methods: This paper contains descriptions of two cases of patients with supratentorial tumorous lesion, where tractography results were used intraoperatively. A procedure that was previously described in literature, using the applications Volume One and dTV, was used for the fiber-tracking and for the import into the neuronavigation system. Resulting fiber tracts were voxelized and fused with the non-diffusion weighted dataset (b = 0 s/mm(2)), the fused images were imported into the neuronavigation and registered with the anatomical datasets. Results: In both cases, clinically relevant neural tracts were successfully reconstructed with the use of the described method, and the reconstructed images were imported into the neuronavigation system. The optimal trajectory and extent of the resection could be planned with the use of the neuronavigation, respecting the course of the displayed fiber tracts in the vicinity of the resected lesion. Conclusion.. The results of DTI tractography can be reliably integrated into the neuronavigation system using the described method. The use of tractography is beneficial for the optimal planning of the surgical trajectory and the extent of the resection.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber tractography is routinely used in clinical applications to visualize major white matter tracts, such as the corticospinal tract (CST), optic radiation (OR), and arcuate fascicle (AF). Nevertheless, DTI is limited due to its capability of resolving intra-voxel multi-fiber populations. Sophisticated models often require long acquisition times not applicable in clinical practice. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), as an extension of DTI, combines sophisticated modeling of the diffusion process with short acquisition times but has rarely been investigated in fiber tractography. In this study, DTI- and DKI-based fiber tractography of the CST, OR, and AF was investigated in healthy volunteers and glioma patients. For the CST, significantly larger tract volumes were seen in DKI-based fiber tractography. Similar results were obtained for the OR, except for the right OR in patients. In the case of the AF, results of both models were comparable with DTI-based fiber tractography showing even significantly larger tract volumes in patients. In the case of the CST and OR, DKI-based fiber tractography contributes to advanced visualization under clinical time constraints, whereas for the AF, other models should be considered.

N2  -  Objective: This study aimed to assess the operability of thalamic tumors since they are generally considered to be inoperable and to have poor outcomes. Advancements in neuroimaging, neuronavigational technology, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring allow accurate planning and safe resection.
Methods: Clinical data and reports of 10 pediatric patients with thalamic tumors were retrieved retrospectively. All 10 patients underwent surgical intervention. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) was used preoperatively to select the safest surgical route. Intraoperative MRI and postoperative MRI were used to evaluate the extent of resection.; Results: There were three gross total resections (GTRs), two subtotal resections (STRs), two partial resections (PRs), and three biopsies. All patients had unilateral thalamic tumors. Different surgical approaches were used according to the relationship with the internal capsule and corticospinal tract and according to the preoperative DTI. Five patients had pilocytic astrocytoma, two had diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, one had ganglioglioma, one had pediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma, and one had atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). The outcomes of low-grade tumors were favorable, especially for those who underwent resection, and those of high-grade tumors were poor regardless of the extent of resection.; Conclusion: Our review shows that surgical resection of thalamic tumors can be done safely and offers favorable outcomes for patients with low-grade tumors, even without adjuvant therapy. Our study provides further evidence for thalamic tumors operability and safe resection.

N2  -  Purpose: To elucidate morphologic correlates of brain dysfunction in pediatric survivors of posterior fossa tumors by using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine neuroaxonal integrity in white matter.
Patients and Methods: Seventeen medulloblastoma (MB) patients who had received surgery and adjuvant treatment, 13 pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) patients who had been treated only with surgery, and age-matched healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging on a 3-Tesla system. High-resolution conventional T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and DTI data sets were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics, a part of the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library.; Results: Compared with control subjects, FA values of MB patients were significantly decreased in the cerebellar midline structures, in the frontal lobes, and in the callosal body. Fractional anisotropy values of the PA patients were not only decreased in cerebellar hemispheric structures as expected, but also in supratentorial parts of the brain, with a distribution similar to that in MB patients. However, the amount of significantly decreased FA was greater in MB than in PA patients, underscoring the aggravating neurotoxic effect of the adjuvant treatment.; Conclusions: Neurotoxic mechanisms that are present in PA patients (e.g., internal hydrocephalus and damaged cerebellar structures affecting neuronal circuits) contribute significantly to the alteration of supratentorial white matter in pediatric posterior fossa tumor patients.

N2  -  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography are established methods to reconstruct major white matter tracts in the human brain in-vivo. Particularly in the context of neurosurgical procedures, reliable information about the course of fiber bundles is important to minimize postoperative deficits while maximizing the tumor resection volume. Since routinely used deterministic streamline tractography approaches often underestimate the spatial extent of white matter tracts, a novel approach to improve fiber segmentation is presented here, considering clinical time constraints. Therefore, fiber tracking visualization is enhanced with statistical information from multiple tracking applications to determine uncertainty in reconstruction based on clinical DTI data. After initial deterministic fiber tracking and centerline calculation, new seed regions are generated along the result's midline. Tracking is applied to all new seed regions afterwards, varying in number and applied offset. The number of fibers passing each voxel is computed to model different levels of fiber bundle membership. Experimental results using an artificial data set of an anatomical software phantom are presented, using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as a measure of segmentation quality. Different parameter combinations were classified to be superior to others providing significantly improved results with DSCs of 81.02%+/- 4.12%, 81.32%+/- 4.22% and 80.99%+/- 3.81% for different levels of added noise in comparison to the deterministic fiber tracking procedure using the two-ROI approach with average DSCs of 65.08%+/- 5.31%, 64.73%+/- 6.02% and 65.91%+/- 6.42%. Whole brain tractography based on the seed volume generated by the calculated seeds delivers average DSCs of 67.12%+/- 0.86%, 75.10%+/- 0.28% and 72.91%+/- 0.15%, original whole brain tractography delivers DSCs of 67.16%, 75.03% and 75.54%, using initial ROIs as combined include regions, which is clearly improved by the repeated fiber tractography method.

N2  -  Simple Summary Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an image-guided tool, especially in brain tumor resection surgery. Neuroimaging tools are essential for operative planning, particularly for maximizing tumor resection and, at the same time, preserving brain function. In this systematic review, we discuss the utilization of DTI in brain tumor resection, by looking into its ability to assess the perioperative approach, as well as evaluating its benefits for successful surgery. The present study proposes to use DTI as a vital neuroimaging tool for preoperative planning in brain tumor resection surgery. The diffusion tensor imaging technique has been recognized as a neuroimaging tool for in vivo visualization of white matter tracts. However, DTI is not a routine procedure for preoperative planning for brain tumor resection. Our study aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of DTI and the outcomes of surgery. The electronic databases, PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus, were searched for relevant studies. Studies were systematically reviewed based on the application of DTI in pre-surgical planning, modification of operative planning, re-evaluation of preoperative DTI data intraoperatively, and the outcome of surgery decisions. Seventeen studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies agreed that preoperative planning using DTI improves postoperative neuro-deficits, giving a greater resection yield and shortening the surgery time. The results also indicate that the re-evaluation of preoperative DTI intraoperatively assists in a better visualization of white matter tract shifts. Seven studies also suggested that DTI modified the surgical decision of the initial surgical approach and the rate of the GTR in tumor resection surgery. The utilization of DTI may give essential information on white matter tract pathways, for a better surgical approach, and eventually reduce the risk of neurologic deficits after surgery.

N2  -  Background and Objectives: This article aims to investigate the subcortical microanatomy of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and angular gyrus (AnG) using a microfiber dissection technique and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)/fiber tractography (FT). The cortical and subcortical structures of this region are highly functional, and their lesions often present clinically. For this reason, the possibility of post-surgical deficits is high. We focused on the supramarginal gyrus and the angular gyrus and reviewed their anatomy from a topographic, functional and surgical point of view, and aimed to raise awareness especially for neurosurgeons. Methods: Four previously frozen, formalin-fixed human brains were examined under the operating microscope using the fiber dissection technique. Four hemispheres were dissected from medial to lateral under the surgical microscope. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 20 healthy adults was examined. Pre-central and post-central gyrus were preserved to achieve topographic dominance in dissections of brain specimens. Each stage was photographed. Tractographic brain magnetic resonance imaging of 10 healthy adults was examined radiologically. Focusing on the supramarginal and angular gyrus, the white matter fibers passing under this region and their intersection areas were examined. These two methods were compared anatomically from the lateral view and radiologically from the sagittal view. Results: SMG and AnG were determined in brain specimens. The pre-central and post-central gyrus were topographically preserved. The superior and medial temporal gyrus, and inferior and superior parietal areas were decorticated from lateral to medial. U fibers, superior longitudinal fasciculus II (SLF II), superior longitudinal fasciculus III (SLF III), arcuat fasciculus (AF) and middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF) fiber groups were shown and subcortical fiber structures belonging to these regions were visualized by the DTI/FT method. The subcortical fiber groups under the SMG and the AnG were observed anatomically and radiologically to have a dense and complex structure. Conclusions: Due to the importance of the subcortical connections of SMG and AnG on speech function, tumoral lesions and surgeries of this region are of particular importance. The anatomical architecture of the complex subcortical structure, which is located on the projection of the SMG and AnG areas, was shown with a DTI/FT examination under a topographic dominance, preserving the pre-central and post-central gyrus. In this study, the importance of the anatomical localization, connections and functions of the supramarginal and angular gyrus was examined. More anatomical and radiological studies are needed to better understand this region and its connections.

N2  -  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with brain Volume loss, but there is little information on the regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes that contribute to overall loss. Since axonal injury is a common occurrence in TBI, imaging methods that are sensitive to WM damage Such as diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) may be useful for characterizing microstructural brain injury contributing to regional WM loss in TBI. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI were used to evaluate regional changes in TBI patients compared to matched controls. Patients received neuropsychological testing and were imaged approximately 2 months and 12.7 months post-injury. Paradoxically, neuropsychological function improved from Visit I to Visit 2, while voxel-based analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) from the DTI images, and voxel-based analyses of the GM and WM probability maps from the T1-weighted images, mainly revealed significantly greater deleterious GM and WM change over time in patients compared to controls. Cross-sectional comparisons of the DTI measures indicated that patients have decreased FA and increased MID compared to controls over large regions of the brain. TBI affected virtually all of the major fiber bundles in the brain including the corpus callosum, cingulum, the superior and inferior longitudinal fascicules, the uncinate fasciculus, and brain stern fiber tracts. The results indicate that both GM and WM degeneration are significant contributors to brain volume loss in the months following brain injury, and also suggest that DTI measures may be more useful than high-resolution anatomical images in assessment of group differences.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) have the ability to noninvasively visualize changes in white matter tracts, as well as their relationships with lesions and other structures. DTI/DTT has been increasingly used to improve the safety and results of surgical treatment for lesions in eloquent areas, such as brainstem cavernous malformations. This study aimed to investigate the application value of DTI/DTT in brainstem glioma surgery and to validate the spatial accuracy of reconstructed corticospinal tracts (CSTs).
METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on 54 patients with brainstem gliomas who had undergone surgery from January 2016 to December 2018 at Beijing Tiantan Hospital. All patients underwent preoperative DTI and tumor resection with the assistance of DTT-merged neuronavigation and electrophysiological monitoring. Preoperative conventional MRI and DTI data were collected, and the muscle strength and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score before and after surgery were measured. The surgical plan was created with the assistance of DTIDTT findings. The accuracy of DTIDTT was validated by performing direct subcortical stimulation (DsCS) intraoperatively. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between quantitative parameters of DTIDTT (such as the CST score and tumor-to-CST distance RCN and postoperative muscle strength and mRS scores.; RESULTS Among the 54 patients, 6 had normal bilateral CSTs, 12 patients had unilateral CST impairments, and 36 had bilateral CSTs involved. The most common changes in the CSTs were deformation (n = 29), followed by deviation (n = 28) and interruption (n = 27). The surgical approach was changed in 18 cases (33.3%) after accounting for the DTIDTT results. Among 55 CSTs on which DsCS was performed, 46 (83.6%) were validated as spatially accurate by DsCS. The CST score and TCD were significantly correlated with postoperative muscle strength (r = -0.395, p < 0.001, and r = 0.275, p = 0.004, respectively) and postoperative mRS score (r = 0.430, p = 0.001, and r = -0.329, p = 0.015, respectively). The CST score was independently linearly associated with postoperative muscle strength (t = -2.461, p = 0.016) and the postoperative mRS score (t = 2.052, p = 0.046).; CONCLUSIONS DTIDTT is a valuable tool in the surgical management of brainstem gliomas. With good accuracy, it can help optimize surgical planning, guide tumor resection, and predict the postoperative muscle strength and postoperative quality of life of patients.

N2  -  Ethnopharmacological relevance: Trillium tschonoskii Maxim. is one of traditional Chinese medical herbs that has been utilized to treat brain damages and cephalalgia. The neuroprotective effect of total saponins from Trillium tschonoskii rhizome (TSTT) has been demonstrated efficacy in rats following ischemia. However, the axonal remodeling effect of TSTT and the detailed mechanisms after ischemic stroke have not been investigated. Aim of the study: We aimed to estimate therapeutic role of TSTT in axonal remodeling using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, and explored possible mechanisms underlying this process followed by histological assays in ischemic rats. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats underwent permanently focal cerebral ischemia induced by occluding right permanent middle cerebral artery. TSTT was intragastrically administrated 6 h after surgery and once daily for consecutive 15 days. Neurological function was assessed by the motor deficit score and beam walking test. T2 relaxation mapping and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were applied for detecting cerebral tissues damages and microstructural integrity of axons. Luxol fast blue (LFB) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were performed to evaluate histopathology in myelinated axons. Double immunofluorescent staining was conducted to assess oligodendrogenesis. Furthermore, the protein expressions regarding to axonal remodeling related signaling pathways were detected by Western blot assays. Results: TSTT treatment (65, 33 mg/kg) markedly improved motor function after ischemic stroke. T2 mapping MRI demonstrated that TSTT decreased lesion volumes, and DTI further confirmed that TSTT preserved axonal microstructure of the sensorimotor cortex and internal capsule. Meanwhile, diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) showed that TSTT elevated correspondent density and length of fiber in the internal capsule. These MRI measurements were confirmed by histological examinations. Notably, TSTT significantly increased Ki67/NG2, Ki67/ CNPase double-labeled cells along the boundary zone of ischemic cortex and striatum. Meanwhile, TSTT treatment up-regulated the phosphorylation level of Ser 9 in GSK-3 beta, and down-regulated phosphorylated beta-catenin and CRMP-2 expression. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings indicated that TSTT (65, 33 mg/kg) enhanced post-stroke functional recovery, amplified endogenous oligodendrogenesis and promoted axonal regeneration. The beneficial role of TSTT might be correlated with GSK-3/beta-catenin/CRMP-2 modulating axonal reorganization after ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Background: This study assesses the tract alterations observed before and after resection of solid posterior fossa tumors (PFTs) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and white matter tractography (WMT). Materials and Methods: Pre- and post-surgical DTI and WMT data were acquired in eight patients undergoing surgical resections of PFT. A tensor deflection algorithm was used to reconstruct the tracts adjacent to the lesions. The tracts were evaluated regarding their spatial orientation and integrity. A software additionally assessed the luminosity and pixel values from specific regions of interest (ROIs) quantifying the magnitude of tract alterations. The individual neurological condition was additionally evaluated. Results: In eight tumors (metastases (4), neurinomas (2) and meningiomas (2), the preoperative WMT revealed different tract alterations, including deviation (all cases), deformation (7 cases), thinning (8 cases) and apparent tract interruption (4 cases). The ROI histograms from noncompromised tracts showed a tendency for value concentration and peak formation, while affected tracts showed different dispersion patterns. After tumor resection, the compromised white matter tracts showed a resolution (3 cases) or reduction (5 cases) of the deviation. Postoperatively, 7 cases of tract thinning and 3 cases with tract interruptions showed an improvement. The comparison between ROI histograms from preoperative and postoperative compromised tracts mostly revealed a postoperative accentuated reduction of the luminosity with a simultaneous increase of pixels and improved histogram definition (homogeneous values distribution). At this time (5 weeks post-surgery), several neurological functions had improved to different levels. Conclusions: Preoperative and postoperative tract alterations in patients with solid PFT can be accurately assessed with WMT. The magnitude of tract changes can be quantitatively analyzed by assessing color, signal brightness in compromised bundles.

N2  -  Aim of the study. This study aimed to verify the accuracy of preoperative visualisation of the facial nerve (FN) by magnetic resonance-based (MR) diffusion tensor imaging-fibre tracking (DTI-FT) with neuronavigation system integration in patients with cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) tumours.
Clinical rationale for the study. Complete excision with preservation of the FN remains the critical goal of today's vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery. DTI-FT of the FN with neuronavigation is yet to be fully evaluated, and could make surgery safer.; Materials and methods. This was a prospective cohort study in which 38 consecutive patients with a CPA tumour (32 VSs, five meningiomas and one epidermoid cyst) were operated on via the retrosigmoid route from 2013 to 2019. The course of the FN was simulated before surgery using StealthViz and the images were transferred to the Medtronic S7 neuronavigation system. The FN location reconstructed by DTI-FT was verified during the surgery.; Results. MR acquisition was inappropriate in three patients (7.9%). DTI-FT correctly predicted the course of the FN in 31 of the 38 patients; the discordance rate was 18.4%. The accuracy of DTI-FT was 81.6% (95% CI: 65.67-92.26), sensitivity 88.57% (95%CI: 73.26-96.80) and positive predictive value was 91.18% (95% CI: 90.17-92.09). The reliability of the neuronavigation-integrated visualisation of the FN did not depend on the tumour size (p = 0.85), but the method was more accurate when the nerve was compact in shape (p = 0.03, area under curve (AUC) 0.87, 95% CI: 0.60-1.00) and in females (p = 0.04, AUC 0.78, 95% CI: 0.56-1.00). Following surgery, 86.5% ofthe patients presented with useful facial function (House-Brackmann grades I-III). Correct simulation of the FN did not prevent postoperative facial palsy (p = 0.35).; Conclusions. The accuracy of DTI-FT of the FN integrated with neuronavigation remains unsatisfactory. This method does not provide any clinical benefit over non-integrated DTI-FT in terms of nerve function preservation.; Clinical implications. Due to the low reliability of the predictions, further technical advances in predicting the course of the FN are awaited by clinicians. However, DTI-FT images in the operating theatre would make tumour excision more comfortable for the surgeon.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor and diffusion-weighted spinal cord imaging remain relatively unexplored techniques despite demonstrations that such images can be obtained and may yield clinically relevant findings. In this study, we examined the temporal dynamics of spinal cord motion and their impact on diffusion tensor image quality.
METHODS: Four healthy volunteers underwent phase contrast-based velocity mapping and segmented echo-planar diffusion tensor scans of the cervical spinal cord. Regions of interest in the cord were used to identify the temporal patterns of motion. The delay of data acquisition after the cardiac trigger was varied to correspond to either quiescence or motion of the cord.; RESULTS: The cervical spinal cord consistently displayed maximal velocities in the range of 0.5 cms and accelerations of up to 25 cms(2). In both these respects, the cervical cord values were greater thin those of the medulla. Despite this pronounced motion, approximately 40% of the cardiac cycle can be described as relatively calm, with absolute velocities and accelerations less than 20% of the maximum values. Confining image acquisition to this window reduced ghosting artifacts and increased the consistency with which the dominant direction of diffusion was along the rostral-caudal axis in both gray and white matter of the spine. Preliminary clinical application and fiber tracking in pathologic cases was feasible, and alterations of the diffusion properties by multiple sclerosis lesions, tumor, and syringomyelia were seen.; CONCLUSIONS: Acquiring DTI data during the quiescent phase of spinal cord motion can reduce ghosting artifacts and improve fiber tracking.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The present study analyzed the benefits of the use of tractography in the preoperative and intraoperative scenarios.
METHODS: We present a prospective cohort study with 2 groups of patients who had undergone awake surgery for brain tumor resection. A control group for which no intraoperative navigated diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used (non-DTI group) and the case group (DTI group). The operative time, complete tumor resection, and neurological postoperative deficits were measured as primary outcomes. A secondary analysis was performed to determine the power of preoperative DTI to predict for complete tumor resection.; RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included, 18 in the non-DTI group and 19 in the DTI group. No differences were found between the 2 groups for sex, mean age, tumor histological findings, and preoperative mean tumor volume. The awake surgical time in the non-DTI group was 119.8 +- 31.1 minutes and 93.6 +- 12.2 minutes in the DTI group (P = 0.007). A trend was found toward complete tumor resection in the DTI group (P = 0.09). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting complete tumor resection were 88% and 62.5% for the non-DTI group and 100% and 80% for the DTI group, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.720 in the non-DTI group and 0.966 in the DTI group (P = 0.041).; CONCLUSIONS: lntraoperative navigated tractography shortened the time of awake neuro-oncological surgery and might provide help in performing complete tumor resection. Also, tractography used in the preoperative planning could be a useful tool for better prediction of complete tumor resection.

N2  -  Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) are believed to play an important role in a subset of major depression (MD). We aimed to describe the impact of WMLs on white matter pathways in MD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging. As a novel approach, we used DTI tractography to assess pathways intersected by WMLs. We examined 22 patients with late-onset MD and 22 age- and gender-matched controls. Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were obtained to describe tissue integrity. The association between depression severity and the tract-specific localization of WMLs was analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We showed a significant positive association between depression severity and fiber tracts intersected by WMLs in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right uncinate fasciculus. In both groups, WMLs had significantly lower FA and MTR, and higher ADC than both the tracts they intersected and the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In turn, the tracts intersected by WMLs had significantly lower FA and higher ADC than the NAWM. In conclusion, depression severity correlates with the tract-specific localization of WMLs. WMLs have a pronounced effect on white matter integrity in the pathways they intersect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Visualization of subcortical language pathways by means of diffusion tensor imaging - fiber tracking (DTI-FT) is evolving as an important tool for surgical planning and decision making in patients with language-suspect brain tumors. Repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) cortical language mapping noninvasively provides additional functional information. Efforts to incorporate rTMS data into DTI-FT are promising, but the lack of established protocols makes it hard to assess clinical utility. The authors performed DTI-FT of important language pathways by using five distinct approaches in an effort to evaluate the respective clinical usefulness of each approach.
METHODS Thirty patients with left-hemispheric perisylvian lesions underwent preoperative rTMS language mapping and DTI. FT of the principal language tracts was conducted according to different strategies: Ia, anatomical landmark based; Ib, lesion focused landmark based; IIa, rTMS based; IIb, rTMS based with postprocessing; and III, rTMS enhanced (based on a combination of structural and functional data). The authors analyzed the respective success of each method in revealing streamlines and conducted a multinational survey with expert clinicians to evaluate aspects of clinical utility.; RESULTS The authors observed high usefulness and accuracy ratings for anatomy-based approaches (Ia and Ib). Postprocessing of rTMS-based tractograms (IIb) led to more balanced perceived information content but did not improve the usefulness for surgical planning and risk assessment. Landmark-based tractography (Ia and Ib) was most successful in delineating major language tracts (98% success), whereas rTMS-based tractography (IIa and IIb) frequently failed to reveal streamlines and provided less complete tractograms than the landmark-based approach (p < 0.001). The lesion-focused landmark-based (Ib) and the rTMS-enhanced (III) approaches were the most preferred methods.; CONCLUSIONS The lesion-focused landmark-based approach (Ib) achieved the best ratings and enabled visualization of the principal language tracts in almost all cases. The rTMS-enhanced approach (III) was positively evaluated by the experts because it can reveal cortico-subcortical connections, but the functional relevance of these connections is still unclear. The use of regions of interest derived solely from cortical rTMS mapping (IIa and IIb) leads to cluttered images that are of limited use in clinical practice.

N2  -  Background: Previous studies have reported white matter (WM) brain alterations in asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Methods: We compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived WM fractional anisotropy (FA) between HIV-patients with and without mild macroscopic brain lesions determined using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We furthermore investigated whether WM alterations co-occurred with neurocognitive deficits and depression. We performed structural MRI and DTI for 19 patients and 19 age-matched healthy controls. Regionally-specific WM integrity was investigated using voxel-based statistics of whole-brain FA maps and region-of-interest analysis. Each patient underwent laboratory and neuropsychological tests.; Results: Structural MRI revealed no lesions in twelve (HIV-MRN) and unspecific mild macrostructural lesions in seven patients ( HIV-MRL). Both analyses revealed widespread FA-alterations in all patients. Patients with HIV-MRL had FA-alterations primarily adjacent to the observed lesions and, whilst reduced in extent, patients with HIV- MRN also exhibited FA-alterations in similar regions. Patients with evidence of depression showed FA-increase in the ventral tegmental area, pallidum and nucleus accumbens in both hemispheres, and patients with evidence of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder showed widespread FA-reduction.; Conclusion: These results show that patients with HIV-MRN have evidence of FA-alterations in similar regions that are lesioned in HIV-MRL patients, suggesting common neuropathological processes. Furthermore, they suggest a biological rather than a reactive origin of depression in HIV-patients.

N2  -  Pre-operative tractography of the optic radiation (OR) has been advised to assess the risk for postoperative visual field deficit (VFD) in certain candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography relies on a precise anatomical determination of start and target regions of interest (ROls), such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). The post-chiasmal visual pathway and VI show considerable inter-individual variability, and in epilepsy patients parenchymatous lesions might further complicate this matter. A functionally based tractography (FBT) seems beneficial for precise OR identification. We assessed practicability of FBT for OR identification in a patient with occipital lobe epilepsy due to a temporo-occipital maldevelopmental tumor. The MRI protocol at 3T included a T1-weighted sagittal 3D scan, a T2-weighted axial 2D scan and a DTI scan using an echo planar spin echo sequence. ROls for fiber tracking of OR (LGN & Vi) were determined with T2*-weighted fMRI-based retinotopic assessment. After DTI pre-processing and fiber tracking, paths with similar properties were combined in clusters for visual presentation and OR localization. Retinotopic phase maps allowed for the identification of V1 and LGN for a precise DTI-based reconstruction of OR, which was distant to the patient's tumor. Location and structure of ORs were comparable in each hemisphere. FBT could thus influence the human research of the extrastriate visual pathway and the risk management of post-operative VFD in epilepsy surgery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on measuring the random Brownian motion of water molecules within the biological tissues and is particularly useful in tumor characterization.
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of DW MRI and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for preoperative grading of astrocytic supratentorial brain tumors.; Patients and Methods: Twenty-three patients (14 females, 9 males, mean age 43 years) with astrocytic supratentorial brain tumors underwent preoperative conventional MR imaging and DWMRI. The minimum, maximum and mean ADC values and the minimum, maximum and mean DWI signal intensities of each tumor were taken by placing several regions of interest in the tumor on DWI images and ADC maps. To assess the relationship between these values and the tumor grade, we used the Mann-Whitney U test and the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the cutoff value of the minimum, maximum and mean ADC values and the minimum, maximum and mean DWI signal intensities that had the best composition of sensitivity and specificity for differentiating low-grade and high-grade astrocytic brain tumors.; Results: According to the pathology reports, 10 patients had low-grade astrocytomas (grades I, II) and 13 patients had high-grade astrocytomas (grades III, IV). The minimum ADC value showed a significantly inverse correlation with astrocytic tumor grade (P = 0.006). The correlation between the maximum ADC value and the maximum DWI signal intensity with tumor grade was direct (P = 0.013, P = 0.035). According to the ROC analysis, the cutoff values of 0.843 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, 2.117 x 10(-3) mm(2)s and 165.2 for the minimum ADC, maximum ADC and maximum DWI respectively, obtained the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas.; Conclusion: Measuring minimum ADC, maximum ADC and maximum DWI signal intensity can provide valuable information for grading of astrocytic supratentorial brain tumors before surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Glioma surgery in eloquent areas remains a challenge because of the risk of postoperative motor deficits.
OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the efficiency of using a combination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography functional neuronavigation and direct subcortical stimulation (DsCS) to yield a maximally safe resection of cerebral glioma in eloquent areas.; METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 58 subjects with an initial diagnosis of primary cerebral glioma within or adjacent to the pyramidal tract (PT). The white matter beneath the resection cavity was stimulated along the PT, which was visualized with DTI tractography. The intercept between the PT border and DsCS site was measured. The sensitivity and specificity of DTI tractography for PT mapping were evaluated. The efficiency of the combined use of both techniques on motor function preservation was assessed.; RESULTS: Postoperative analysis showed gross total resection in 40 patients (69.0%). Seventeen patients (29.3%) experienced postoperative worsening; 1-month motor deficit was observed in 6 subjects (10.3%). DsCS verified a high concordance rate with DTI tractography for PT mapping. The sensitivity and specificity of DTI were 92.6% and 93.2%, respectively. The intercepts between positive DsCS sites and imaged PTs were 2.0 to 14.7 mm (5.2 +- 2.2 mm). The 6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale scores in 50 post-operative subjects were significantly increased compared with their preoperative scores.; CONCLUSION: DTI tractography is effective but not completely reliable in delineating the descending motor pathways. Integration of DTI and DsCS favors patient-specific surgery for cerebral glioma in eloquent areas.

N2  -  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by chronic, unprovoked and recurrent seizures, which are the result of rapid and excessive bioelectric discharges in nerve cells. Neuroimaging is used to detect underlying structural abnormalities which may be associated with epilepsy. This paper reviews the most common abnormalities, such as hippocampal sclerosis, malformations of cortical development and vascular malformation, detected by neuroimaging in patients with epilepsy to help understand the correlation between these changes and the course, treatment and prognosis of epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals structural changes in the brain which are described in this review. Recent studies indicate the usefulness of additional imaging techniques. The use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) improves surgical outcomes in MRI-negative cases of focal cortical dysplasia. Some techniques, such as quantitative image analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fibre tract reconstruction, can detect small malformations-which means that some of the epilepsies can be treated surgically. Quantitative susceptibility mapping may become the method of choice in vascular malformations. Neuroimaging determines appropriate diagnosis and treatment and helps to predict prognosis.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) appears to offer the possibility of adding important information to aid in presurgical planning. Although experience is limited, DTI seems to provide useful local information about the structures near the tumor. In the future, DTI may provide an improved way to monitor intraoperative surgical procedures as well as their effects. Evaluation of the response to treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also become possible. Although DTI has some limitations, its active investigation and further study are clearly warranted.

N2  -  Mapping non-invasively the complex microstructural architecture of the living human brain, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is one of the core imaging modalities in current population studies. For the application in longitudinal population imaging, the dMRI protocol should deliver reliable data with maximum potential for future analysis. With the recent introduction of novel MRI hardware, advanced dMRI acquisition strategies can be applied within reasonable scan time. In this work we conducted a pilot study based on the requirements for high resolution dMRI in a long-term and high throughput population study. The key question was: can diffusion spectrum imaging accelerated by compressed sensing theory (CS-DSI) be used as an advanced imaging protocol for microstructure dMRI in a long-term population imaging study? As a minimum requirement we expected a high level of agreement of several diffusion metrics derived from both CS-DSI and a 3-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) acquisition, an established imaging strategy used in other population studies. A wide spectrum of state-of-the-art diffusion processing and analysis techniques was applied to the pilot study data including quantitative diffusion and microstructural parameter mapping, fiber orientation estimation and white matter fiber tracking. When considering diffusion weighted images up to the same maximum diffusion weighting for both protocols, group analysis across 20 subjects indicates that CS-DSI performs comparable to 3-shell HARDI in the estimation of diffusion and microstructural parameters. Further, both protocols provide similar results in the estimation of fiber orientations and for local fiber tracking. CS-DSI provides high radial resolution while maintaining high angular resolution and it is well-suited for analysis strategies that require high b-value acquisitions, such as CHARMED modeling and biomarkers from the diffusion propagator.

N2  -  Background Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) permits quantitative examination within the pyramidal tract (PT) by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA). To the best of our knowledge, the inter-variability measures of FA along the PT remain unexplained. A clear understanding of these reference values would help radiologists and neuroscientists to understand normality as well as to detect early pathophysiologic changes of brain diseases. The aim of our study was to calculate the variability of the FA at eleven anatomical landmarks along the PT and the influences of gender and cerebral hemisphere in these measurements in a sample of young, healthy volunteers.
Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed in twenty-three right-handed healthy volunteers who underwent magnetic resonance evaluation of the brain. Mean FA values from eleven anatomical landmarks across the PT (at centrum semiovale, corona radiata, posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata) were evaluated using split-plot factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA).; Results We found a significant interaction effect between anatomical landmark and cerebral hemisphere (F (10, 32)=4.516, P=0.001; Wilks' Lambda 0.415, with a large effect size (partial eta(2)=0.585)). The influence of gender and age was non-significant. On average, the midbrain and PLIC FA values were higher than pons and medulla oblongata values; centrum semiovale measurements were higher than those of the corona radiata but lower than PLIC.; Conclusions There is a normal variability of FA measurements along PT in healthy individuals, which is influenced by regions of interest location (anatomical landmarks) and cerebral hemisphere. FA measurements should be reported for comparing same-side and same-landmark PT to help avoid comparisons with the contralateral PT; ideally, normative values should exist for a clinically significant age group. A standardized package of selected DTI processing tools would allow DTI processing to be routinely performed in clinical settings. Chin Med J 2012;125(12):2180-2187

N2  -  Awake surgery and intraoperative neuromonitoring represent the gold standard for surgery of lesion located in language-eloquent areas of the dominant hemisphere, enabling the maximal safe resection while preserving language function. Nevertheless, this functional mapping is invasive; it can be executed only during surgery and in selected patients. Moreover, the number of neuro-oncological bilingual patients is constantly growing, and performing awake surgery in this group of patients can be difficult. In this scenario, the application of accurate, repeatable and non-invasive preoperative mapping procedures is needed, in order to define the anatomical distribution of both languages. Repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rnTMS) associated with functional subcortical fiber tracking (nTMS-based DTI-FT) represents a promising and comprehensive mapping tool to display language pathway and function reorganization in neurosurgical patients. Herein we report a case of a bilingual patient affected by brain tumor in the left temporal lobe, who underwent rnTMS mapping for both languages (Romanian and Italian), disclosing the true eloquence of the anterior part of the lesion in both tests. After surgery, language abilities were intact at follow-up in both languages. This case represents a preliminary application of nTMS-based DTI-FT in neurosurgery for brain tumor in eloquent areas in a bilingual patient.

N2  -  BACKGROUND:Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to demonstrate corticospinal tract (CST) position. Intraoperative brain shifts may limit preoperative DTI value, and studies characterizing such shifts are lacking.OBJECTIVE:To examine tumor characteristics that could predict intraoperative shift in tumor-to-CST distance using high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging.METHODS:We retrospectively evaluated preoperative and intraoperative DTIs, tumor pathology, and imaging characteristics of patients who underwent resection of an intra-axial tumor adjacent to the CST to identify covariates that significantly affected shift in tumor-to-CST distance. For validation, we analyzed data from a separate, 20-patient cohort.RESULTS:In the first cohort, the mean intraoperative shift in the tumor-to-CST distance was 3.18 3.58 mm. The mean shift for the 20 patients with contrast and the 5 patients with non-contrast-enhancing tumors was 3.93 3.64 and 0.18 0.18 mm, respectively (P < .001). No association was found between intraoperative shift in tumor-to-CST distance and tumor pathology, tumor volume, edema volume, preoperative tumor-to-CST distance, or extent of resection. According to receiver-operating characteristic analysis, nonenhancement predicted a tumor-to-CST distance shift of 0.5 mm, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75%. We validated these findings using the second cohort.CONCLUSION:For nonenhancing intra-axial tumors, preoperative DTI is a reliable method for assessing intraoperative tumor-to-CST distance because of minimal intraoperative shift, a finding that is important in the interpretation of subcortical motor evoked potential to maximize extent of resection and to preserve motor function. In resection of intra-axial enhancing tumors, intraoperative imaging studies are crucial to compensate for brain shift.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The authors tested the feasibility of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) seizure circuits. Up to one-third of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) suffer from medically refractory epilepsy requiring surgery. Because current options such as open resection, laser ablation, and Gamma Knife radiosurgery pose potential risks, such as infection, hemorrhage, and ionizing radiation, and because they often produce visual or neuropsychological deficits, the authors developed a noninvasive MRgFUS ablation strategy for mesial temporal disconnection to mitigate these risks.
METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed 3-T MRI scans obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The study group included 10 patients with essential tremor (ET) who underwent pretreatment CT and MRI prior to MRgFUS, and 2 patients with MTS who underwent MRI. Fiber tracking of the fornix-fimbria pathway and inferior optic radiations was performed, ablation sites mimicking targets of open posterior hippocampal disconnection were modeled, and theoretical MRgFUS surgical plans were devised. Distances between the targets and optic radiations were measured, helmet angulations were prescribed, and the numbers of available MRgFUS array elements were calculated.; RESULTS Tractograms of fornix-fimbria and optic radiations were generated in all ET and MTS patients successfully. Of the 10 patients with both the CT and MRI data necessary for the analysis, 8 patients had adequate elements available to target the ablation site. A margin (mean 8.5 mm, range 6.5-9.8 mm) of separation was maintained between the target lesion and optic radiations.; CONCLUSIONS MRgFUS offers a noninvasive option for seizure tract disruption. DTI identifies fornix-fimbria and optic radiations to localize optimal ablation targets and critical surrounding structures, minimizing risk of postoperative visual field deficits. This theoretical modeling study provides the necessary groundwork for future clinical trials to apply this novel neurosurgical technique to patients with refractory MTLE and surgical contraindications, multiple prior surgeries, or other factors favoring noninvasive treatment.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Intramedullary spinal cord neoplasms (ISCN) pose significant management challenges. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (such as diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) have been utilized to determine the infiltrative nature and resectability of ISCN. However, this has not been applied to intraoperative decision making.
OBJECTIVE: To present a case series of 2 patients with ISCN, the first to combine use of DTI, pre- and intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality imaging, and microscope integrated navigation with heads-up display.; METHODS: Two patients who underwent surgery for ISCN were included. DTI images were obtained and 3D images were created using Surgical Theater (Surgical Theater SRP, Version 7.4.0, Cleveland, Ohio). Fiducials were used to achieve accurate surface registration to C4. Navigation confirmed the levels of laminectomy necessary. The microscope was integrated with Brainlab (Brainlab AG Version 3.0.5, Feldkirchen, Germany) and the tumor projected in the heads-up display. Surgical Theater was integrated with Brainlab to allow for real time evaluation of the 3D tractography.; RESULTS: Case 1: All tracts were pushed away from the tumor, suggesting it was not infiltrative. Surgical Theater and Brainlab assisted in confirming midline despite the abnormal swelling of the cord so the myelotomy could be performed. The heads-up display outline demonstrated excellent correlation to the tumor. Gross total resection was achieved. Diagnosis of ependymoma was confirmed. Case 2: Some tracts were going through the tumor itself, suggesting an infiltrative process. Surgical Theater and Brainlab again allowed for confirmation of the midline raphe. Near total resection of the enhancing portion was achieved. Diagnosis of glioblastoma was confirmed.; CONCLUSION: This is a proof of concept application where multi-modal imaging technology was utilized for safest maximal ISCN resection.

N2  -  Visual perception of others' movements is of great value for daily life activities, e. g., for safe car driving or non-verbal communication. While the cortical system for visual perception of body motion has been addressed in a number of studies, the contribution of subcortical structures remains largely unclear. Based on lesion findings in neurosurgical patients indicating eloquence of the left lateral cerebellum, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we could demonstrate that the left lateral cerebellar lobules Crus I and VIIB are involved in visual processing of body motion. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) suggests a reciprocal effective connectivity between the left lateral cerebellum and the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), the cornerstone of the network for biological motion perception. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides the first evidence for a direct bidirectional fibre pathway between the cerebellum and STS. These findings open a new window for future neurological and psychiatric research.

N2  -  Infratentorial lesions have been assigned an equivalent weighting to supratentorial plaques in the new McDonald criteria for diagnosing multiple sclerosis. Moreover, their presence has been shown to have prognostic value for disability. However, their spatial distribution and impact on network damage is not well understood. As a preliminary step in this study, we mapped the overall infratentorial lesion pattern in relapsing-remittingmultiple sclerosis patients (N = 317) using MRI, finding the pons (lesion density, 14.25/cm(3)) and peduncles (13.38/cm(3)) to be predilection sites for infratentorial lesions. Based on these results, 118 fiber bundles from 15 healthy controls and a subgroup of 23 patients showing lesions unilaterally at the predilection sites were compared using diffusion tensor imaging to analyze the impact of an isolated infratentorial lesion on the affected fiber tracts. Fractional an-isotropy, mean diffusion as well as axial and radial diffusivity were investigated at the lesion site and along the entire fiber tract. Infratentorial lesions were found to have an impact on the fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity not only at the lesion site itself but also along the entire affected fiber tract. As previously found in animal experiments, inflammatory attack in the posterior fossa in multiple sclerosis impacts the whole affected fiber tract. Here, this damaging effect, reflected by changes in diffusivity measures, was detected in vivo in multiple sclerosis patients in early stages of the disease, thus demonstrating the influence of a focal immune attack on more distant networks, and emphasizing the pathophysiological role of Wallerian degeneration in multiple sclerosis.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fluorescein sodium staining (FLS) in the resection of high-grade glioma (HGG) in functional brain areas.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study design. The data of 95 patients who underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University for HGG in functional brain areas from October 2014 to December 2017 were investigated. In the observation group, 49 patients underwent DTI preoperatively and received FLS for the removal of tumor during the operation. In the control group, 46 patients received the routine method. All patients were subjected to enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to assess the extent of tumor resection within 72 hours after operation. The changes in muscle strength and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) scores were evaluated 1 month after surgery.; RESULTS: The extent of resection was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (83.7% vs. 45.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). The rate of muscle strength reduction after surgery was remarkably lower in the observation group than in the control group (20.4% vs. 47.8%, respectively; P = 0.005). KPS scores were higher in the observation group than in the control group (73.5% vs. 47.8%, respectively; P = 0.029). In the observation group, the sensitivity of FLS in identifying tumor tissue was 91.7% (4448), with a specificity of 90.0% (4550).; CONCLUSIONS: The application of DTI with FLS can facilitate the maximum resection of HGG in functional brain areas with minimum loss of fiber tracts, reduce the disability rate, and improve quality of postoperative life compared with traditional glioma surgery.

N2  -  Object: As various recent studies show, damage to white matter pathways leads to permanent functional deficits in a high percentage of patients. Particularly the subcortical language network is complex, and its visualization has a tremendous relevance for neurosurgeons. This pilot study aims to correlate language-eloquent white matter pathways with the course of language function after the resection of left-sided perisylvian gliomas.
Methods: We included 10 patients who underwent resection of highly language-eloquent high- (9 pts) and low-grade gliomas (1 pts). We performed navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS)-based tractography via diffusion tensor imaging fiber trackings (DTI FT) preoperatively (PRE-1), postoperatively (POST-1), and at long-term follow up or tumor recurrence (PRE-2). We separately tracked the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF), the frontal aslant tract (FAT), and the superior longitudinal (SLF), and arcuate fascicle (AF), and correlated the amount of visualized fibers to the patients' language function at each date.; Results: The changes of nrTMS-based DTI FTs of single white matter pathways correlated with the according status of language function for any of the pathways in 80% of patients and in 19 of 30 (63%) single pathway comparisons between PRE-1 and POST-1. Between POST-1 and PRE-2 the nrTMS-based DTI FTs correlated with the status of language function for any of the pathways in all patients and in 24 of 30 (80%) single pathway comparisons. Single FT results correlated with the according status of language function at POST-1 in 60, 70, and 60% of cases, and with the according status of language function at PRE-2 in 60, 90, and 90% of cases for the tracking of the IFOF, FAT, and SLFAF, respectively.; Conclusion: By the present results we were able to show that nrTMS-based DTI FT of the IFOF, FAT, and SLFAF mainly correlates with the according status of language function preoperatively, postoperatively, and at long-term follow up after the resection of left-sided perisylvian gliomas.

N2  -  Physical abuse associated with nonaccidental trauma (NAT) affects approximately 144,000 children per year in the USA and, frequently, these injuries affect the developing brain. Most infants with suspected NAT are initially evaluated by skull X-rays and computed tomography to determine whether fractures are present, the severity of the acute injury and the need for urgent neurosurgical intervention. Increasingly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is conducted as it provides additional diagnostic and prognostic information about the extent and nature of the injury. In this review, we examine 4 MRI techniques as they apply to children who present acutely after NAT. Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a 3-D high-resolution MRI technique that is more sensitive than conventional imaging in detecting hemorrhagic lesions that are often associated with diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy acquires metabolite information reflecting neuronal integrity and function from multiple brain regions and provides a sensitive, noninvasive assessment of neurochemical alterations that offers early prognostic information regarding outcome. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is based on differences in the diffusion of water molecules within the brain and has been shown to be very sensitive in the early detection of ischemic injury. It is now being used to study the direct effects of traumatic injury as well as those due to secondary ischemia. Diffusion tensor imaging is a form of DWI and allows better evaluation of white matter fiber tracts by taking advantage of the intrinsic directionality (anisotropy) of water diffusion in the human brain. It has been shown to be useful in identifying white matter abnormalities after DAI when conventional imaging appears normal. Although these imaging methods have been studied primarily in adults and children with accidental traumatic brain injury, it is clear that they have the potential to provide additional value in the imaging and clinical evaluation of children with NAT.

N2  -  Object: The authors retrospectively analyzed the surgical treatment of adult intrinsic pontine gliomas in their department, and to enhance the understanding of technical strategies to treat this disease. Methods: 7 patients with intrinsic pontine gliomas were recruited for this study, between January 2011 and June 2013. All patients underwent preoperative MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fiber Tracking (DTI-FT). In addition, multimodal Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IOM) and Intraoperative Neuronavigation were also applied during microsurgery. Results: 7 patients with intrinsic pontine gliomas were treated at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Mean age, mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, and mean duration of follow-up average time were 38.0 years, 2.0 months, and 23.4 months, respectively. The main presentations were progressive cranial nerve deficits and long tract signs. Total resection was achieved in 3 patients, subtotal resection in 2, and partial resection in 2. Postoperative pathological examination revealed: astrocytoma (WHO II) in 4 cases, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AO, WHO III) in one case, and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA, WHO III) in two cases. Postoperative radiotherapy were administered to all patients, and 4 patients with astrocytoma (WHO II) rejected chemotherapy. After 11-39 months of follow-up, patient symptoms were resolved or stable without aggravation except one patient died because of rapidly progressive glioma at 11 months after operation. MRI in other patients showed residual tumor size to be unchanged or without obviously recurrence. Conclusion: Combining preoperative MRI with preoperative DTI-FT, surgery can be better assessed and the operation for adult intrinsic pontine gliomas can be maximally and safely resected with the aid of Multimodal IOMs and Intraoperative Navigation during microsurgery.

N2  -  Remote neurodegenerative changes in supraspinal white matter (WM) can manifest after central lesions such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The majority of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies use traditional metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) to investigate microstructural changes in cerebral WM after SCI. However, interpretation of FA readouts is often challenged by inherent limitations of the tensor model. Recent developments in novel diffusion markers, such as fiber density (FD), allows more accurate depictions of WM pathways and has shown more reliable quantification of WM alterations compared to FA in recent studies of neurological diseases. This study investigated if FD provides useful characterization of supraspinal WM integrity after SCI in addition to the traditional DTI readouts. FA, MD, and FD maps were derived from diffusion datasets of 20 patients with chronic SCI and compared with 19 healthy controls (HC). Group differences were investigated across whole brain WM using tract-based spatial statistics and averaged diffusion values of the corticospinal tract (CST) and thalamic radiation (TR) were extracted for comparisons between HC and SCI subgroups. We also related diffusion readouts of the CST and TR with clinical scores of sensorimotor function. To investigate which diffusion markers of the CST and TR delineate HC and patients with SCI a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Overall, patients with an SCI showed decreased FA of the TR and CST. ROC analysis differentiated HC and SCI based on diffusion markers of large WM tracts including FD of the TR. Furthermore, patients' motor function was positively correlated with greater microstructural integrity of the CST. While FD showed the strongest correlation, motor function was also associated with FA and MD of the CST. In summary, microstructural changes of supraspinal WM in patients with SCI can be detected using FD as a complementary marker to traditional DTI readouts and correlates with their clinical characteristics. Future DTI studies may benefit from utilizing this novel marker to investigate complex large WM tracts in patient cohorts with varying presentations of SCI or neurodegenerative diseases.

N2  -  A 17-year-old patient with a symptomatic cavernoma of the optic radiation underwent surgery supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and navigated 3D-ultrasound. The primary visual cortex was visualized with fMRI. The optic radiation was delineated by means of DWI. The diffusion weigthed images were used for 3-dimensional reconstruction of the optic radiation. During surgery, the information of the localisation of functional brain regions were used together with the 3D-ultrasound, enabling the surgeon to remove the cavernoma without morbidity. This is the first report of the combined use of fMRI, fiber tract imaging and 3D-ultrasound for the safe resection of an optic radiation lesion.

N2  -  We present a method for the detection and quantification of white matter infiltration from human brain tumours based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Since white matter destruction alters the local diffusion properties, DTI has the potential to sensitively detect tumour infiltration and to quantify the degree thereof Here, we consider three tumour patients with gliomas, two with and one without contralateral tumour progress. We use DTI to identify specific fibre systems, where infiltration has to be assessed. On this basis, the problem of arbitrary region of interest definition is solved such that tumour infiltration can be reliably quantified in particular fibre bundles. It is demonstrated at the Corpus Callosum (CC) and the Pyramidal Tract (PT) that fibre bundle infiltration can be well detected by specific visualisation techniques of diffusion tensor data. Infiltration of the CC is quantified by using a reliable method for the determination of diffusion properties inside particular fibre bundles. For an age normalised quantification of white matter infiltration we introduce the Integrity Index, which measures the diffusion anisotropy inside an infiltrated fibre bundle normalised by the diffusion anisotropy in a specific region of healthy fibre tissue. It turns out that the quantification of CC infiltration correlates with contralateral tumour progression and has the potential to serve as a surrogate marker for this process, which is crucial for surgical therapy decisions and intervention planning.

N2  -  We evaluated the effects of neural progenitor cell treatment of stroke on white matter reorganization using MRI. Male Wistar rats (n = 26) were subjected to 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with neural progenitor cells (n = 17) or without treatment (n = 9) and were sacrificed at 5-7 weeks thereafter. MRI measurements revealed that grafted neural progenitor cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic boundary regions. White matter reorganization confirmed histologically, was coincident with increases of fractional anisotropy (FA, P < 0.01) after stroke in the ischemic recovery regions compared to that in the ischemic core region in both treated and control groups. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral striatum bounding the lesion areas after stroke. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging revealed similar orientation patterns to the immunohistological results. Complementary measurements in stroke patients indicated that FT maps exhibit an overall orientation parallel to the lesion boundary. Our data demonstrate that FA and FT identify and characterize cerebral tissue undergoing white matter reorganization after stroke and treatment with neural progenitor cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background: An assessment of the degree of white matter tract injury is important in neurosurgical planning for patients with gliomas. The main objective of this study was to assess the injury grade of the corticospinal tract (CST) in rats with glioma using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Methods: A total 17 rats underwent 7.0T MRI on day 10 after tumor implantation. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were acquired in the tumor, peritumoral and contralateral areas, and the ADC ratio (ipsilateral ADCcontralateral ADC) and rFA (relative FA = ipsilateral FA contralateral FA) in the peritumoral areas were measured. The CST injury was divided into three grades and delineated by diffusion tensor tractography reconstruction imaging. The fiber density index (FDi) of the ipsilateral and contralateral CST and rFDi (relative FDi = ipsilateral FDicontralateral FDi) in the peritumoral areas were measured. After the mice were sacrificed, the invasion of glioma cells and fraction of proliferating cells were observed by hematoxylin-eosin and Ki67 staining in the tumor and peritumoral areas. The correlations among the pathology results, CST injury grade and DTI parameter values were calculated using a Spearman correlation analysis. One-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the different CST injury grade by the rFA, rFDi and ADC ratio values.; Results: The tumor cells and proliferation index were positively correlated with the CST injury grade (r = 0.8857, 0.9233, P < 0.001). A negative correlation was demonstrated between the tumor cells and the rFA and rFDi values in the peritumoral areas (r = -0.8571, -0.5588), and the proliferation index was negatively correlated with the rFA and rFDi values (r = -0.8571, -0.5588), while the ADC ratio was not correlated with the tumor cells or proliferation index. The rFA values between the CST injury grades (1 and 3, 2 and 3) and the rFDi values in grades 1 and 3 significantly differed (P < 0.05).; Conclusions: Diffusion tensor imaging may be used to quantify the injury degrees of CST involving brain glioma in rats. Our data suggest that these quantitative parameters may be used to enhance the efficiency of delineating the relationship between fiber tracts and malignant tumor.

N2  -  Purpose: This study proposes and assesses a new diffusion MRI (dMRI) technique to solve problems related to the quantification of parameter maps (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] or mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA]) and misdrawing of fiber tractography (FT) due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-partial volume effects (PVEs) for brain tissues by combining with the T2-based water suppression (T2wsup) technique.
Methods: T2wsup-diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images were obtained by subtracting those images from the acquired multi -b value (b) DWI images after correcting the signal intensities of multiecho time (TE) images using long TE water signal-dominant images. Quantitative parameter maps and FT were obtained from minimum data points and were compared with those using the standard (without wsup) DWI method, and partly compared with those obtained using other alternative DWI methods of applying fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), non -b-zero (NBZ) by theoretical or noise-added simulation and MR images.; Results: In the T2wsup-dMRI method, the hyperintense artifacts due to CSF-PVEs in MRI data were dramatically suppressed even at lower b (less than or similar to 500 smm(2)) while keeping the tissue SNR. The quantitative parameter map values became precisely close to the pure tissue values precisely even in water (CSF) PVE voxels in healthy brain tissues (T2 less than or similar to 100 ms). Furthermore, the fiber tracts were correctly connected, particularly at the fornix in closest contact to the CSF.; Conclusion: Solving the problem of CSF-PVE in the current dMRI technique using our proposed T2wsup-dMRI technique is easy, with higher SNR than those obtained with FLAIR or NBZ methods when applying to healthy brain tissues. The proposed T2wsup-dMRI could be useful in clinical settings, although further optimization of the pulse sequence and processing techniques and clinical assessments are required, particularly for long T2 lesions.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine whether indomethacin and propofol induce cerebral ischemic damage in patients undergoing craniotomy for cerebral tumors. As a secondary aim, the authors investigated whether low jugular bulb oxygen saturation values were associated with brain parenchymal damage as evaluated by diffusion-weighted imaging.
Methods: Nine patients subjected to craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumors in propofol-fentanyl anesthesia were studied. Magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion- and perfusion-weighted and structural sequences were performed (1) on the day before surgery, (2) before and (3) 20 min after administration of indomethacin (bolus of 0.2 mgkg followed by infusion of 0.2 mg (.) kg(-1) (.) h(-1)) in the propofol-fentanyl-anesthetized patient, and (4) 2 days after surgery. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated. jugular bulb oxygen saturation, arteriovenous oxygen difference, mean arterial blood pressure, and arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions were measured simultaneously with the magnetic resonance examinations performed during anesthesia.; Results: No ischemic lesions were detected in the diffusion-weighted or apparent diffusion coefficient images. A nonsignificant decrease in jugular bulb oxygen saturation from 51% (range, 40-61%) to 43% (range, 37-63%) and increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference from 4.4 mM (range, 2.7-4.6 mM) to 4.7 mM (range, 2.9-5.2 mM) was observed after indomethacin administration.; Conclusion: Administration of indomethacin during propofol anesthesia is not associated with evidence of ischemic damage in patients with brain tumors, as evaluated by diffusion-weighted imaging.

N2  -  Background: Tractography has been widely adopted to improve brain gliomas' surgical planning and guide their resection. This study aimed to evaluate state-of-the-art of arcuate fasciculus (AF) tractography for surgical planning and explore the role of along-tract analyses in vivo for characterizing tumor histopathology.
Methods: High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) images were acquired for nine patients with tumors located in or near language areas (age: 41 +- 14 years, mean +- standard deviation; five males) and 32 healthy volunteers (age: 39 +- 16 years; 16 males). Phonemic fluency task fMRI was acquired preoperatively for patients. AF tractography was performed using constrained spherical deconvolution diffusivity modeling and probabilistic fiber tracking. Along-tract analyses were performed, dividing the AF into 15 segments along the length of the tract defined using the Laplacian operator. For each AF segment, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures were compared with those obtained in healthy controls (HCs). The hemispheric laterality index (LI) was calculated from language task fMRI activations in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe parcellations. Tumors were grouped into lowhigh grade (LGHG).; Results: Four tumors were LG gliomas (one dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor and three glioma grade II) and five HG gliomas (two grade III and three grade IV). For LG tumors, gross total removal was achieved in all but one case, for HG in two patients. Tractography identified the AF trajectory in all cases. Four along-tract DTI measures potentially discriminated LG and HG tumor patients (false discovery rate < 0.1): the number of abnormal MD and RD segments, median AD, and MD measures. Both a higher number of abnormal AF segments and a higher AD and MD measures were associated with HG tumor patients. Moreover, correlations (unadjusted p < 0.05) were found between the parietal lobe LI and the DTI measures, which discriminated between LG and HG tumor patients. In particular, a more rightward parietal lobe activation (LI < 0) correlated with a higher number of abnormal MD segments (R = -0.732) and RD segments (R = -0.724).; Conclusions: AF tractography allows to detect the course of the tract, favoring the safer-as-possible tumor resection. Our preliminary study shows that along-tract DTI metrics can provide useful information for differentiating LG and HG tumors during pre-surgical tumor characterization.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Surgery of lesions within the atrium of the lateral ventricle remains a challenging procedure because of the deep location and the relationship to vascular structures. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of tractography to evaluate the position of white matter tracts located along the course of the surgical access to trigonal and peritrigonal lesions.
METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired in 19 patients. All patients underwent surgical resection of brain tumors. Pre- and postoperative clinical conditions were evaluated by a neurosurgeon, using the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. The corticospinal tract, optic radiation, and arcuate fasciculum were reconstructed because of their location close to the trigonal region. Two neurosurgeons were asked to assess the surgical approach with and without tractography.; RESULTS: According to the tractographic reconstructions, the surgical access was chosen from the middle temporal gyrus in 12 patients (63%) and the posterior parietal gyrus in 7 patients (37%), leading to an a priori change in the surgical approach in 14 patients (73%). Six patients (31%) showed new postsurgical transient symptoms, whereas in 2 patients (10%) the deficits were permanent. After 30 days, the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale evaluation showed an improvement or a substantial stability of symptoms in 90% of cases. In 2 patients, a worsening of 30% of clinical performance was appreciable.; CONCLUSIONS: The use of DTI in preoperative planning of trigonal and peritrigonal lesions may help in description of the best surgical approach for patient; this technique allows to reach the tumors, saving the white matter tracts, when it is possible.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Tailored craniotomies for awake procedures limit cortical exposure. Recently we demonstrated that the identification of eloquent areas increased the risk of postoperative deficits. However, it was not clear whether the observed neurological deficits were caused by proximity of functional cortex to the tumor [cortical injury] or subcortical injury.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that subcortical injury during tumor resection is an important predictor of postoperative neurological deficits compared to cortical injury.; METHODS: A retrospective review of 214 patients undergoing awake craniotomy was carried out in whom preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cortical mapping (CM) were performed. A radiologist blinded to the clinical data reviewed and graded the postoperative changes on diffusion-weighted MR-imaging (DWI).; RESULTS: Of the 40 cases who developed new intraoperative neurological deficit, 36 (90%) occurred during subcortical dissection, 3 (7.5%) during both subcortical and cortical dissection, and 1 (2.5%) during cortical dissection. Neurological dysfunction acquired during subcortical dissection was an independent predictor of postoperative deficits both in the immediate postoperative period (P < .001) and at the 3-month follow-up (P < .001). Significant DWI restriction in the subcortical white matter was predictive of neurological deficits both immediately and at 3 months, P = .011 and P < .001, respectively. New or worsening deficits were seen in 38% of patients; however, at 3 months 13% had a mild persistent neurological deficit.; CONCLUSION: Subcortical injury with significant DWI changes result in postoperative neurological decline despite our efforts to preserve cortical areas of function. This underscores the importance of preserving subcortical fiber tracts during awake craniotomy procedures.

N2  -  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important and novel neuroimaging modality for patients with brain tumors. By non-invasive measurement, localization and lateralization of brain activiation, most importantly of motor and speech function, fMRI facilitates the selection of the most appropriate and sparing treatment and function-preserving surgery. Prerequisites for the diagnostic use of fMRI are the application of dedicated clinical imaging protocols and standardization of the respective imaging procedures. The combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) also enables tracking and visualization of important fiber bundles such as the pyramidal tract and the arcuate fascicle. These multimodal MR data can be implemented in computer systems for functional neuronavigation or radiation treatment. The practicability, accuracy and reliability of presurgical fMRI have been validated by large numbers of published data. However, fMRI cannot be considered as a fully established modality of diagnostic neuroimaging due to the lack of guidelines of the responsible medical associations as well as the lack of medical certification of important hardware and software components. This article reviews the current research in the field and provides practical information relevant for presurgical fMRI.

N2  -  Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) display different preferential locations in eloquent and secondary associative brain areas. The reason for this tendency is still unknown. We hypothesized that the intrinsic architecture and water diffusion properties of the white matter bundles in these regions may facilitate gliomas infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging of sixty-seven diffuse low-grade gliomas patients were normalized to/and segmented in MNI space to create three probabilistic infiltration weighted gradient maps according to the molecular status of each tumor group (IDH mutated, IDH wild-type and IDH mutated/1p19q co-deleted). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)- based parameters were derived for five major white matter bundles, displaying regional differences in the grade of infiltration, averaged over 20 healthy individuals acquired from the Human connectome project (HCP) database. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze fiber density, fiber diameter and g-ratio in 100 human white matter regions, sampled from cadaver specimens, reflecting areas with different gliomas infiltration in each white matter bundle. Histological results and DTI-based parameters were compared in anatomical regions of high- and low grade of infiltration (HIF and LIF) respectively. We detected differences in the white matter infiltration of five major white matter bundles in three groups. Astrocytomas IDHm infiltrated left fronto-temporal subcortical areas. Astrocytomas IDHwt were detected in the posterior-temporal and temporo-parietal regions bilaterally. Oligodendrogliomas IDHm/1p19q infiltrated anterior subcortical regions of the frontal lobes bilaterally. Regional differences within the same white matter bundles were detected by both TEM- and DTI analysis linked to different topographical variables. Our multimodal analysis showed that HIF regions, common to all the groups, displayed a smaller fiber diameter, lower FA and higher RD compared with LIF regions. Our results suggest that the both morphological features and diffusion parameters of the white matter may be different in regions linked to the preferential location of DLGG.

N2  -  BackgroundEfforts to resection of glioma lesions located in brain-eloquent areas must balance the extent of resection (EOR) and functional preservation. Currently, intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) is the gold standard for achieving the maximum EOR while preserving as much functionality as possible. However, intraoperative DES inevitably involves risks of infection and epilepsy. The aim of this study was to verify the reliability of individual-target transcranial magnetic stimulation (IT-TMS) in preoperative mapping relative to DES and evaluate its effectiveness based on postsurgical outcomes. MethodsSixteen language-eloquent glioma patients were enrolled. Nine of them underwent preoperative nTMS mapping (n=9, nTMS group), and the other seven were assigned to the non-nTMS group and did not undergo preoperative nTMS mapping (n=7). Before surgery, online IT-TMS was performed during a language task in the nTMS group. Sites in the cortex at which this task was disturbed in three consecutive trials were recorded and regarded as positive and designated nTMS hotspots (HSnTMS). Both groups then underwent awake surgery and intraoperative DES mapping. DES hotspots (HSDES) were also determined in a manner analogous to HSnTMS. The spatial distribution of HSnTMS and HSDES in the nTMS group was recorded, registered in a single brain template, and compared. The center of gravity (CoG) of HSnTMS (HSnTMS-CoG)-based and HSDES-CoG-based diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking (DTI-FT) was performed. The electromagnetic simulation was conducted, and the values were then compared between the nTMS and DES groups, as were the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scale and fiber-tracking values. ResultsHS(nTMS) and HSDES showed similar distributions (mean distance 6.32 +/- 2.6 mm, distance range 2.2-9.3 mm, 95% CI 3.9-8.7 mm). A higher fractional anisotropy (FA) value in nTMS mapping (P=0.0373) and an analogous fiber tract length (P=0.2290) were observed. A similar distribution of the electric field within the brain tissues induced by nTMS and DES was noted. Compared with the non-nTMS group, the integration of nTMS led to a significant improvement in language performance (WAB scores averaging 78.4 in the nTMS group compared with 59.5 in the non-nTMS group, P=0.0321 < 0.05) as well as in brain-structure preservation (FA value, P=0.0156; tract length, P=0.0166). ConclusionPreoperative IT-TMS provides data equally crucial to DES and thus facilitates precise brain mapping and the preservation of linguistic function.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging tractography permits in vivo visualization of white matter structures. Aside from its academic value, tractography has been proven particularly useful to neurosurgeons for preoperative planning. Preoperative tractography permits both qualitative and quantitative analyses of tumor effects upon surrounding white matter, allowing the surgeon to specifically tailor their operative approach. Despite its benefits, there is controversy pertaining to methodology, implementation, and interpretation of results in this context. High-definition fiber tractography (HDFT) is one of several non-tensor tractography approaches permitting visualization of crossing white matter trajectories at high resolutions, dispensing with the well-known shortcomings of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. In this article, we provide an overview of the advantages of HDFT in a neurosurgical context, derived from our considerable experience implementing the technique for academic and clinical purposes. We highlight nuances of qualitative and quantitative approaches to using HDFT for brain tumor surgery planning, and integration of tractography with complementary operative adjuncts, and consider areas requiring further research.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) techniques are widely used for identifying the corticospinal tract (CST) white matter pathways as part of presurgical planning. However, mass effects in patients with brain tumors tend to cause anatomical distortions and compensatory functional reorganization of the cortex, which may lead to inaccurate mapping of white matter tracts. To overcome these problems, we compared different region-of-interest (ROI) selection schemes to track CST fibers in patients with brain tumors. Our study investigated the CSTs of 16 patients with intracranial tumors. The patients were classified into 3 subgroups according to the spatial relationships of the lesion and the primary motor cortex (PMC)/internal capsule. Specifically, we investigated the key factors that cause distorted tractography in patients with tumors. We compared 3 CST tractography methods that used different ROI selection schemes. The results indicate that CST fiber tracking methods based only on anatomical ROIs could possibly lead to distortions near the PMC region and may be unable to effectively localize the PMC. In contrast, the dual ROI method, which uses ROIs that have been selected from both blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) activation and anatomical landmarks, enabled the tracking of fibers to the motor cortex. The results demonstrate that the dual ROI method can localize the entire CST fiber pathway and can accurately describe the spatial relationships of CST fibers relative to the tumor. These results illustrate the reliability of using fMRI-guided DTT in patients with tumors. The combination of fMRI and anatomical information enhances the identification of tracts of interest in brains with anatomical deformations, which provides neurosurgeons with a more accurate approach for visualizing and localizing white matter fiber tracts in patients with brain tumors. This approach enhances surgical performance and perserves brain function.

N2  -  Multimodal imaging is one of the necessary steps in the treatment of malignant brain tumors, and use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the current gold standard technique for the morphological and biological assessment of malignant brain tumors. In addition, fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and C-11-methionine PET are useful to determine the tumor border at the tumor and white matter interface. Although there is no question of their value, a universally accepted cut-off value to discriminate normal and abnormal tissue has not been established. In this study we attempted to calculate and determine the cut-off values in FA and C-11-methionine PET that will allow delineation of the tumor border at the tumor and white matter interface by combining these two modalities. We were able to determine individual cut-off values for 11 patients, and then found an average cut-off value in the T/N ratio of 11C-methionine PET of 1.27 and in FA of 0.26, values similar to those previously confirmed by histological study. Moreover, reconstructing images delineating the tumor border was possible combining these two imaging modalities. We propose that the combined analysis of DTI and C-11-methionine PET has the potential to improve tumor border imaging in glioma patients, providing important information for establishing neurosurgical strategies.

N2  -  Understanding the long association pathways that convey cortical connections is a critical step in exploring the anatomic substrates of cognition in health and disease. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to demonstrate fibre tracts non-invasively, but present approaches have been hampered by the inability to visualize fibres that have intersecting trajectories (crossing fibres), and by the lack of a detailed map of the origins, course and terminations of the white matter pathways. We therefore used diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) that has the ability to resolve crossing fibres at the scale of single MRI voxels, and identified the long association tracts in the monkey brain. We then compared the results with available expositions of white matter pathways in the monkey using autoradiographic histological tract tracing. We identified 10 long association fibre bundles with DSI that match the observations in the isotope material: emanating from the parietal lobe, the superior longitudinal fasciculus subcomponents I, II and III; from the occipital-parietal region, the fronto-occipital fasciculus; from the temporal lobe, the middle longitudinal fasciculus and from rostral to caudal, the uncinate fasciculus, extreme capsule and arcuate fasciculus; from the occipital-temporal region, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus; and from the cingulate gyrus, the cingulum bundle. We suggest new interpretations of the putative functions of these fibre bundles based on the cortical areas that they link. These findings using DSI and validated with reference to autoradiographic tract tracing in the monkey represent a considerable advance in the understanding of the fibre pathways in the cerebral white matter. By replicating the major features of these tracts identified by histological techniques in monkey, we show that DSI has the potential to cast new light on the organization of the human brain in the normal state and in clinical disorders.

N2  -  Purpose: To apply fiber tractography to assess the effect of a possible antiglioma drug, phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), on glioma-affected neuronal fibers. The fiber tractography method was able to differentiate between different tumor types. such as the C6 and F98 rat glioma models.
Materials and Methods: C6 or F98 cells were intracranially injected into the cortex of male Fischer 344 rats. PBN treatment was initiated before or after cell implantation. Tumor growth was monitored with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography using diffusion-weighting gradients in 30 noncolinear directions. neuronal fiber tractography. we were able to evaluate the protective effect of PBN against invasive glioma growth in rat brains. PBN provided protection of the neuronal fibers against tumor-induced ischemia and tumor invasion.; Results: Although proton density-weighted (PDw) and T2-weighted (T2w) images did not show any difference between C6 and F98 gliomas without edema, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were able to discriminate between these two tumor models. Fiber tractography was used to) visualize C6 glioma-induced ischemia of tumor-surrounding tissues, whereas F98 glioma was found to infiltrate and penetrate into the corpus callosum (CC). During glioma growth, neuronal fibers were found to disappear at the border regions between the tumor and surrounding tissues. PBN treatment was shown to inhibit glioma growth with accompanying changes in the surrounding tissue.; Conclusion: By noninvasively monitoring the degree of neuronal fiber integrity and connectivity with the use of

N2  -  Among all causes of death in children from solid tumors, pediatric brain tumors are the most common. This article includes an overview of a subset of infratentorial and supratentorial tumors with a focus on tumor imaging features and molecular advances and treatments of these tumors. Key to understanding the imaging features of brain tumors is a firm grasp of other disease processes that can mimic tumor on imaging. We also review imaging features of a common subset of tumor mimics.

N2  -  Purpose: Intraoperative diffusion MRI could provide a means of visualising brain fibre tracts near a neurosurgical target after preoperative images have been invalidated by brain shift. We propose an atlas-based intraoperative tract segmentation method, as the standard preoperative method, streamline tractography, is unsuitable for intraoperative implementation. Methods: A tract-specific voxel-wise fibre orientation atlas is constructed from healthy training data. After registration with a target image, a radial tumour deformation model is applied to the orientation atlas to account for displacement caused by lesions. The final tract map is obtained from the inner product of the atlas and target image fibre orientation data derived from intraoperative diffusion MRI. Results: The simple tumour model takes only seconds to effectively deform the atlas into alignment with the target image. With minimal processing time and operator effort, maps of surgically relevant tracts can be achieved that are visually and qualitatively comparable with results obtained from streamline tractography. Conclusion: Preliminary results demonstrate feasibility of intraoperative streamline-free tract segmentation in challenging neurosurgical cases. Demonstrated results in a small number of representative sample subjects are realistic despite the simplicity of the tumour deformation model employed. Following this proof of concept, future studies will focus on achieving robustness in a wide range of tumour types and clinical scenarios, as well as quantitative validation of segmentations.

N2  -  Building a human connectome database has recently attracted the attention of many researchers, although its application to individual subjects has yet to be explored. In this study, we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging of 90 subjects and showed that this dataset can be used as a norm to examine pathways with deviant connectivity in individuals. This analytical approach, termed diffusion MRI connectometry, was realized by reconstructing patient data to a common stereotaxic space and calculating the percentile rank of the diffusion quantities with respect to those of the norm. The affected tracks were constructed with deterministic tractography using the local tract orientations with substantially low percentile ranks as seeds. To demonstrate the performance of the connectometry, we applied it to 7 patients with chronic stroke and compared the results with lesions shown on T-2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, as well as clinical manifestations. The results showed that the affected tracks revealed by the connectometry corresponded well with the stroke lesions shown on T-2-weighted images. Moreover, while the T-2-weighted images, as well as the ADC and FA maps, showed only the stroke lesions, connectometry revealed entire affected tracks, a feature that is potentially useful for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation. This unique capability may provide personalized information regarding the structural connectivity underlying brain development, plasticity, or disease in each individual subject.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been at the forefront of cancer imaging since the early 2000s. Before its application in clinical oncology, this powerful technique had already achieved widespread recognition due to its utility in the diagnosis of cerebral infarction. Following this initial success, the ability of DWI to detect inherent tissue contrast began to be exploited in the field of oncology. Although the initial oncologic applications for tumor detection and characterization, assessing treatment response, and predicting survival were primarily in the field of neurooncology, the scope of DWI has since broadened to include oncologic imaging of the prostate gland, breast, and liver. Despite its growing success and application, misconceptions about the underlying physical basis of the DWI signal exist among researchers and clinicians alike. In this review, we provide a detailed explanation of the biophysical basis of diffusion contrast, emphasizing the difference between hindered and restricted diffusion, and elucidating how diffusion parameters in tissue are derived from the measurements via the diffusion model. We describe one advanced DWI modeling technique, called restriction spectrum imaging (RSI). This technique offers a more direct in vivo measure of tumor cells, due to its ability to distinguish separable pools of water within tissue based on their intrinsic diffusion characteristics. Using RSI as an example, we then highlight the ability of advanced DWI techniques to address key clinical challenges in neurooncology, including improved tumor conspicuity, distinguishing actual response to therapy from pseudoresponse, and delineation of white matter tracts in regions of peritumoral edema. We also discuss how RSI, combined with new methods for correction of spatial distortions inherent in diffusion MRI scans, may enable more precise spatial targeting of lesions, with implications for radiation oncology and surgical planning.

N2  -  The research is to develop advanced high-field MRI technologies for the study of brain activation and functional connectivity. The specific aims of this research are: 1. Develop effective and reliable functional MRI techniques through mapping of sensory functions; 2. Develop rat model to correlate fMRI contrast with electrophysiological activity in the fore-brain; 3. Develop diffusion tensor MRI techniques to reconstruct cerebral white matter trajectories. We have successfully achieved the specific aims to develop effective and reliable functional MRI techniques for both human and animal studies; Correlative studies have been successfully done with multiple channel ensemble single-unit recording and fMRI activation pattern. As for the connectivity imaging, we have implemented and validated the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as well as diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) to reveal the fiber connectivity and cytostructure imaging of the brain activation. Applied these techniques, one can study the brain function with fMRI, diffusion spectrum brain connectivity/cytostructure imaging and simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiological activations recording in the same lab. This opens up a possible avenue for us to monitor the dynamic change of neuronal structure and connectivity caused by brain lesions or associated learning experiences.

N2  -  OBJECT Resection of brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs) may reduce the risk of stepwise neurological deterioration secondary to hemorrhage, but the morbidity of surgery remains high. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) are neuroimaging techniques that may assist in the complex surgical planning necessary for these lesions. The authors evaluate the utility of preoperative DTI and DTT in the surgical management of BSCMs and their correlation with functional outcome.
METHODS A retrospective review was conducted to identify patients who underwent resection of a BSCM between 2007 and 2012. All patients had preoperative DTIDTT studies and a minimum of 6 months of clinical and radiographic follow-up. Five major fiber tracts were evaluated preoperatively using the DTIDTT protocol: 1) corticospinal tract, 2) medial lemniscus and medial longitudinal fasciculus, 3) inferior cerebellar peduncle, 4) middle cerebellar peduncle, and 5) superior cerebellar peduncle. Scores were applied according to the degree of distortion seen, and the sum of scores was used for analysis. Functional outcomes were measured at hospital admission, discharge, and last clinic visit using modified Rankin Scale (mRS)scores.; RESULTS Eleven patients who underwent resection of a BSCM and preoperative DTI were identified. The mean age at presentation was 49 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.75:1. Cranial nerve deficit was the most common presenting symptom (81.8%), followed by cerebellar signs or gaitbalance difficulties (54.5%) and hemibody anesthesia (27.2%). The majority of the lesions were located within the pons (54.5%). The mean diameter and estimated volume of lesions were 1.21 cm and 1.93 cm(3), respectively. Using DTI and DTT, 9 patients (82%) were found to have involvement of 2 or more major fiber tracts; the corticospinal tract and medial lemniscusmedial longitudinal fasciculus were the most commonly affected. In 2 patients with BSCMs without pial presentation, DTIDTT findings were important in the selection of the surgical approach. In 2 other patients, the results from preoperative DTIDTT were important for selection of brainstem entry zones. All 11 patients underwent gross-total resection of their BSCMs. After a mean postoperative follow-up duration of 32.04 months, all 11 patients had excellent or good outcome (mRS Score 0-3) at the time of last outpatient clinic evaluation. DTI score did not correlate with long-term outcome.; CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI and DTT should be considered in the resection of symptomatic BSCMs. These. imaging studies may influence the selection of surgical approach or brainstem entry zones, especially in deep-seated lesions without pial or ependymal presentation. DTIDTT findings may allow for more aggressive management of lesions previously considered surgically inaccessible. Preoperative DTIDTT changes do not appear to correlate with functional postoperative outcome in long-term follow-up.

N2  -  The current dogma to explain the extent of injury-related changes following rodent controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury is a focal injury with limited axonal pathology. However, there is in fact good, published histologic evidence to suggest that axonal injury is far more widespread in this model than generally thought. One possibility that might help to explain this is the often-used region-of-interest data analysis approach taken by experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or histologic studies that might miss more widespread damage, when compared to the whole brain, statistically robust method of tract-based analysis used more routinely in clinical research. To determine the extent of DTI changes in this model, we acquired in vivo DTI data before and at 1 and 4 weeks after CCI injury in 17 adult male rats and analyzed parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial, radial, and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, MD), tensor mode (MO), and fiber tract density (FTD) using tract-based spatial statistics. Contusion volume was used as a surrogate marker of injury severity and as a covariate for investigating severity dependence of the data. Mean fiber tract length was also computed from seeds in the cortical spinal tract regions. In parallel experiments (n = 3-5/group), we investigated corpus callosum neurofilaments and demyelination using immunohistochemistry (IHC) at 3 days and 6 weeks, callosal tract patency using dual-label retrograde tract tracing at 5 weeks, and the contribution of gliosis to DTI parameter maps using GFAP IHC at 4 weeks post-injury. The data show widespread ipsilateral regions of significantly reduced FA at 1 week post-injury, driven by temporally changing values of AD, RD, and MD that persist to 4 weeks. Demyelination, retrograde label tract loss, and reductions in MO (tract degeneration) and FTD were shown to underpin these data. Significant FA increases occurred in subcortical and corticospinal tract regions that were spatially distinct from regions of FA decrease, grossly affected gliotic areas, and MO changes. However, there was good spatial correspondence between regions of increased FA and areas of increased FTD and mean fiber length. We discuss these widespread changes in DTI parameters in terms of axonal degeneration and potential reorganization, with reference to a resting state fMRI companion paper (Harris et al., 2016, Exp. Neurol. 227: 124-138) that demonstrated altered functional connectivity data acquired from the same rats used in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) based on nTMS data are increasingly used for preoperative planning and resection guidance in patients suffering from motor-eloquent brain tumors. The present study explores whether nTMS-based DTI FT can also be used for individual preoperative risk assessment regarding surgery-related motor impairment.
METHODS Data derived from preoperative nTMS motor mapping and subsequent nTMS-based tractography in 86 patients were analyzed. All patients suffered from high-grade glioma (HGG), low-grade glioma (LGG), or intracranial metastasis (MET). In this context, nTMS-based DTI FT of the corticospinal tract (CST) was performed at a range of fractional anisotropy (FA) levels based on an individualized FA threshold (FAT; tracking with 50%, 75%, and 100% FAT), which was defined as the highest FA value allowing for visualization of fibers (100% FAT). Minimum lesion-to-CST distances were measured, and fiber numbers of the reconstructed CST were assessed. These data were then correlated with the preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up status of motor function and the resting motor threshold (rMT).; RESULTS At certain FA levels, a statistically significant difference in lesion-to-CST distances was observed between patients with HGG who had no impairment and those who developed surgery-related transient or permanent motor deficits (75% FAT: p = 0.0149; 100% FAT: p = 0.0233). In this context, no patient with a lesion-to-CST distance = 12 mm suffered from any new surgery-related permanent paresis (50% FAT and 75% FAT). Furthermore, comparatively strong negative correlations were observed between the rMT and lesion-to-CST distances of patients with surgery-related transient paresis (Spearman correlation coefficient r(s); 50% FAT: r(s) = -0.8660; 75% FAT: r(s) = -0.8660) or surgery-related permanent paresis (50% FAT: r(s) = -0.7656; 75% FAT: r(s) = -0.6763).; CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first studies to show a direct correlation between imaging, clinical status, and neurophysiological markers for the integrity of the motor system in patients with brain tumors. The findings suggest that nTMSbased DTI FT might be suitable for individual risk assessment in patients with HGG, in addition to being a surgery-planning tool. Importantly, necessary data for risk assessment were obtained without significant additional efforts, making this approach potentially valuable for direct clinical use.

N2  -  The concept of diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging emerged in the mid-1980s, together with the first images of water diffusion in the human brain, as a way to probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale, although the images were acquired at a millimetric scale. Since then, diffusion MR imaging has become a pillar of modern clinical imaging. Diffusion MR imaging has mainly been used to investigate neurologic disorders. A dramatic application of diffusion MR imaging has been acute brain ischemia, providing patients with the opportunity to receive suitable treatment at a stage when brain tissue might still be salvageable, thus avoiding terrible handicaps. On the other hand, it was found that water diffusion is anisotropic in white matter, because axon membranes limit molecular movement perpendicularly to the nerve fibers. This feature can be exploited to produce stunning maps of the orientation in space of the white matter tracts and brain connections in just a few minutes. Diffusion MR imaging is now also rapidly expanding in oncology, for the detection of malignant lesions and metastases, as well as monitoring. Water diffusion is usually largely decreased in malignant tissues, and body diffusion MR imaging, which does not require any tracer injection, is rapidly becoming a modality of choice to detect, characterize, or even stage malignant lesions, especially for breast or prostate cancer. After a brief summary of the key methodological concepts beyond diffusion MR imaging, this article will give a review of the clinical literature, mainly focusing on current outstanding issues, followed by some innovative proposals for future improvements.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Total tumor excision with the preservation of neurological function and quality of life is the goal of modernday vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery. Postoperative facial nerve (FN) paralysis is a devastating complication of VS surgery. Determining the course of the FN in relation to a VS preoperatively is invaluable to the neurosurgeon and is likely to enhance surgical safety with respect to FN function. Diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking (DTI-FT) technology is slowly gaining traction as a viable tool for preoperative FN visualization in patients with VS.
METHODS A systematic review of the literature in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and those studies that preoperatively localized the FN in relation to a VS using the DTI-FT technique and verified those preoperative FN tracking results by using microscopic observation and electrophysiological monitoring during microsurgery were included. A pooled analysis of studies was performed to calculate the surgical concordance rate (accuracy) of DTI-FT technology for FN localization.; RESULTS Fourteen studies included 234 VS patients (malefemale ratio 1:1.4, age range 17-75 years) who had undergone preoperative DTI-FT for FN identification. The mean tumor size among the studies ranged from 29 to 41.3 mm. Preoperative DTI-FT could not visualize the FN tract in 8 patients (3.4%) and its findings could not be verified in 3 patients (1.2%), were verified but discordant in 18 patients (7.6%), and were verified and concordant in 205 patients (87.1%).; CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI-FT for FN identification is a useful adjunct in the surgical planning for large VSs (> 2.5 cm). A pooled analysis showed that DTI-FT successfully identifies the complete FN course in 96.6% of VSs (226 of 234 cases) and that FN identification by DTI-FT is accurate in 90.6% of cases (205 of 226 cases). Larger studies with DTI-FT-integrated neuronavigation are required to look at the direct benefit offered by this specific technique in preserving postoperative FN function.

N2  -  Background: Characterization of WM alteration using MR imaging is important in the pre- and intraoperative assessment of brain tumors. This study characterizes the extent and severity of WM tract alterations near brain tumors using DTI in an effort to determine preoperative viability or resectability of the adjacent WM tracts. Fractional anisotropy is an important DTI-derived metric of MR imaging.
Methods: Twenty-one patients underwent MR DTI. Eighty-six WM tracts composed of 43 WM lesions paired with 43 contralateral WM hemispheric controls were categorized using FA. Neuroradiologists categorized the WM tracts as edematous, displaced, disrupted, or infiltrated with tumor using directionally encoded color maps. A mixed model analysis was used to compare FA.; Results: Of the lesioned tracts, 5 were scored as edema, 9 as infiltration, 18 as displacement, and 11 as disruption. A significant Delta FA% was found between the lesioned and contralateral hemispheres only in WM disruption (P=.0056). Both edema FA and disruption FA are significantly less than displacement FA (P<.05). The FA change (Delta FA% = FA(lesion) - FA(normal)FA(normal) x 100%) on the lesioned side was calculated. A Delta FA% less than -30% is likely to be associated with WM disruption. A positive Delta FA% is likely to be associated with edema or displacement, and a Delta FA% between 0% and -30% is likely to be associated with WM displacement or infiltration.; Conclusions: Quantitative analysis of DTI data may provide insight as to whether WM tracts are salvageable preoperatively.

N2  -  Introduction The goal of brain tumor surgery is the maximal resection of neoplastic tissue, while preserving the adjacent functional brain tissues. The identification of functional networks involved in complex brain functions, including visuospatial abilities (VSAs), is usually difficult. We report our preliminary experience using a preoperative planning based on the combination of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and DTI tractography to provide the preoperative 3D reconstruction of the visuospatial (VS) cortico-subcortical network in patients with right parietal lobe tumors. Material and Methods Patients affected by right parietal lobe tumors underwent mapping of both hemispheres using an nTMS-implemented version of the Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT) to identify cortical areas involved in the VS network. DTI tractography was used to compute the subcortical component of the network, consisting of the three branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The 3D reconstruction of the VS network was used to plan and guide the safest surgical approach to resect the tumor and avoid damage to the network. We retrospectively analyzed the cortical distribution of nTMS-induced errors, and assessed the impact of the planning on surgery by analyzing the extent of tumor resection (EOR) and the occurrence of postoperative VSAs deficits in comparison with a matched historical control group of patients operated without using the nTMS-based preoperative reconstruction of the VS network. Results Twenty patients were enrolled in the study (Group A). The error rate (ER) induced by nTMS was higher in the right vs. the left hemisphere (p=0.02). In the right hemisphere, the ER was higher in the anterior supramarginal gyrus (aSMG) (1.7%), angular gyrus (1.4%) superior parietal lobule (SPL) (1.3%), and dorsal lateral occipital gyrus (dLoG) (1.2%). The reconstruction of the cortico-subcortical VS network was successfully used to plan and guide tumor resection. A gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 85% of cases. After surgery no new VSAs deficits were observed and a slightly significant improvement of the HVOT score (p=0.02) was documented. The historical control group (Group B) included 20 patients matched for main clinical characteristics with patients in Group A, operated without the support of the nTMS-based planning. A GTR was achieved in 90% of cases, but the postoperative HVOT score resulted to be worsened as compared to the preoperative period (p=0.03). The comparison between groups showed a significantly improved postoperative HVOT score in Group A vs. Group B (p=0.03). Conclusions The nTMS-implemented HVOT is a feasible approach to map cortical areas involved in VSAs. It can be combined with DTI tractography, thus providing a reconstruction of the VS network that could guide neurosurgeons to preserve the VS network during tumor resection, thus reducing the occurrence of postoperative VSAs deficits as compared to standard asleep surgery.

N2  -  The ability to visualize the brain's fiber connections noninvasively in vivo is relatively young compared with other possibilities of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although many studies showed tractography to be of promising value for neurosurgical care, the implications remain inconclusive. An overview of current applications is presented in this systematic review. A search was conducted for (("tractography" or "fiber tracking" or "fibre tracking") and "neurosurgery") that produced 751 results. We identified 260 relevant articles and added 20 more from other sources. Most publications concerned surgical planning for resection of tumors (n = 193) and vascular lesions (n = 15). Preoperative use of transcranial magnetic stimulation was discussed in 22 of these articles. Tractography in skull base surgery presents a special challenge (n = 29). Fewer publications evaluated traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 25) and spontaneous intracranial bleeding (n = 22). Twenty-three articles focused on tractography in pediatric neurosurgery. Most authors found tractography to be a valuable addition in neurosurgical care. The accuracy of the technique has increased over time. There are articles suggesting that tractography improves patient outcome after tumor resection. However, no reliable biomarkers have yet been described. The better rehabilitation potential after TBI and spontaneous intracranial bleeding compared with brain tumors offers an insight into the process of neurorehabilitation. Tractography and diffusion measurements in some studies showed a correlation with patient outcome that might help uncover the neuroanatomical principles of rehabilitation itself. Alternative corticofugal and cortico-cortical networks have been implicated in motor recovery after ischemic stroke, suggesting more complex mechanisms in neurorehabilitation that go beyond current models. Hence tractography may potentially be able to predict clinical deficits and rehabilitation potential, as well as finding possible explanations for neurologic disorders in retrospect. However, large variations of the results indicate a lack of data to establish robust diagnostical concepts at this point. Therefore, in vivo tractography should still be interpreted with caution and by experienced surgeons.

N2  -  Object: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used preoperatively in patients with eloquent-located brain lesions and allows analyzing non-invasively the spatial relationship between the tumor and functional areas (e.g. the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract [CST]). In this study, we examined the diffusion parameters FA (fractional anisotropy) and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) within the CST in different locations and analyzed their interrater reliability and usefulness for predicting the patients' motor outcome with a precise approach of specific region of interest (ROI) seeding based on the color-coded FA-map.
Methods: Prospectively collected data of 30 patients undergoing bihemispheric nTMS mapping followed by nTMS-based DTI fiber tracking prior to surgery of motor eloquent high-grade gliomas were analyzed by 2 experienced and 1 unexperienced examiner. The following data were scrutinized for both hemispheres after tractography based on nTMS-motor positive cortical seeds and a 2nd region of interest in one layer of the caudal pons defined by the color-coded FA-map: the pre-and postoperative motor status (day of discharge und 3 months), the closest distance between the tracts and the tumor (TTD), the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The latter as an average within the CST as well as specific values in different locations (peritumoral, mesencephal, pontine).; Results: Lower average FA-values within the affected CST as well as higher average ADC-values are significantly associated with deteriorated postoperative motor function (p = 0.006 and p = 0.026 respectively). Segmental analysis within the CST revealed that the diffusion parameters are especially disturbed on a peritumoral level and that the degree of their impairment correlates with motor deficits (FA p = 0.065, ADC p = 0.007). No significant segmental variation was seen in the healthy hemisphere. The interrater reliability showed perfect agreement for almost all analyzed parameters.; Conclusions: Adding diffusion weighted imaging derived information on the structural integrity of the nTMS-based tractography results improves the predictive power for postoperative motor outcome. Utilizing a second subcortical ROI which is specifically seeded based on the color-coded FA map increases the tracking quality of the CST independently of the examiner's experience. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the nTMS-based prediction of the patient's outcome.

N2  -  Background: Management of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) close to motor areas is challenging due to the risk of treatment-related morbidity. Thus, for resection, functional mapping of the corticospinal tract (CST) with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber tracking (DTI-FTTMS) is increasingly used. This study investigated the application of DTIFTTMS in adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) planning of HGGs for CST avoidance.Methods: The preoperative DTI-FTTMS-based CST reconstructions of 35 patients harboring HGGs were incorporated into the RT planning system and merged with planning imaging. The CST was delineated as the planning risk volume (PRV-FTTMS). Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) plans were optimized to preserve PRV-FTTMS. Segments within the planning target volume (PTV) were not spared (overlap).Results: With plan optimization, mean dose (Dmean) of PRV-FTTMS can be reduced by 17.1% on average (range 0.1-37.9%), thus from 25.5 Gy to 21.2 Gy (p < 0.001). For PRV-FTTMS segments beyond the PTV dose, reduction is possible by 26.8% (range 0.1-43.9%, Dmean 17.4 Gy vs. 12.5 Gy, p < 0.001). Considering only portions within the 50% isodose level, Dmean is decreased by 46.7% from 38.6 Gy to 20.5 Gy (range 19.1-62.8%, p < 0.001). PTV coverage was not affected: V95% and V90% were 96.4 +/- 3.1% and 98.0 +/- 3.9% vs. 96.1 +/- 3.5% (p = 0.34) and 98.3 +/- 2.9% (p = 0.58). Dose constraints for organs at risk (OARs) were all met.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that DTI-FTTMS can be utilized in the RT planning of HGGs for CST sparing. However, the degree of dose reduction depends on the overlap with the PTV. The functional benefit needs to be investigated in future prospective clinical trials.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  The detection of brain tumors using standard techniques of qualitative, relaxation-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires the application of contrast agents. We investigated whether or not it is possible to use diffusion-weighted MRI to localize tumors without contrast enhancement. Three different experimental rat brain tumors were studied: F98 glioma, RN6 Schwannoma and E376 neuroblastoma.
We found a marked hypointensity in the region of the tumor and edema in heavily diffusion-weighted images, which corresponded well with the histological presentation. Quantitative maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) allowed a better localization of the tumor than that obtained by regional presentation of T2 times, particularly under conditions in which peritumoral edema was absent. The ADC differences of the three tumor types were statistically not significant. Based upon regions-of-interest evaluations, tumor could be distinguished from peritumoral edema and normal brain tissue. However, a sharp demarcation between tumor and peritumoral edema was not possible, and this is attributed to a similar enlargement of interstitial space.; It was concluded that diffusion-weighted MRI possesses a high potential for the detection of brain tumors but does not allow precise demarcation of the tumor border.

N2  -  Background: Tractography has become a standard technique for planning neurosurgical operations in the past decades. This technique relies on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The cutoff value for the fractional anisotropy (FA) has an important role in avoiding false-positive and false-negative results. However, there is a wide variation in FA cutoff values. Methods: We analyzed a prospective cohort of 14 patients (six males and eight females, 50.1 +/- 4.0 years old) with intracerebral tumors that were mostly gliomas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained within 7 days before and within 7 days after surgery with T1 and diffusion tensor image (DTI) sequences. We, then, reconstructed the corticospinal tract (CST) in all patients and extracted the FA values within the resulting volume. Results: The mean FA in all CSTs was 0.4406 +/- 0.0003 with the fifth percentile at 0.1454. FA values in right-hemispheric CSTs were lower (p < 0.0001). Postoperatively, the FA values were more condensed around their mean (p < 0.0001). The analysis of infiltrated or compressed CSTs revealed a lower fifth percentile (0.1407 +/- 0.0109 versus 0.1763 +/- 0.0040, p = 0.0036). Conclusion: An FA cutoff value of 0.15 appears to be reasonable for neurosurgical patients and may shorten the tractography workflow. However, infiltrated fiber bundles must trigger vigilance and may require lower cutoffs.

N2  -  Background: The role of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) has become increasingly important in the preoperative mapping of brain white matter. Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) driven DTT has provided the ability to evaluate the spatial relationship between the corticospinal tract (CST) and motor resection tumor boundaries. The main objective of this study was improvement of the preoperative assessment of the CST in patients with gliomas involving the motor cortical areas. Methods: Seventeen patients with gliomas involving motor cortical areas underwent 3 dimensions (3D) T1-weighted imaging for anatomical referencing, using both fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We used the fast-marching tractography (FMT) algorithm to define the 3D connectivity maps within the whole brain using seed points selected in the white matter adjacent to the location of fMRI activation. The target region of interest (ROI) was placed in the cerebral peduncle. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores were evaluated for each patient before and after surgery. Results: The CST of a total seventeen patients were successfully tracked by choosing seed and target ROI on the path of the fibers. What is more, DTT can indicate preoperatively the possibility for total glioma removal or the maximum extent of surgical resection. The postoperative average KPS score for the seventeen patients enrolled increased by more than 10 points. Conclusions: Incorporation of fMRI driven DTT showed a maximum benefit in surgical treatment of gliomas. Our study of the assessment precision should enhance the accuracy of glioma operations with a resulting improvement in postoperative patient outcome.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to define the topographical distribution of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) damage in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), using a multiparametric MR-based approach. Using a 3 Tesla scanner, dual-echo, 3D fast-field echo (FFE), and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI scans were acquired from 18 PPMS patients and 17 matched healthy volunteers. An optimized voxel-based (VB) analysis was used to investigate the patterns of regional GM density changes and to quantify GM and WM diffusivity alterations of the entire brain. In PPMS patients, GM atrophy was found in the thalami and the right insula, while mean diffusivity (MID) changes involved several cortical-subcortical structures in all cerebral lobes and the cerebellum. An overlap between decreased WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased WM MD was found in the corpus callosum, the cingulate gyrus, the left short temporal fibers, the right short frontal fibers, the optic radiations, and the middle cerebellar peduncles. Selective MD increase, not associated with FA decrease, was found in the internal capsules, the corticospinal tracts, the Superior longitudinal fasciculi, the fronto-occipital fasciculi, and the right cerebral peduncle. A discrepancy was found between regional WM diffusivity changes and focal lesions because several areas had DT MRI abnormalities but did not harbor T2-visible lesions. Our Study allowed to detect tissue damage in brain areas associated with motor and cognitive functions, which are known to be impaired in PPMS patients. Combining regional measures derived from different MR modalities may be a valuable tool to improve our understanding of PPMS pathophysiology. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3009-3019, 2009.

N2  -  Giant cerebral cavernous malformations (GCM) are rare vascular anomalies. They occur predominantly as solitary lesions in the supratentorial compartment. They are usually not associated with any other vascular malformations. Clinical Presentation GCM are common in the second decade, affecting females predominantly, and occur without familial association. They are all symptomatic due to their giant size and location. The GCM mimic neoplastic lesions because of their size and need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. A complete surgical extirpation is the treatment of choice. Use of intraoperative neuronavigation, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of fiber tracts and electrophysiological monitoring assist in safe and total excision of the lesions. A complete surgical excision of GCM is possible without significant surgical morbidity and results in long term cure.

N2  -  Although surgery is not curative for the majority of intracranial gliomas, radical resection has been demonstrated to influence survival and delay tumor progression. Because gliomas are very frequently located in eloquent or more generally critical areas, surgeons must always balance the maximizing resection with the need to preserve neurological function. In this overview, we tried to summarize the recent literature and our personal experience about (1) the benefits and limits of using preoperative anatomical and functional neuroimaging (anatomical MRI, DTI fiber tracking, and functional MRI), (2) the issues to consider in planning the surgical strategy, (3) the need to thoroughly understand microsurgical techniques that enable a maximal resection (subpial dissection, vascular manipulation, etc.), (4) the importance of individualizing surgical strategy especially in patients with gliomas in eloquent areas (the role of neuropsychological evaluation in redefining eloquent and non-eloquent areas), and (5) how to use intraoperative mapping techniques and understand why and when to use them. Through this paper, the reader should become more familiar with a comprehensive panel of techniques and methodologies but more importantly become aware that these recent technical advances facilitate a conceptual change from classical surgical paradigms toward a more patient-specific approach.

N2  -  Introduction Preserving the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) while maximizing the extent of tumor resection is one of the key principles of brain tumor surgery to prevent new neurologic deficits. Our goal was to determine the impact of the use of perioperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber-tracking protocols for location of the CSTs, in conjunction with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) on patient neurologic outcomes. The role of combining DES and CST shift in intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) to enhance extent of resection (EOR) has not been studied previously.
Methods A total of 53 patients underwent resection of tumors adjacent to the motor gyrus and the underlying CST between June 5, 2009, and April 16, 2013. All cases were performed in the iMRI (BrainSuite 1.5 T). Preoperative DTI mapping and intraoperative cortical and subcortical DES including postoperative DTI mapping were performed in all patients. There were 32 men and 21 women with 40 high-grade gliomas (76%), 4 low-grade gliomas (8%), and 9 (17%) metastases. Thirty-four patients (64%) were newly diagnosed, and 19 (36%) had a previous resection. There were 31 (59%) right-sided and 22 (42%) left-sided tumors. Eighteen patients (34%) had a re-resection after the first intraoperative scan. Most patients had motor-only mapping, and one patient had both speech and motor mapping. Relative to the resection margin, the CST after the first iMRI was designated as having an outward shift (OS), inward shift (IS), or no shift (NS).; Results A gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 41 patients (77%), subtotal resection in 4 (7.5%), and a partial resection in 8 (15%). Eighteen patients had a re-resection, and the mean EOR increased from 84% to 95% ( p =0.002). Of the 18 patients, 7 had an IS, 8 an OS, and in 3 NS was noted. More patients in the OS group had a GTR compared with the IS or NS groups ( p =0.004). Patients were divided into four groups based on the proximity of the tumor to the CST as measured from the preoperative scan. Group 1 (32%) included patients whose tumors were 0 to 5mm from the CST based on preoperative scans; group 2 (28%), 6 to 10mm; group 3 (13%), 11 to 15mm; and group 4 (26%), 16 to 20mm, respectively. Patients in group 4 had fewer neurologic complications compared with other groups at 1 and 3 months postoperatively ( p =0.001 and p =0.007, respectively) despite achieving a similar degree of resection ( p =0.61). Furthermore, the current of intraoperative DES was correlated to the distance of the tumor to the CST, and the regression equation showed a close linear relationship between the two parameters.; Conclusions Combining information about intraoperative CST and DES in the iMRI can enhance resection in brain tumors (77% had a GTR). The relative relationship between the positions of the CST to the resection cavity can be a dynamic process that could further influence the surgeon's decision about the stimulation parameters and EOR. Also, the patients with an OS of the CST relative to the resection cavity had a GTR comparable with the other groups.

N2  -  Background: Although diffusion tensor imaging has been successfully applied in brain research for decades, several main difficulties have hindered its extended utilization in spinal cord imaging.
Purpose: To assess the feasibility and clinical value of diffusion tensor imaging and tractography for evaluating chronic spinal cord compression.; Material and Methods: Single-shot spin-echo echo-planar DT sequences were scanned in 42 spinal cord compression patients and 49 healthy volunteers. The mean values of the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy were measured in region of interest at the cervical and lower thoracic spinal cord. The patients were divided into two groups according to the high signal on T2WI (the SCC-HI group and the SCC-nHI group for with or without high signal). A one-way ANOVA was used. Diffusion tensor tractography was used to visualize the morphological features of normal and impaired white matter.; Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy values between the different spinal cord segments of the normal subjects. All of the patients in the SCC-Hl group had increased apparent diffusion coefficient values and decreased fractional anisotropy values at the lesion level compared to the normal controls. However, there were no statistically significant diffusion index differences between the SCC-nHI group and the normal controls. In the diffusion tensor imaging maps, the normal spinal cord sections were depicted as fiber tracts that were color-encoded to a cephalocaudal orientation. The diffusion tensor images were compressed to different degrees in all of the patients.; Conclusion: Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography are promising methods for visualizing spinal cord tracts and can provide additional information in clinical studies in spinal cord compresion.

N2  -  The concept of a topographical map of the corpus callosum (CC) has emerged from lesion studies in humans and from anatomical tracing investigations in other mammals. We conducted the first in vivo study aimed at outlining the topographical organization of the normal human CC, using non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We tested cortical and callosal activation by the BOLD effect during simple sensory stimulation (tactile, gustatory and visual) and simple motor tasks in 38 volunteers. The axonal organization of callosal white matter was also studied in 16138 subjects, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). Activation foci evoked by taste stimuli were detected in most subjects in the anterior part of the CC, those elicited by motor tasks lay in the central portion of the body of the CC, and those elicited by tactile stimulation of different body regions lay in the posterior part of the body Activation foci evoked by visual stimulation were seen in the splenium of the CC. Callosal fibers interconnecting the primary cortical areas activated by taste stimulation, motor tasks, and tactile and visual stimuli were shown by DTT. Anatomical correlates of the BOLD activation foci were demonstrated in the CC, with fibers crossing it at the level of the genu, anterior and posterior body, and splenium, respectively This study demonstrates for the first time that the functional topographical organization of the human CC can be explored by fMRI in vivo. Our,findings may have clinical implications, especially for neurosurgical planning.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TDLs may be indistinguishable from high-grade gliomas on conventional MR imaging. The role of DTI in differentiating TDLs from high-grade gliomas is not clear, and quantitative comparison between the 2 has not been reported. Here we aimed to differentiate TDLs from high-grade gliomas by using DTI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 8 TDLs and 13 high-grade gliomas. The presence of 3 findings (ie, intralesional hyperintensities on the FA map, restricted diffusion in the lesion periphery, and a perilesional hyperintense FA rim) was assessed by visual inspection. The FA and MD values were measured in the central nonenhancing portion, peripheral enhancing portion, and perilesional edema for each lesion and compared between the 2 groups respectively.; RESULTS: TDLs had a significantly higher incidence of intralesional hyperintensities on FA maps (P = .049) but a lower incidence of a perilesional hyperintense FA rim (P < .001), compared with those of high-grade gliomas on visual inspection. TDLs had significantly higher FA (P = .004) and lower MD (P = .001) values in the peripheral enhancing portions of the lesions compared with those of high-grade gliomas. In perilesional edema, FA values were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas (P = .001).; CONCLUSIONS: DTI is helpful in differentiating TDLs from high-grade gliomas by using visual inspection and quantitative analysis.

N2  -  This study investigates water diffusion changes in Wallerian degeneration. We measured indices derived from the diffusion tensor (DT) and TB-weighted signal intensities in the descending motor pathways of patients with small chronic lacunar infarcts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule on one side. We compared these measurements in the healthy and lesioned sides at different levels in the brainstem caudal to the primary lesion. We found that secondary white matter degeneration is revealed by a large reduction in diffusion anisotropy only in regions where fibers are arranged in isolated bundles of parallel fibers, such as in the cerebral peduncle. In regions where the degenerated pathway crosses other tracts, such as in the rostral pens, paradoxically there is almost no change in diffusion anisotropy, but a significant change in the measured orientation of fibers. The trace of the diffusion tensor is moderately increased in all affected regions. This allows one to differentiate secondary and primary fiber loss where the increase in trace is considerably higher. We show that DT-MRI is more sensitive than TS-weighted MRI in detecting Wallerian degeneration. Significant diffusion abnormalities are observed over the entire trajectory of the affected pathway in each patient. This finding suggests that mapping degenerated pathways noninvasively with DT-MRI is feasible. However, the interpretation of water diffusion data is complex and requires a priori information about anatomy and architecture of the pathway under investigation. In particular, our study shows that in regions where fibers cross, existing DT-MRI-based fiber tractography algorithms may lead to erroneous conclusion about brain connectivity.

N2  -  Developments in MRI have made it possible to use diffusion-weighted MRI, perfusion MRI and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) to study lesions in the brain. We evaluated whether these techniques provide useful, complementary information for grading gliomas, in comparison with conventional MRI. We studied 17 patients with histologically verified gliomas, adding multivoxel proton MRS, echoplanar diffusion and perfusion MRI the a routine MRI examination. The maximum relative cerebral blood volume (CBV), minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and metabolic peak area ratios in proton MRS were calculated in solid parts of tumours on the same slice from each imaging data set. The mean minimum ADC of the 13 high-grade gliomas (0.92 +/- 0.27x10(-3) mm(2)/s) was lower than that of the four low-grade gliomas (1.28 +/- 0.15x10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P < 0.05). Means of maximum choline (Cho)/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Cho/creatine (Cr), Cho/Cr in normal brain (Cr-n) and minimum NAA/Cr ratios were 5.90 +/- 2.62, 4.73 +/- 2.22, 2.66 +/- 0.68 and 0.40 +/- 0.06, respectively, in the high-grade gliomas, and 1.65 +/- 1.37, 1.84 +/- 1.20, 1.61 +/- 1.29 and 1.65 +/- 11.61, respectively, in the low-grade gliomas. Significant differences were found on spectroscopy between the high- and low-grade gliomas (P < 0.05). Mean maximum relative CBV in the high-grade,gliomas (6.10 +/- 3.98) was higher than in the low-grade gliomas (1.74 +/- 0.57) (P < 0.05). Echoplanar diffusion, perfusion MRI and multivoxel proton MRS can offer diagnostic information, not available with conventional MRI, in the assessment of glioma grade.

N2  -  Purpose: To maximize the extent of tumor resection and minimize postoperative neurological deficits in patients with brain neoplasms, it is very important to evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) before surgery. We attempted to determine whether CST abnormality in these patients correlates with clinical motor weakness.
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 19 patients (16 men, 3 women, aged 39 to 70 years) with pathologically proven brain neoplasms with lesions adjacent to the posterior limb of the internal capsule and categorized their motor function as normal or abnormal based on clinical assessment. After correcting raw diffusion tensor image (DTI) data for motion and eddy-current artifacts, we computed fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. We manually segmented the CST from the level of the cerebral peduncle to the internal capsule, used the segmented CST as the mask for FA and ADC measurements, and compared normalized FA (nFA) and ADC (nADC) values relative to the contralateral normal side using a 2-tailed, unpaired t-test.; Results: Compared with the normalized values for patients with normal motor function, patients with abnormal motor function demonstrated significantly decreased FA (P < 0.001, 0.65 +- 0.09 versus 0.85 +- 0.08) and significantly increased ADC (P < 0.01, 1.49 +- 0.17 versus 1.23 +- 0.22).; Conclusion: DTI metrics can be used for preoperative evaluation of the integrity of the CST microstructure.

N2  -  Preoperative mapping has revolutionized neurosurgical care for brain tumor patients. Maximizing resections has improved diagnosis, optimized treatment algorithms, and decreased potentially devastating postoperative deficits. Although mapping has multiple steps and complimentary localization sources, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) excels in its essential role in depicting white matter tracts. A thorough understanding of DTI, data visualization methods, and limitations with mastery of functional and dysfunctional white matter anatomy is necessary to realize the potential of DTI. By establishing spatial relationships between lesion borders and functional networks preoperatively and intraoperatively, DTI is central to high-risk neurosurgical resections and becoming the standard of care.

N2  -  Background An increasing number of neurosurgeons use display of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) based on diffusion weighted imaging (dMRI) as basis for their routine planning of stimulation or lesioning approaches in stereotactic tremor surgery. An evaluation of the anatomical validity of the display of the DRT with respect to modern stereotactic planning systems and across different tracking environments has not been performed.
Methods Distinct dMRI and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of high and low quality from 9 subjects were used. Six subjects had repeated MRI scans and therefore entered the analysis twice. Standardized DICOM structure templates for volume of interest definition were applied in native space for all investigations. For tracking BrainLab Elements (BrainLab, Munich, Germany), two tensor deterministic tracking (FT2), MRtrix IFOD2 (https:www.mrtrix.org), and a global tracking (GT) approach were used to compare the display of the uncrossed (DRTu) and crossed (DRTx) fiber structure after transformation into MNI space. The resulting streamlines were investigated for congruence, reproducibility, anatomical validity, and penetration of anatomical way point structures.; Results In general, the DRTu can be depicted with good quality (as judged by waypoints). FT2 (surgical) and GT (neuro-scientific) show high congruence. While GT shows partly reproducible results for DRTx, the crossed pathway cannot be reliably reconstructed with the other (iFOD2 and FT2) algorithms.; Conclusion Since a direct anatomical comparison is difficult in the individual subjects, we chose a comparison with two research tracking environments as the best possible "ground truth." FT2 is useful especially because of its manual editing possibilities of cutting erroneous fibers on the single subject level. An uncertainty of 2 mm as mean displacement of DRTu is expectable and should be respected when using this approach for surgical planning. Tractographic renditions of the DRTx on the single subject level seem to be still illusive.

N2  -  Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion MRI, and perfusion MRI, allow for a diverse range of multidimensional information regarding brain tumor physiology to be obtained in addition to the traditional anatomic images. Although it is well documented that MRI of rodent brain tumor models plays an important role in the basic research and drug discovery process of new brain tumor therapies, the role that animal models have played in translating these methodologies is rarely discussed in such articles. Even in consensus reports outlining the pathway to validation of these techniques, the use of animal models is given scant regard. This is despite that the use of rodent cancer models to test advanced MRI techniques predates and was integral to the development of clinical MRI. This article highlights just how integral preclinical imaging is to the discovery, development, and validation of advanced MRI techniques for imaging brain neoplasms.

N2  -  Objective: To ascertain whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics including tensor shape measures such as planar and spherical isotropy coefficients (CP and CS) can be used to distinguish high-grade from low-grade gliomas.
Methods: Twenty-five patients with histologically proved brain gliomas (10 low-grade and 15 high-grade) were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted images, non-diffusion weighted b = (b0) images, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), CS and CP maps were co-registered and each lesion was divided into two regions of interest (ROI): enhancing and immediate peritumoral edema (edema adjacent to tumor). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the best classification model.; Results: There was a statistically significant difference in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The best logistic regression model for classification combined three parameters (CS, FA and CP) from the immediate peritumoral part (p =0.02), resulting in 86% sensitivity, 80% specificity and area under the curve of 0.81.; Conclusion: Our study revealed that combined DTI metrics can function in effect as a non-invasive measure to distinguish between low-grade and high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Background: Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures such as T2 lesion load correlate poorly with disability in multiple sclerosis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain can provide unique information regarding the orientation and integrity of white matter tracts in vivo.
Objective: To use this information to map the pyramidal tracts of patients with multiple sclerosis, investigate the relation between burden of disease in the tracts and disability, and compare this with more global magnetic resonance estimates of disease burden.; Methods: 25 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy volunteers were studied with DTI. An algorithm was used that automatically produced anatomically plausible maps of white matter tracts. The integrity of the pyramidal tracts was assessed using relative anisotropy and a novel measure (L) derived from the compounded relative anisotropy along the tracts. The methods were compared with both traditional and more recent techniques for measuring disease burden in multiple sclerosis (T2 lesion load and "whole brain" diffusion histograms).; Results: Relative anisotropy and L, were significantly lower in patients than controls (p < 0.05). Pyramidal tract L, in the patients correlated significantly with both expanded disability status scale (r = -0.48, p < 0.05), and to-a greater degree, the pyramidal Kurtzke functional system score (KFS-p) (r = -0.75, p < 0.0001). T2 lesion load and diffusion histogram parameters did not correlate with disability.; Conclusions: Tract mapping using DTI is feasible and may increase the specificity of MRI in multiple sclerosis by matching appropriate tracts with specific clinical scoring systems. These techniques may be applicable to a wide range of neurological conditions.

N2  -  Doxycycline may potentially be a neuroprotective treatment for neonatal hypoxicischemic brain injury through its anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to examine any long-term neuroprotection by doxycycline treatment on cerebral gray and white matter. Hypoxicischemic brain injury was induced in 7-day-old rats. Pups were treated with either doxycycline (HI+doxy) or saline (HI+vehicle) by intraperitoneal injection at 1 h after hypoxiaischemia (HI). At 6 h after HI, MnCl2 was injected intraperitoneally for later manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was performed with diffusion-weighted imaging on day 1 and T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging at 7, 21 and 42 days after HI. Animals were killed after MRI on day 42 and histological examinations of the brains were performed. There was a tendency towards lower lesion volumes on diffusion maps among HI+doxy than HI+vehicle rats at 1 day after HI. Volumetric MRI showed increasing differences between groups with time after HI, with less cyst formation and less cerebral tissue loss among HI+doxy than HI+vehicle pups. HI+doxy pups had less manganese enhancement on day 7 after HI, indicating reduced inflammation. HI+doxy pups had higher fractional anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging in major white matter tracts in the injured hemisphere than HI+vehicle pups, indicating less injury to white matter and better myelination. Histological examinations supported the MRI results. Lesion size on early MRI was highly correlated with final injury measures. In conclusion, a single dose of doxycycline reduced long-term cerebral tissue loss and white matter injury after neonatal HI, with an increasing effect of treatment with time after injury.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Preoperative determination of the facial nerve (FN) course is essential to preserving its function. Neither regular preoperative imaging examination nor intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is able to determine the exact position of the FN. The diffusion tensor imaging based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) technique has been widely used for the preoperative noninvasive visualization of the neural fasciculus in the white matter of brain. However, further studies are required to establish its role in the preoperative visualization of the FN in acoustic neuroma surgery. The object of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using DTI-FT to visualize the FN.
METHODS Data from 15 patients with acoustic neuromas were collected using 3-T MRI. The visualized FN course and its position relative to the tumors were determined using DTI-FT with 3D Slicer software. The preoperative visualization results of FN tracking were verified using microscopic observation and electrophysiological monitoring during microsurgery.; RESULTS Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was observed in 93.3% of the patients. However, in 92.9% of the patients, the FN visualization results were consistent with the actual surgery.; CONCLUSIONS DTI-FT, in combination with intraoperative FN electrophysiological monitoring, demonstrated improved FN preservation in patients with acoustic neuroma. FN visualization mainly included the facial-vestibular nerve complex of the FN and vestibular nerve.

N2  -  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is available on all modern MR scanners. It depicts the motion of water molecules in the brain tissue and intracranial foreign tissues and provides information on changes in the proportion of intra- and extracellular space and the characteristics of foreign intracranial tissues and fluids. It is of utmost importance eg. in the diagnostics and differential diagnostics of acute ischaemic brain lesions, the diagnostics of inflammatory brain processes and in the differential diagnostics of intracranial space-occupying lesions. The examination method of short scanning and post-processing time must be completed with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and it is indispensable in the everyday neuroradiological diagnostics.
Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography are able to depict the white matter tracts. They require a longer scanning and post-processing time and have several technical problems yet to be solved, but they provide help in their current state e.g. in the surgical planning of intracranial space-occupying lesions.

T2  -  CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY

N2  -  Purpose of review Advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MR tractography have been increasingly used at every stage of the surgical management of brain gliomas, as a means to improve tumor resection while preserving brain functions. This review provides an overview of the last advancements in the field of functional MRI techniques, with a particular focus on their current clinical use and reliability in the preoperative and intraoperative setting, as well as their future perspectives for personalized multimodal management of patients with gliomas.
Recent findings fMRI and diffusion MR tractography give relevant insights on the anatomo-functional organization of eloquent cortical areas and subcortical connections near or inside a tumor. Task-based fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography have proven to be valid and highly sensitive tools for localizing the distinct eloquent cortical and subcortical areas before surgery in glioma patients; they also show good accuracy when compared with intraoperative stimulation mapping data. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity as well as new advanced HARDI (high angular resolution diffusion imaging) tractography methods are improving and reshaping the role of functional MRI for surgery of gliomas, with potential benefit for personalized treatment strategies.; Summary Noninvasive functional MRI techniques may offer the opportunity to perform a multimodal assessment in brain tumors, to be integrated with intraoperative mapping and clinical data for improving surgical management and oncological and functional outcome in patients affected by gliomas.

N2  -  Background/Aim. Microstructural diversity of brain astrocytomas makes their diagnostics and differentiation by using the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) difficult. In this study we used the histogram-based positioning of regions of interests on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in order to restrict the determination of diffusion parameters to regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to maximum cellularity. Success of ADC standard deviation (.ADC) and kurtosis (K) in differentiation of brain astrocytomas was evaluated. Methods. The thirtyone patients (16 women and 15 men, median age 37 years, age range 6-72 years) with suspected supratentorial astrocytomas were included in the retrospective study. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed using the 1.5 T MR system (Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and 8-channel phased array head coil. The DWI images were acquired in three orthogonal directions for the b-values 0, 500 and 1000 s mm(-2). The histogram calculations and determination of diffusion parameters were performed using the MIPAV software package and the statistical analysis was done in the Openstat software. Results. The ADC values enabled differentiation of diffuse astrocytomas (DA) from a high-grade astrocytoma (HGA), but not between the classes of HGA. In addition, the. ADC value provided discrimination between the anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with 100% of sensitivity and 89% of specificity. The kurtosis value can also differentiate between the grades AA and GBM although with the lower sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion. The histogram analysis of tumor region on the ADC maps can provide a guidance for an appropriate choice of the ROIs. The parameters which characterize diffusion of such defined ROIs, as well as their combination can improve differentiation of brain astrocytomas.

N2  -  The use of quantitative mapping of diffusion characteristics carries great potential for diagnosis and therapy of brain diseases, since it potentially allows to classify tumors, determine the degree of their malignancy, differentiate various morphological structures of tumor and non-tumor pathologies (such as tumor stroma, necrotic zones, cysts, various types of edema, etc.), and predict the course and outcome of diseases, in particular, a clinical response to treatment. Based on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is possible to perform 3D modeling of the white matter pathways of the brain, which is called tractography. In addition to a unique ability to visualize the location of tracts in relation to intracranial pathologies, this technology allows to build and analyze complex maps of communication networks in the brain (connectomics).
The review is devoted to the discussion of the physical and technical concept of diffusion weighted MRI, the key ways of its application in tumor and non-tumor processes, and problems that complicate correct interpretation of results. Since the problem of developing software for diffusion MRI data remains relevant, this review presents our own experience in developing an application as part of a project on creating effective methods for processing diffusion MRI data and modeling white matter tracts.

N2  -  Rationale: Germinomas are sensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy; therefore, correct imaging diagnosis is crucial for them. However, the imaging findings of germinomas originating from off-midline regions displayed different patterns from those originating from midline areas.
Patient concerns: The objective of this study is to describe the radiologic features of primary ectopic germinoma. We reviewed the MR and CT findings of 12 patients with histologically proven off-midline ectopic germinomas with off-midline locations.; Interventions: All of these patients underwent conventional MR images and 3 of them underwent diffusion images. Additional CT images were available in 3 patients. Analysis was focused on the shape and entity of tumors in images, signs of hemiatrophy, and the involvement of fibers in diffusion images.; Outcomes: Well-defined (812) and ill-defined margin masses (412) were identified according to the shape of the mass. Multicystic masses were seen in 11 of the 12 patients. The solid component of the tumors had a high density (33) with calcifications (23) on CT images, iso- to hypointensity in T2WI (1112) and restricted diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (33). Hemiatrophy was observed in 5 cases and progressive hemiatrophy was observed in 1 case. Other signs included mild peritumoral edema (1012), and hydrocephalus (712). Additionally, infiltration of the corticospinal tract (CST) was identified on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (22).; Lessons: The results indicate that multicysitic entities and hypointensities in solid components on T2WI and hemiatrophy are the imaging features of ectopic germinomas. DTI has potential for assessing CST involvement.

N2  -  Differentiating between brain abscesses and cystic brain tumors such as high-grade gliomas and metastases is often difficult with conventional MRI. The goal of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of perfusion MRI to differentiate between these pathologies. MRI was performed in 19 patients with rim-enhancing brain lesions (4 pyogenic abscesses, 8 high-grade gliomas, 7 metastases). In addition to standard MR sequences, trace diffusion-weighted MRI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and perfusion-weighted MRI by using a first-pass gadopentetate dimeglumine T2*-weighted gradient echo single-shot echo-planar sequence were performed. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratios were obtained via the values of the capsular portions of the lesions and the normal white matter. All the abscesses had markedly hyperintense signals in trace diffusion images, whereas they had significant hypointense signals in ADC images. In perfusion-weighted images, the capsular portions of the abscesses demonstrated low colored areas compared with the normal white matter and the rCBV ratio calculated was 0.76 +/- 0.12 (mean +/- SD). All but two of the cystic tumors showed low signal intensity on trace diffusion-weighted images and high signal intensity on ADC maps. Hyperintense signal was found in two brain tumors mimicking brain abscesses on trace diffusion images. The rCBV values in high-grade gliomas and metastases were 5.51 +/- 2.08 and 4.58 +/- 2.19, respectively. The difference between abscesses and cystic tumors was statistically significant (P = 0.003). Perfusion MRI may allow the differentiation of pyogenic brain abscess from cystic brain tumors, making it a strong additional imaging modality in the early diagnosis of these two entities.

N2  -  As a new tool to quantify primary motor pathways and predict postoperative motor deficits in children with focal epilepsy, the present study utilized a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) classification of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) tractography combined with Kalman filter. DWI was performed in 31 children with intractable focal epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery. Three primary motor pathways associated with finger, leg, and face were classified using DWI-MAP classifier and compared with the results of invasive electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The Kalman filter analysis was performed to generate a model to determine the probability of postoperative motor deficits as a function of the proximity between the resection margin and the finger motor pathway. The ROC curve analysis showed that the DWI-MAP achieves high accuracy up to 89% (finger), 88% (leg), 89% (face), in detecting the three motor areas within 20 mm, compared with ESM. Moreover, postoperative reduction of the fiber count of finger pathway was associated with postoperative motor deficits involving the hand. The prediction model revealed an accuracy of 92% in avoiding postoperative deficits if the distance between the resection margin and the finger motor pathway seen on preoperative DWI tractography was 19.5 mm. This study provides evidence that the DWI-MAP combined with Kalman filter can effectively identify the locations of cortical motor areas even in patients whose motor areas are difficult to identify using ESM, and also can serve as a reliable predictor for motor deficits following epilepsy surgery.

N2  -  Integration of the neural processes in the human brain is realized through interconnections that exist between different neural centers. These interconnections take place through white matter pathways. White matter tractography is currently the only available technique for the reconstruction of the anatomical connectivity in the human brain noninvasively and in vivo. The trajectory and terminations of white matter pathways are estimated from local orientations of nerve bundles. These orientations are obtained using measurements of water diffusion in the brain. In this article, the techniques for estimating fiber directions from diffusion measurements in the human brain are reviewed. Methods of white matter tractography are described, together with the current limitations of the technique, including sensitivity to image noise and partial voluming. The applications of white matter tractography to the topographical characterization of the white matter connections and the segmentation of specific white matter pathways, and corresponding functional units of gray matter, are discussed. In this context, the potential impact of white matter tractography in mapping the functional systems and subsystems in the human brain, and their interrelations, is described. Finally, the applications of white matter tractography to the study of brain disorders, including fiber tract localization in brains affected by tumors and the identification of impaired connectivity routes in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases, are discussed.

N2  -  Background: The prognosis of glioma patients is contingent on precise target selection for stereotactic biopsies and the extent of tumor resection. C-11-L-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates tumor heterogeneity and invasion with high diagnostic accuracy.
Purpose: To compare the spatial tumor distribution delineated by MET PET with that by perfusion-and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in order to understand the diagnostic value of these MRI methods, when PET is not available.; Material and Methods: Presurgical MET PET and MRI, including perfusion-and diffusion-weighted MRI, were acquired in 13 patients (7 high-grade gliomas, 6 low-grade gliomas). A quantitative volume of interest analysis was performed to compare the modalities objectively, supplemented by a qualitative evaluation that assessed the clinical applicability.; Results: The inaccuracy of conventional MRI was confirmed (area under the curve for predicting voxels with high MET uptake = 0.657), whereas cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps calculated from perfusion data improved accuracy (area under the curve = 0.760). We considered CBV maps diagnostically comparable to MET PET in 57 cases of high-grade gliomas, but insufficient in all cases of low-grade gliomas when evaluated subjectively. Cerebral blood flow and apparent diffusion coefficient maps did not contribute to further accuracy.; Conclusion: Adding perfusion-weighted MRI to the presurgical protocol can increase the diagnostic accuracy of conventional MRI and is a simple and well-established method compared to MET PET. However, the definition of low-grade gliomas with subtle or no alterations on cerebral blood volume maps remains a diagnostic challenge for stand-alone MRI.

N2  -  Ischemic stroke results from arterial occlusion and can cause irreversible brain injury. A non-human primate (NHP) model of ischemic stroke was previously developed to investigate its pathophysiology and for efficacy testing of therapeutic candidates; however, fine motor impairment remains to be well-characterized. We evaluated hand motor function in a cynomolgus monkey model of ischemic stroke. Endovascular transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with an angiographic microcatheter induced cerebral infarction. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging mapped and measured the ischemia-induced infarct lesion. In vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the stroke lesion to assess the neuroplastic changes and fiber tractography demonstrated three-dimensional patterns in the corticospinal tract 12 weeks after MCAO. The hand dexterity task (HDT) was used to evaluate fine motor movement of upper extremity digits. The HDT was modified for a home cage-based training system, instead of conventional chair restraint training. The lesion was localized in the middle cerebral artery territory, including the sensorimotor cortex. Maximum infarct volume was exhibited over the first week after MCAO, which progressively inhibited ischemic core expansion, manifested by enhanced functional recovery of the affected hand over 12 weeks after MCAO. The total performance time decreased with increasing success rate for both hands on the HDT. Compensatory strategies and retrieval failure improved in the chronic phase after stroke. Our findings demonstrate the recovery of fine motor skill after stroke, and outline the behavioral characteristics and features of functional disorder of NHP stroke model, providing a basis for assessing hand motor function after stroke.

N2  -  There are a lot of diseases that can show restricted diffusion on brain MRI. While it is almost always present in some of them, it can be seen only occasionally in others, in which case it is usually associated with a more severe prognosis. Additional MRI sequences and clinical presentation aid in the differential diagnosis. The aim of this review is to enlist and describe diseases that can present with restricted diffusion on brain MRI. Restricted diffusion is most often found in acute ischemia and it is also typically present in an abscess or empyema as well as in lymphomas and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. It can also be found in highly cellular tumors, certain metastases, diffuse axonal injury, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Wernicke's encephalopathy, Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome, osmotic demyelination syndrome, hypo-/hyperglycemia, Rathke's cleft cysts, acute-stage Wilson's disease, carbon monoxide poisoning, and, rarely, in MS and epilepsy. Restricted diffusion is assessed on diffusion-weighted images (DWI). It can only be valid in the case of a simultaneous finding of a hypersignal area on DWI with a higher b value (usually b = 1,000) and of a hyposignal area in the same location on apparent diffusion coefficient maps.

N2  -  Objective: This study was undertaken to characterize the neuroimaging findings of cerebral edema associated with eclamptic seizures by use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Study design: During the 3-year period ending March 2002, 27 nulliparous women with eclampsia were evaluated with diffusion-weighted MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. Those with findings of restricted diffusion suggestive of cytotoxic edema underwent neuroimaging again 6 weeks post partum.; Results: All but 2 of these 27 women (93%) had reversible vasogenic edema. Six were also found to have areas of cytotoxic edema consistent with cerebral infarction. Five of these 6 women had persistent imaging findings of infarction when studied post partum, however, without clinical neurologic deficits.; Conclusion: The spectrum of cerebral lesions in eclampsia as seen with MRI varies from initially reversible areas of vasogenic edema that may progress to cytotoxic edema and infarction in up to a fourth of women.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine whether the perfusion deficit could predict brain infarction in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia who experienced recurring episodes of neurological symptoms and showed a perfusion-diffusion mismatch on magnetic resonance (MR) images.
Materials and Methods: In 53 consecutive patients (38 males and 15 females, 62 +- 13 years old) with ischemia in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, lesion volumetry was performed on parametric maps of the time-to-peak, the cerebral blood volume, and diffusion-weighted (DW) images. The infarct lesions were assessed on follow-up T2-weighted (T2W) MR images after eight days. Cerebrovascular changes were determined by time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography (MRA). Inferential and correlation statistics were used.; Results: Patients with chronic ischemic brain disease (N = 39) who presented With a severe perfusion-diffusion mismatch in the presence of a normal cerebral blood volume had no or small brain infarctions as found on follow-up T2W images. MRA revealed Widespread abnormalities of the basal cerebral arteries compatible with brain perfusion abnormalities. In, contrast, in acute stroke patients (N = 14) the deficit of cerebral perfusion predicted the infarct lesion in the T2W images.; Conclusion: Our results suggest that in chronic cerebral ischemia the normal blood, volume was maintained despite the depression of cerebral perfusion and recurring minor insults.

N2  -  Introduction. Cerebral aspergillosis is a rare and severe disease generally observed in immunocompromised patients. Diffusion-weighted imaging has rarely been reported, but might be helpful for early differential diagnosis.
Methods. We describe the cases of three patients presenting cerebral aspergillosis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are reported.; Results. A total of 23 circular lesions, with or without rim enhancement were identified in our three patients. Eleven lesions were very bright on DW MRI, with reduced ADC values. Twelve lesions, which were either enhancing or not enhancing, presented a "target-like" aspect with central and peripheral hypointense areas on DW MRI, corresponding to areas with a higher ADC, and intermediate marked hypersignal on DW MRI with low ADC values.; Discussion. Typical aspects of aspergillosis lesions on the DW MRI may allow early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral aspergillosis. DW MRI is helpful for differentiating aspergillosis lesions from other infectious or malignant lesions affecting immunocompromised patients.

N2  -  Introduction. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR-based technique that may better detect the peritumoural region than MRI. Our aim was to explore the feasibility of using DTI for target volume delineation in glioblastoma patients.
Materials and methods. MR tensor tracts and maps of the isotropic (p) and anisotropic (q) components of water diffusion were coregistered with CT in 13 glioblastoma patients. An in-house image processing program was used to analyse water diffusion in each voxel of interest in the region of the tumour. Tumour infiltration was mapped according to validated criteria and contralateral normal brain was used as an internal control. A clinical target volume (CTV) was generated based on the T-1-weighted image obtained using contrast agent (T-1Gd), tractography and the infiltration map. This was compared to a conventional T-2-weighted CTV (T-2-w CTV).; Results. Definition of a diffusion-based CTV that included the adjacent white matter tracts proved highly feasible. A statistically significant difference was detected between the DTI-CTV and T-2-w CTV volumes (p < 0.005, t = 3.480). As the DTI-CTVs were smaller than the T-2-w CTVs (tumour plus peritumoural oedema), the pq maps were not simply detecting oedema. Compared to the clinical planning target volume (PTV), the DTI-PTV showed a trend towards volume reduction. These diffusion-based volumes were smaller than conventional volumes, yet still included sites of tumour recurrence.; Conclusion. Extending the CTV along the abnormal tensor tracts in order to preserve coverage of the likely routes of dissemination, whilst sparing uninvolved brain, is a rational approach to individualising radiotherapy planning for glioblastoma patients.

N2  -  Our study explores the potential of conventional and advanced diffusion MRI techniques including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and single-shell 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (SS3T-CSD) to investigate complex microstructural changes following severe traumatic brain injury in rats at a chronic phase. Rat brains after sham-operation or lateral fluid percussion (LFP) injury were scanned ex vivo in a 9.4 T scanner. Our region-of-interest-based approach of tensor-, and SS3T-CSD derived fixel-, 3-tissue signal fraction maps were sensitive to changes in both white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) areas. Tensor-based measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), detected more changes in WM and GM areas as compared to fixel-based measures including apparent fiber density (AFD), peak FOD amplitude and primary fiber bundle density, while 3-tissue signal fraction maps revealed distinct changes in WM, GM, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) fractions highlighting the complex tissue microstructural alterations post-trauma. Track-weighted imaging demonstrated changes in track morphology including reduced curvature and average pathlength distal from the primary lesion in severe TBI rats. In histological analysis, changes in the diffusion MRI measures could be associated to decreased myelin density, loss of myelinated axons, and increased cellularity, revealing progressive microstructural alterations in these brain areas five months after injury. Overall, this study highlights the use of combined conventional and advanced diffusion MRI measures to obtain more precise insights into the complex tissue microstructural alterations in chronic phase of severe brain injury.

N2  -  Focal lesions of brainstem, thalamus, and subcortical white matter may cause movement disorders that are clinically indistinguishable from cerebellar symptoms. It is suspected that ataxia in these cases is due to damage of efferent or afferent pathways of the cerebellum. However, the precise anatomical correlate often remains undefined. We used deterministic diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) tractography to study the anatomical relationship between lesions causing ataxia and efferent cerebellar pathways. Study subjects were six male patients with focal lesions of different etiology (demyelination, hemorrhage, ischemia, neoplasm) outside the cerebellum. Five patients had cerebellar-like ataxia with prominent contralateral upper limb involvement. One patient with an almost midline mesencephalic lesion had a symmetrical ataxic syndrome. We used 3T MRI (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) and DTI tractography (32 directions, StealthViz DTI, Medtronic Navigation, Louisville, USA) to delineate the dentato-rubro-thalamo-cortical tract (DRT). In all patients, tractography demonstrated focal lesions affecting the DRT in different locations. We conclude that in vivo mapping of cerebral pathways using DTI tractography in patients with focal extracerebellar brain lesions may provide direct evidence of circumscribed damage to the DRT, causing unilateral cerebellar-like ataxia. Also, a unilateral mesencephalic lesion at the level of the crossing of the DRT may cause bilateral ataxia.

T2  -  EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

N2  -  The cerebral ultrasound has been used many years for the diagnosis of brain lesions in term and preterm newborns. Major improvements were obtained by the combination of different imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging with the Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and the new quantitative Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The clinical use of MRI has been validated over some years especially to depict the perinatal asphyxia lesions in term newborns, but its use in order to diagnose the typical diseases of preterm babies is very recent and useful in identifying a marker able to predict neurological outcome.
The imaging correlates for motor impairment are well recognized (periventricular white matter cavitations). but no any imaging correlate for cognitive impairment and neurobehavioral disorders. While DWI has been used in term newborns to identify the ischemic areas with restricted diffusion, it may be also used to characterize brain development in preterm infants with the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and may allow us to detect abnormalities responsible for the non-motor impairments. Recent datas showed that in infants without focal lesions higher ADC values in WM were associated with poorer neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years. The DTI also allows to detect the Fractional Anisotropy (FA) that measures the microstructure. DTI can also be used to map the WM tracts in the immature brain and may be applied to understand the normal development or the response of the brain to injury. Some WM regions in the preterm brain have a lower FA suggesting that widespread WM abnormalities are present in preterms even in the absence of focal lesions. The complexity of the developing brain can be explained by the new tractography that can assess the connectivity of different WM regions and the association between structure and function, Such as optic radiations microstructure and visual assessment score.; Technological advances in neonatal brain imaging have made a major contribution to understand the neurobehavioral disorders of the developing brain that have the origin in the early structural cerebral organization and maturation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Prelemniscal radiations (Raprl) are composed of different fiber tracts, connecting the brain stem and cerebellum with basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. In Parkinson disease (PD), lesions in Raprl induce improvement of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia in some patients, while others show improvement of only 1 or 2 symptoms, suggesting different fiber tracts mediate different symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To search for correlations between improvements of specific symptoms with surgical lesions of specific fiber tract components of Raprl in patients with PD.; METHODS: A total of 10 patients were treated with unilateral radiofrequency lesions directed to Raprl. The improvement for tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, posture, and gait was evaluated at 24 to 33 mo after operation through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, and the precise location and extension of lesions through structural magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography at 6 to 8 mo postsurgery. Correlation between percentage of fiber tract involvement and percentage of UPDRS-III score improvement was evaluated through Spearman's correlation coefficient.; RESULTS: Group average improvement was 86% for tremor, 62% for rigidity, 56% for bradykinesia, and 45% for gait and posture. Improvement in global UPDRS score correlated with extent of lesions in fibers connecting with contralateral cerebellar cortex and improvement of posture and gait with fibers connecting with contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei. Lesion of fibers connecting the globus pallidum with pedunculopontine nucleus induced improvement of gait and posture over other symptoms.; CONCLUSION: Partial lesion of Raprl fibers resulted in symptom improvement at 2-yr follow-up. Lesions of selective fiber components may result in selective improvement of specific symptoms.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging shows evidence of brain injury and/or maldevelopment in 70%-90% of children with cerebral palsy (CP), though its capability to identify specific white matter tract injury is limited. The great variability of white matter lesions in CP already demonstrated by postmortem studies is thought to be one of the reasons why response to treatment is so variable. Our hypothesis is that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a suitable technique to provide in vivo characterization of specific white matter tract lesions in children with CP associated with periventricular eukonnalacia (PVL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 24 children with CP associated with PVL and 35 healthy controls were evaluated with DTI. Criteria for identification of 26 white matter tracts on the basis of 2D DTI color-coded maps were established, and a qualitative scoring system, based on visual inspection of the tracts in comparison with age-matched controls, was used to grade the severity of abnormalities. An ordinal grading system (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal, 2 = severely abnormal or absent) was used to score each white matter tract.; RESULTS: There was marked variability in white matter injury pattern in patients with PVL, with the most frequent injury to the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, superior corona radiata, and commissural fibers.; CONCLUSION: IDTI is a suitable technique for in vivo assessment of specific white matter lesions in patients with PVL and, thus, a potentially valuable diagnostic tool. The tract-specific evaluation revealed a family of tracts that are highly susceptible in PVL, important information that can potentially be used to tailor treatment options in the future.

N2  -  Various surgical brain ablation procedures for the treatment of refractory depression were developed in the twentieth century. Most notably, key target sites were (i) the anterior cingulum, (ii) the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and (iii) the subcaudate white matter, which were regarded as effective targets. Long-term symptom remissions were better following lesions of the anterior internal capsule and subcaudate white matter than of the cingulum. It is possible that the observed clinical improvements of these various surgical procedures may reflect shared influences on presently unspecified brain affect-regulating networks. Such possibilities can now be analyzed using modern brain connectivity procedures such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. We determined whether the shared connectivities of the above lesion sites in healthy volunteers might explain the therapeutic effects of the various surgical approaches. Accordingly, modestly sized historical lesions, especially of the anatomical overlap areas, were 'implanted' in brain-MRI scans of 53 healthy subjects. These were entered as seed regions for probabilistic DTI connectivity reconstructions. We analyzed for the shared connectivities of bilateral anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and stereotactic limbic leucotomy (a combination of the last two lesion sites). Shared connectivities between the four surgical approaches mapped onto the most mediobasal aspects of bilateral frontal lobe fibers, including the forceps minor and the anterior thalamic radiations that contacted subgenual cingulate regions. Anatomically, convergence of these shared connectivities may derive from the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), a structure that connects these frontal areas to the origin of the mesolimbic dopaminergic 'reward' system in the midbrain ventral tegmental area. Thus, all four surgical anti-depressant approaches may be promoting positive affect by converging influences onto the MFB.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of relative cerebral blood volume, apparent diffusion coefficient and spectroscopic imaging in differentiating between cerebral abscesses and necrotic tumours. In the prospective study, a 3-tesla MR unit was used to perform proton MR spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion imaging in 20 patients with cerebral abscesses and 26 patients who had solitary brain tumours (14 high-grade gliomas and 12 metastases). We found the mean apparent diffusion coefficient value at the central cavities of the cerebral abscesses to be significantly lower than in necrotic tumours. The mean relative cerebral blood volume values of the necrotic tumour wall were statistically significantly higher than the mean relative cerebral blood volume values of the cerebral abscess wall by the Student's t-test. The proton spectra obtained revealed amino acids only in the cerebral abscesses. Although the conventional MRI characteristics of cerebral abscesses and necrotic tumours may sometimes be similar, diffusion, perfusion-weighted and spectroscopic MRI enables distinction between the two.

N2  -  Objective: To demonstrate the role of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in preoperative mapping of eloquent tracts in relation to cerebral tumors and to determine whether it is helpful for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment.
Methods and materials: Sixteen patients with brain tumors underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The pyramidal tract, corpus callosum and optic radiation were reconstructed and the exact location of a lesion with respect to these tracts was observed to design a reasonable surgical plan for preserving vital tracts while maximizing tumor resection. After surgery, DTI was performed again and these tracts were evaluated to investigate the surgical outcomes. Twenty-four patients with suspicion of pyramidal tract involvement were also evaluated as a control group.; Results: The relationship between tracts and tumors was classified as three types: type I is simple displacement, type II is displacement with disruption and type III is simple disruption. Twelve cases involved in pyramidal tract (DTT group), one was type I with reduction of displacement after surgery, nine were type II with reduction of displacement and other two were type III without any improvement. The extent of tumor resection (p = 0.045) and postoperative improvement of locomotive function (p = 0.015) of DTT group were significantly higher than those of control group. Corpus callosum was involved in seven cases, three were type 11 with reduction of displacement and four were type III without any improvement. Optic radiation was involved in three cases, all were type I with reduction of displacement.; Conclusion: DTT allowed for visualization of the exact location of tumors relevant to eloquent tracts and was found to be beneficial in the neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment.

N2  -  Neuroimaging of brain tumors has evolved from a strictly morphology-based discipline to one that encompasses function, physiology, and anatomy. This review outlines the current imaging standard for patients with brain tumor and summarizes the latest advances in physiology-based imaging methods that complement traditional brain tumor imaging protocols. Emphasis is on the strength and limitations of the current imaging standards and on an overview of several advanced imaging methods including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), perfusion MRI, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) imaging. Basic physical principles behind each imaging method are briefly presented, along with a more in-depth discussion of clinical application and potential pitfalls of each technique.

N2  -  Recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography studies indicate that the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) represents a relay between frontal and temporal language sites. Some authors postulate that pathways connecting SMG to the posterior temporal lobe, i.e., the posterior part of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) subserve semantic aspects of language. However, DTI provides only anatomic but not functional data. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude. Interestingly, intra-operative electrical mapping of cortical and subcortical language structures during tumor surgery is recognized as a reliable technique in functional neuroanatomy research. We mapped the underlying white matter of the SMG, especially the SLF, in 11 patients who underwent awake surgery for a glioma involving the left inferior parietal lobule. Using direct electrostimulation, we investigated the exact role of the SLF in language. Our findings indicate that the white matter under the inferior parietal lobule is highly involved in the dorsal phonological system. First, the SMG, connected to the ventral premotor cortex by horizontal fibers of the SLF, subserves articulatory processing, as demonstrated by dysarthria elicited by stimulation. Second, long arcuate fibers, found deeper in the white matter, subserve phonological processing, as supported by phonemic paraphasia induced by electrostimulation. Third, the most important result is that no semantic disturbances were elicited by stimulating the SLF, including its posterior part. Furthermore, no semantic disorders occurred postoperatively. Subcortical brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation does not provide arguments for a possible role of the left SLF in language semantic processing.

We also discuss potential future applications, including implementation of resting state functional MRI. We then discuss perfusion and diffusion-weighted imaging and their application in advanced neuro-oncologic practice. We explain how these modalities can be helpful in guiding surgical biopsies and differentiating recurrent tumor from treatment related changes.

N2  -  Objectives. The role of the microsurgical management of intrinsic brain tumors is to maximize the volumetric resection of the tumoral tissue minimizing the postoperative morbidity. The purpose of our paper has been to study the benefits of an original protocol developed for the microsurgical treatment of tumors located in eloquent motor areas where the navigation and electrical stimulation of motor subcortical pathways have been implemented.
Materials and methods. A total of 17 patients operated on for resection of cortical or subcortical tumors in motor areas were included in the series. Preoperative planning for multimodal navigation was done integrating anatomic studies, motor functional MRI (f-MRI) and subcortical pathways volumes generated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Intraoperative neuromonitorization included motor mapping by direct cortical and subcortical electrical stimulation (CS and sCS) and localization of the central sulcus using cortical multipolar electrodes and the N20 wave inversion technique. The location of all cortical and subcortical stimulated points with positive motor response was stored in the navigator and correlated with the cortical or subcortical motor functional structures defined preoperatively.; Results. The mean tumoral volumetric resection was 89.1 +- 14.2% of the preoperative volume, with a total resection (>= 100%) in twelve patients. Preoperatively a total of 58.8% of the patients had some motor deficit, increasing 24 hours after surgery to 76.5% and decreasing to 41.1% a month later. There was a great correlation between anatomic and functional data, both cortically and subcortically. However, in six cases it was not possible to identify the central sulcus and in many cases fMR1 gave contradictory information. A total of 52 cortical points submitted to CS had positive motor response, with a positive correlation of 83.7%. Also, a total of 55 subcortical points had positive motor response, being in these cases 7.3 +- 3.1 mm the mean distance from the stimulated point to the subcortical tract.; Conclusions. The integration of preoperative and intraoperative anatomic and functional studies allows a safe functional resection of the brain tumors located in eloquent areas, compared to the tumoral resection based on anatomic imaging studies. Multimodal navigation allows the integration and correlation among preoperative and intraoperative anatomic and functional data. Cortical motor functional areas are anatomically and functionally located preoperatively thanks to MRI and fMRI and subcortical motor pathways with TDI and tractography. Intraoperative confirmation is done with CS and N20 inversion wave for cortical structures and with sCS for subcortical pathways. With this protocol we achieved a mean of 90% of volumetric resection in cortical and subcortical tumors located in eloquent motor areas with an increase of neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period that significantly decreased one month later. Ongoing studies will define the safe limits for functional resection taking into account the intraoperative brain shift. Finally, it must be demonstrated if this protocol has any benefit for patients concerning disease free or everall survival.

N2  -  Brainstem is surrounded by noteworthy dense packed white matter fibers which must be preserved during surgery. Brain stem surgery carries serious risks. It is very important to know about the localization of the tumor and the eloquent white matter tracts for surgery decision and for preoperative neurosurgical planning. In this report, four cases with brain stem mass were discussed. The three of them were operated and the one of the four cases was referred to Oncology department for radiotherapy in which major fibers could not be preserved based on White matter tractography (WMT) and Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings.

N2  -  Purpose: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the differences in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between infra and supratentorial unidentified bright objects (UBOs), between UBOs and normal appearing side (NAS, contralateral regions of the UBOs and/or normal appearing region without UBOs) in the neurofibromatosis type 1 patients (NF1) and control group and also to investigate correlation between age and ADC values.
Methods: A total of 30 patients and 26 healthy controls were included. The MRI examination consisted of routine imaging and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Seven distinct locations (frontal, parieto-occipital and cerebellar white matter, globus pallidum, thalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain) were selected for the analysis. The ADC values were calculated directly from these automatically generated ADC maps with ROI.; Results: The ADC values of UBOs were significantly increased in cerebellar white matter, hippocampus, globus pallidum, midbrain, and thalamus when compared with NAS and control group. There were statistically significant differences between NAS and control group in the ADC values obtained from hippocampus and thalamus. There were statistically significant differences between supra and infratentorial UBOs in ADC values. There was a negative correlation between age and the ADC values obtained from normal appearing midbrain, hippocampus, thalamus, and globus pallidum.; Conclusion: ADC values both in UBOs and in the normal appearing locations as hippocampus and thalamus were detected to be higher in the patients with NF1. The detection of lesions might be independent of MRI appearance in NF1, i.e. although the brain is affected, MRI appearance may be normal. Therefore, DWI and ADC values should also be utilized in the delineation of brain involvement of NF1 patients. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced diffusion weighted imaging technique that can identify early stage lesions and Wallerian degeneration within the spinal cord; these changes are difficult to recognise on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The only DTI parameters previously investigated in dogs are fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD). The aim of this study was to evaluate multiple DTI parameters in sub-regional areas of the spinal cord in normal Beagles. All imaging data were obtained from the lumbar spinal cord (L1-L3) of ten normal dogs using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Transverse multi-shot echo planar imaging sequences (b values = 0 and 800 s/mm(2); 12 directions) were used for DTI. Regions of interest were selected from sub-regions of the white and grey matter, and from the whole spinal cord, in the transverse plane in all DTI maps. The DTI parameters in spinal cord sub-regions in the transverse plane were significantly different amongst the white matter, grey matter and whole spinal cord (P < 0.05 for all DTI parameters except MD), as well as between white matter subregions (P < 0.05 for most DTI parameters except radial diffusivity, MD and planar index). DTI-based sub regional analysis of white and grey matter may be useful for regional evaluation of the dog spinal cord. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is one of the forms of motor neuron disease (MND), affecting only upper motor neurons. The diagnosis of PLS should be made on different diagnostic criteria, for example, Pringle or Gordon, but it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. There are no characteristic findings in standard laboratory and electrophysiological assessment. We present details of a 31-year-old woman who had suffered from progressive paraparesis with right-side predominance. Conventional MRI of brain and spinal cord and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies showed Hyperintense lesions in the upper part of the cervical spinal cord at the level C1 in lateral funicules, in the medulla oblongata at the pyramidal decussation and in the midbrain. Brain DTI revealed changes along the corticospinal tracts on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. MRI of the thoracic spinal cord showed in T2-weighted images hyperintensive regions in the course of the lateral corticospinal tracts. This aided in PLS recognition.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Resection of brain tumors in language-eloquent areas entails the risk of postoperative aphasia. It has been demonstrated via navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) that language function can partially shift to the unaffected hemisphere due to tumor-induced plasticity. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate whether interhemispheric connectivity (IC) detected by nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI-FT) can be used to predict surgery-related aphasia in patients with brain tumors.
METHODS Thirty-eight patients with left-sided perisylvian brain lesions underwent cortical language mapping of both hemispheres by nTMS prior to awake surgery. Then, nTMS-based DTI-FT was conducted with a fractional anisotropy (FA) of 0.01 and 0.2 to visualize nTMS-based IC. Receiver operating characteristics were calculated for the prediction of a postoperative (irrespective of the preoperative state) and a new surgery-related aphasia by the presence of detectable IC.; RESULTS Language mapping by nTMS was possible in all patients. Seventeen patients (44.7%) suffered from surgery related worsening of language performance (transient aphasia according to 3-month follow-up in 16 subjects 42.1%; new permanent aphasia according to 3-month follow-up in 1 patient 2.6%). Regarding the correlation of aphasia to nTMS-based IC, statistically significant differences were revealed for both evaluated FA values. However, better results were observed for tractography with an FA of 0.2, which led to a specificity of 93% (postoperative aphasia) and 90% (surgery-related aphasia). For postoperative aphasia, the corresponding OR was 0.1282 (95% CI 0.0143-1.1520), and for surgery-related aphasia the OR was 0.1184 (95% CI 0.0208-0.6754).; CONCLUSIONS According to these results, IC detected by preoperative nTMS-based DTI-FT might be regarded as a risk factor for surgery-related aphasia, with a specificity of up to 93%. However, because the majority of enrolled patients suffered from transient aphasia postoperatively, it has to be evaluated whether this approach distinctly leads to similar results among patients with permanent language deficits. Despite this restriction, this approach might contribute to individualized patient consultation prior to tumor resection in clinical practice.

N2  -  Changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are well established in acute ischemic stroke of arterial origin. However, ADC behaviour and its prognostic significance in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are not fully understood. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings in a 34-year old woman with deep cerebral venous thrombosis are described. Recent literature concerning DWI and cerebral venous thrombosis is also reviewed. A MRI performed within 7 hours from onset revealed hyperintensities in deep grey matter bilaterally (FLAIR/T2), without changes in ADC maps, suggesting vasogenic edema. After anticoagulation a new MRA disclosed complete recanalization. of venous thrombosis. Despite her good clinical outcome the MRI showed hemorrhagic lesions suggesting venous infarct. Lesions detected in acute CVT with DWI may have normal ADC values. There is no good correlation between the acute ADC values and clinical and radiological evolution. The prognostic value of ADC in the acute phase of CVT remains unsettled.

N2  -  Despite recent improvements in diffusion-weighted imaging, spinal cord tractography is not used in routine clinical practice because of difficulties in reconstructing tractograms, with a pertinent tri-dimensional-rendering, in a tong post-processing time. We propose a new full tractography approach to the cervical spinal cord without extensive manual filtering or multiple regions of interest seeding that could help neurosurgeons manage various spinal cord disorders. Four healthy volunteers and two patients with either cervical intramedullary tumors or spinal cord injuries were included. Diffusion-weighted images of the cervical spinal cord were acquired using a Philips 3 Testa machine, 32 diffusion directions, 1,000 s/mm(2) b-value, 2 x 2 x 2 mm voxel size, reduced field-of-view (ZOOM), with two opposing phase-encoding directions. Distortion corrections were then achieved using the FSL software package, and tracking of the full cervical spinal cord was performed using the DSI Studio software (quantitative anisotropy-based deterministic algorithm). A unique region of avoidance was used to exclude everything that is not of the nervous system. Fiber tracking parameters used adaptative fractional anisotropy from 0.015 to 0.045, fiber length from 10 to 1,000 mm, and angular threshold of 90 degrees. In all participants, a full cervical cord tractography was performed from the medulla to the C7 spine level. On a ventral view, the junction between the medulla and spinal cord was identified with its pyramidal bulging, and by an invagination corresponding to the median ventral sulcus. On a dorsal view, the fourth ventricle-superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles-was seen, as well as its floor and the obex; and gracile and cuneate tracts were recognized on each side of the dorsal median sulcus. In the case of the intramedullary tumor or spinal cord injury, the spinal tracts were seen to be displaced, and this helped to adjust the neurosurgical strategy. This new full tractography approach simplifies the tractography pipeline and provides a reliable 3D-rendering of the spinal cord that could help to adjust the neurosurgical strategy.

N2  -  Clinical diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in humans started in the last decade with the demonstration of the capabilities of this technique of depicting the anatomy of the white matter fibre tracts in the brain.
Two main approaches in terms of reconstruction and evaluation of the images obtained with application of diffusion sensitising gradients to an echo planar imaging sequence are possible. The first approach consists of reconstruction of images in which the effect of white matter anisotropy is averaged - known as the isotropic or diffusion weighted images, which are usually evaluated subjectively for possible areas of increased or decreased signal, reflecting restricted and facilitated diffusion, respectively. The second approach implies reconstruction of image maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in which the T2 weighting of the echo planar diffusion sequence is cancelled out, and their objective, i.e. numerical, evaluation with regions of interest or histogram analysis. This second approach enables a quantitative and reproducible assessment of the diffusion changes not only in areas exhibiting signal abnormality in conventional MR images but also in areas of normal signal. A further level of image post-processing requires the acquisition of images after application of sensitising gradients along at least 6 different spatial orientations and consists of computation of the diffusion tensor and reconstruction of maps of the mean diffusivity (D) and of the white matter anisotropic properties, usually in terms of fractional anisotropy (FA).; Diffusion-weighted imaging is complementary to conventional MR imaging in the evaluation of the acute ischaemic stroke. The combination of diffusion and perfusion MR imaging has the potential of providing all the information necessary for the diagnosis and management of the individual patient with acute ischaemic stroke.; Diffusion-weighted MR, in particular quantitative evaluation based on the diffusion tensor, has a fundamental role in the assessment of brain maturation and of white matter diseases in the fetus, in the neonate and in the child. Diffusion MR imaging enables a better characterisation of the lesions demonstrated by conventional MR imaging, for instance in the hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, in infections and in the inherited metabolic diseases, and is particularly important for the longitudinal evaluation of these conditions.; Diffusion-weighted MR imaging has an established role in the differential diagnosis between brain abscess and cystic tumour and between epidermoid tumour and arachnoid cyst. On the other hand, the results obtained with diffusion MR in the characterisation of type and extension of glioma do not yet allow decision making in the individual patient. Diffusion is one of the most relevant MR techniques to have contributed to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, it improves the specificity of MR in characterising the different pathological substrata underlying the rather uniform lesion appearance on the conventional images and enables detection of damage in the normal-appearing white and grey matter. In MS patients the ADC or D values in the normal-appearing white matter are increased as compared to control values, albeit to a lesser degree than in the lesions demonstrated by T2-weighted images.; In addition, the D of the normal appearing grey matter is increased in MS patients and this change correlates with the cognitive deficit of these patients. Histogram analysis in MS patients shows that the peak of the brain D is decreased and right-shifted, reflecting an increase of its value, and the two features correlate with the patient's clinical disability.; Ageing is associated to a mild but significant increase of the brain ADC orb which is predominantly due to changes in the white matter. Region of interest and histogram studies have demonstrated that (D) over bar or ADC are increased in either the areas of leukoaraiosis or the normal-appearing white matter in patients with inherited cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and stroke or sporadic ischaemic leukoencephalopathy. Diffusion changes might be a more sensitive marker for progression of the disease than conventional imaging findings.; In neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary ataxias and motor neuron disease, quantitative diffusion MR demonstrates the cortical and subcortical grey matter damage, which is reflected in a regional increase of (D) over bar or ADC, but also reveals the concomitant white matter changes that are associated with an increase in (D) over bar or ADC and decrease in FA. In all these diseases the diffusion changes are correlated to the clinical deficit and are potentially useful for early diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation, especially in the context of pharmacological trials.

N2  -  Susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging technique that characterizes the anisotropic tissue magnetic susceptibility with a second-order tensor model. STI has the potential to provide information for both the reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways and detection of myelin changes in the brain at mm resolution or less, which would be of great value for understanding brain structure and function in healthy and diseased brain. However, the application of STI in vivo has been hindered by its cumbersome and time-consuming acquisition requirement of measuring susceptibility induced MR phase changes at multiple head orientations. Usually, sampling at more than six orientations is required to obtain sufficient information for the ill-posed STI dipole inversion. This complexity is enhanced by the limitation in head rotation angles due to physical constraints of the head coil. As a result, STI has not yet been widely applied in human studies in vivo. In this work, we tackle these issues by proposing an image reconstruction algorithm for STI that leverages data-driven priors. Our method, called DeepSTI, learns the data prior implicitly via a deep neural network that approximates the proximal operator of a regularizer function for STI. The dipole inversion problem is then solved iteratively using the learned proximal network. Experimental results using both simulation and in vivo human data demonstrate great improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the reconstructed tensor image, principal eigenvector maps and tractography results, while allowing for tensor reconstruction with MR phase measured at much less than six different orientations. Notably, promising reconstruction results are achieved by our method from only one orientation in human in vivo, and we demonstrate a potential application of this technique for estimating lesion susceptibility anisotropy in patients with multiple sclerosis.

N2  -  Abnormal vascular phenotypes have been implicated in neuropathologies ranging from Alzheimer's disease to brain tumors. The development of transgenic mouse models of such diseases has created a crucial need for characterizing the murine neurovasculature. Although histologic techniques are excellent for imaging the microvasculature at submicron resolutions, they offer only limited coverage. It is also challenging to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) vasculature and other structures, such as white matter tracts, after tissue sectioning. Here, we describe a novel method for 3D whole-brain mapping of the murine vasculature using magnetic resonance microscopy (mu MRI), and its application to a preclinical brain tumor model. The 3D vascular architecture was characterized by six morphologic parameters: vessel length, vessel radius, microvessel density, length per unit volume, fractional blood volume, and tortuosity. Region-of-interest analysis showed significant differences in the vascular phenotype between the tumor and the contralateral brain, as well as between postinoculation day 12 and day 17 tumors. These results unequivocally show the feasibility of using mu MRI to characterize the vascular phenotype of brain tumors. Finally, we show that combining these vascular data with coregistered images acquired with diffusion-weighted MRI provides a new tool for investigating the relationship between angiogenesis and concomitant changes in the brain tumor microenvironment.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI has mainly been used for detection of acute ischemia, and for distinction of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. We applied diffusion MRI in patients with tuberous sclerosis in order to evaluate diffusion imaging characteristics of parenchymal changes. Five children with known tuberous sclerosis were included in this study. The MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T MR unit. Diffusion MRI was obtained using the echo-planar imaging sequence. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from the abnormal brain parenchyma were: calculated directly from automatically generated ADC maps. Seven normal children were available for comparison. In this control group the mean ADC value of the normal white matter was 0.84 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. In tuberous sclerosis patients the mean ADC value of the white matter hamartomas (n = 20) was apparently high (1.52 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared with that of normal white matter. The ADC value of calcified hamartomas was "zero". The ADC value within a giant cell tumor was 0.89 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, similar to that of normal cerebral white matter. The ADC maps were superior to b = 1000 s/mm(2) (true diffusion) images with respect to lesion evaluation, and they provided mathematical information on tissue integrity. With respect to detection of the exact numbers and sizes of the parenchymal hamartomas fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were superior to ADC maps. It is believed that diffusion MRI can be useful in evaluation of various parenchymal changes associated with tuberous sclerosis. Further studies on tuberous sclerosis, and on various brain lesions, would provide increasing data on this relatively new MRI sequence.

N2  -  Decreased cerebral blood volume (CBV) in contralateral cerebellar gray matter (cGM) in conjunction with cerebellar white matter (cWM) damage, consistent with crossed cerebro-cerebellar diaschisis (cCCD) develop following supratentorial hemispheric stroke. In this study, we investigated the longitudinal evolution of diaschisis-related cerebellar perfusion and diffusion tensor-imaging (DTI) changes in patients after surgery for supratentorial brain tumors. Eight patients (M:F 5:3, age 8-22 years) who received surgery for supratentorial high-grade gliomas were evaluated. Initial MRI studies were performed 19-54 days postoperatively, with follow-ups at 2- to 3-month intervals. For each study, parametric maps of the cerebellum were generated and coregistered to T1-weighted images that had been previously segmented for cGM and cWM. Aggregate mean values of CBV, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained separately for cGM and cWM, and asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated. Hemodynamic changes were more robust in cGM than in cWM. Seven patients showed decreased perfusion within cGM contralateral to the supratentorial lesion on the first postoperative study, and asymmetry was significant for both CBV (p = 0.008) and CBF (p < 0.01). For CBV, follow-up studies showed a significant trend towards recovery (p < 0.02). DTI changes were more pronounced in cWM. FA values suggested a "paradoxical" increase at initial follow-up, but steadily declined thereafter (p = 0.0003), without evidence of subsequent recovery. Diaschisis-related hemodynamic alterations within cGM appear on early postoperative studies, but CBV recovers over time. Conversely, cWM DTI changes are delayed and progressive. Although the clinical correlates of cCCD are yet to be elucidated, better understanding of longitudinal structural and hemodynamic changes within brain remote from the area of primary insult could have implications in research and clinical rehabilitative strategies.

N2  -  Maximal safe resection is the modern goal for surgery of intrinsic brain tumors located in or close to brain eloquent areas. Nowadays different neuroimaging techniques provide important anatomical and functional information regarding the brain functional organization that can be used to plan a customized surgical strategy to preserve functional networks, and to increase the extent of tumor resection. Among these techniques, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) has recently gained great favor among the neurosurgical community for preoperative mapping and planning prior to brain tumor surgery. It represents an advanced neuroimaging technique based on the neurophysiological mapping of the functional cortical brain organization. Moreover, it can be combined with other neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging tractography, thus providing a reliable reconstruction of brain eloquent networks. Consequently, nTMS mapping may provide reliable noninvasive brain functional mapping, anticipating information that otherwise may be available to neurosurgeons only in the operating theater by using direct electrical stimulation. The authors describe the reliability and usefulness of the preoperative nTMS-based approach in neurosurgical practice, and briefly discuss their experience using nTMS as well as currently available evidence in the literature supporting its clinical use. In particular, special attention is reserved for the discussion of the role of nTMS as a novel tool for the preoperative neurophysiological mapping of motor and language networks prior to surgery of intrinsic brain tumors located in or close to eloquent networks, as well as for future and promising applications of nTMS in neurosurgical practice.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate the contribution of DWI and DTI to the differential diagnosis of cerebral ring enhancing lesions by describing DWI and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) findings and measuring the two DTI parameters mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA).
Materials and methods: A total of 17 patients presenting with 26 rim enhancing cysts were investigated with DWI and DTI. Parameter maps of the DTI metrics MD and FA were calculated and quantified using regions of interest (ROIs).; Results: Five patients suffered from abscesses with a total of 10 cysts, 9 from glioblastomas with 10 cysts, and 3 from metastases with 6 cysts. All abscess cavities showed hyperintense DWI signal intensity compared to normal appearing white matter (NAWM), low ADC, low MD and high FA. Eight out of 10 glioblastoma cysts and all 6 metastatic cysts revealed hypointensity on DWI, high ADC, high MD and low FA (p < 0.0001 compared to abscess group). DWI findings of 210 glioblastoma cysts overlapped with those of abscesses showing hyperintensity on DWI, low ADC and low MD and hence mimicked abscesses. FA of these 2 glioblastoma cysts was significantly lower than in abscess cavities (p = 0.032).; Conclusion: The findings of reduced diffusion compared to NAWM and increased FA within a ring enhancing cyst strongly indicate a cerebral abscess. In contrast, the majority of neoplastic cysts revealed high diffusion and low FA. Reduced diffusion is also found in a very small number of tumour cysts, but in these low FA refers to a non-infectious origin and thus helps distinguishing from infectious abscess.

N2  -  T1 relaxation and water mobility generate eloquent MRI tissue contrasts with great diagnostic value in many neuroradiological applications. However, conventional methods do not adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of these important biophysical properties within a voxel, and therefore have limited biological specificity. We describe a new correlation spectroscopic (CS) MRI method for measuring how T1 and mean diffusivity (MD) co-vary in microscopic tissue environments. We develop a clinical pulse sequence that combines inversion recovery (IR) with single-shot isotropic diffusion encoding (IDE) to efficiently acquire whole-brain MRIs with a wide range of joint T1-MD weightings. Unlike conventional diffusion encoding, the IDE preparation ensures that all subvoxel water pools are weighted by their MDs regardless of the sizes, shapes, and orientations of their corresponding microscopic diffusion tensors. Accordingly, IR-IDE measurements are well-suited for model-free, quantitative spectroscopic analysis of microscopic water pools. Using numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and data from healthy volunteers we demonstrate how IR-IDE MRIs can be processed to reconstruct maps of two-dimensional joint probability density functions, i.e., correlation spectra, of subvoxel T1-MD values. In vivo T1-MD spectra show distinct cerebrospinal fluid and parenchymal tissue components specific to white matter, cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, and myelinated fiber pathways, suggesting the potential for improved biological specificity. The one-dimensional marginal distributions derived from the T1-MD correlation spectra agree well with results from other relaxation spectroscopic and quantitative MRI studies, validating the T1-MD contrast encoding and the spectral reconstruction. Mapping subvoxel T1-diffusion correlations in patient populations may provide a more nuanced, comprehensive, sensitive, and specific neuroradiological assessment of the non-specific changes seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted MRIs (DWIs) in cancer, ischemic stroke, or brain injury.

N2  -  The authors report a case of severe hypoglycemic encephalopathy in an elderly patient. The magnetic resonance images showed bilateral cortical signal changes and basal ganglia lesions, which spared the thalami. The lesions were bright on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted images and dark on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, being more conspicuous on the diffusion-weighted images than on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. A literature review of the imaging features and pathophysiological mechanism in comparison with those of hypoxic ischemic injury is discussed.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - We investigated whether transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs) before stroke can induce tolerance by raising the threshold of tissue vulnerability in the human brain.
Methods - Sixty-five patients with first-ever ischemic territorial stroke received diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI within 12 hours of symptom onset. Epidemiological and clinical data, lesion volumes in T2, apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) maps and perfusion maps, and cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume values were compared between patients with and without a prodromal TIA.; Results - Despite similar size and severity of the perfusion deficit, initial diffusion lesions tended to be smaller and final infarct volumes were significantly reduced ( final T2: 9.1 interquartile range, 19.7 versus 36.5 91.2 mL; P = 0.014) in patients with a history of TIA ( n = 16). This was associated with milder clinical deficits.; Conclusions - The beneficial effect of TIAs on lesion size in ADC and T2 suggests the existence of endogenous neuroprotection in the human brain.

N2  -  Pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance in neurosurgery require detailed information about the location of functional areas and their anatomo-functional connectivity. In particular, regarding the language system, post-operative deficits such as aphasia can be avoided. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, the connectivity between functional areas can be reconstructed by tractography techniques that need to cope with limitations such as limited resolution and low anisotropic diffusion close to functional areas. Tumors pose particular challenges because of edema, displacement effects on brain tissue and infiltration of white matter. Under these conditions, standard fiber tracking methods reconstruct pathways of insufficient quality. Therefore, robust global or probabilistic approaches are required. In this study, two commonly used standard fiber tracking algorithms, streamline propagation and tensor deflection, were compared with a previously published global search, Gibbs tracking and a connection-oriented probabilistic tractography approach. All methods were applied to reconstruct neuronal pathways of the language system of patients undergoing brain tumor surgery, and control subjects. Connections between Broca and Wernicke areas via the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) were validated by a clinical expert to ensure anatomical feasibility, and compared using distance-and diffusion-based similarity metrics to evaluate their agreement on pathway locations. For both patients and controls, a strong agreement between all methods was observed regarding the location of the AF. In case of the IFOF however, standard fiber tracking and Gibbs tracking predominantly identified the inferior longitudinal fasciculus that plays a secondary role in semantic language processing. In contrast, global search resolved connections in almost every case via the IFOF which could be confirmed by probabilistic fiber tracking. The results show that regarding the language system, our global search is superior to clinically applied conventional fiber tracking strategies with results similar to time-consuming global or probabilistic approaches.

N2  -  Background: The quantification of diffusion conditions in normal human brain has been gaining more and more attention since diffusion weighed imaging (DWI) was proved to be an important tool in the evaluation of cerebral pathologies, especially regarding the diagnosis of hyperacute stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and anisotrophy index (Al) in normal human brain to evaluate physiological ADC values for an ADC mapping of different brain regions.
MaterialsMethods: 22 regions of interest (ROIs) in the ADC maps of 53 volunteers showing no cerebral pathologies were measured in the gray and white matter of the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes, the corpus callosum, and the lateral ventricles.; Results: Apparent diffusion is quite inhomogeneous for different brain regions. In both subcortical white matter (ADC: 525 x 10(-8) mm(2)s, AI: 0.05) and in gray matter (ADC: 1486 x 10(-8) mm(2)s, AI: 0.05) diffusion was isotropic, while in periventricular white matter (ADC: 408 x 10(-8) mm(2)s, AI: 0.34) and the corpus callosum (ADC: 799 x 10(-8) mm(2)s, AI: 0.77) anisotropic.; Conclusions: With the exception of children and young adults, ADC seems to be intra- and interindividually constant, with no sex or age dependency for the patient sample we investigated (mean age: 62 +- 9.4 years). Hence the measurement of ADC may provide an index of lesion severity.

N2  -  Introduction. Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy is a clinico-radiological syndrome first described in the last decade. The physiopathological mechanism governing it is not very well known. The currently accepted hypotheses are the generation of a vasogenic edema caused by failure of the mechanism that allows self-regulation of the cerebral bloodflow, and the production of a cytotoxic edema due to ischemia. Both experimental studies carried out in rats and the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the diffusion of cerebral water support the first hypothesis. We report the case of a patient with reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome that was complicated by areas of cerebral infarction and we review the physiopathological mechanisms involved, basing our analysis on the findings obtained with MRL Case report. A female patient was admitted to our hospital because of bilateral transient amaurosis, headaches, vomiting and arterial hypertension. MRI brain scans showed bilateral cortico-subcortical lesions in the occipital-parietal regions, frontal and right cerebellar hemisphere convexity, with hyperintense signal in T-2 and diffusion-weighted imaging. Some occipital-parietal regions present a diminished signal on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. The patient was treated with intravenous antiltypertensive drugs and full recovery was accomplished within 10 days. A month later according to MRI scans, there were still hyperintense areas in T2 on both occipital lobes, which were compatible with cerebral infarcts. Conclusion. The mechanism that is most frequently involved in this entity is probably vasogenic edema. In our case there were, at the same time, areas of cytotoxic edema that progressed to cerebral infarcts. MRI with sequences that evaluate the diffusion of cerebral water is useful in distinguishing between the two mechanisms.

N2  -  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences and correlative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps is a very sensitive way to detect acute ischemic stroke. Cases of negative MRI-DWI on acute phase of ischemic stroke are uncommon, and most of them are reported in single small-sized lesions, which in most cases are below the technical spatial resolution and in patients imaged shortly after the symptoms start. The few published cases of territorial ischemic stroke with negative DWI affect exclusively one vascular territory. We report the case of an ischemic stroke involving 2 different arteries of the posterior circulation, with a negative DWI/ADC brain MRI 18 hours after time-last-seen-well. We also suggest a possible explanation regarding the mechanism of false-negative diffusion MRI on ischemic stroke. (C) 2015 by National Stroke Association

N2  -  Brainstem, which connects the distal part of the brain and the spinal cord, contains main motor and sensory nerves and facilitates communication between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Due to the complicated anatomy and neurostructure of brainstem, surgical interventions to resect brainstem tumors are particularly challenging, and new approaches to reduce the risk of surgical brain injury are of utmost importance. Although previous studies have investigated the structural anisotropy of brain white matter, the effect of axonal fibers on the mechanical properties of white matter has not yet been fully understood. The current study aims to compare the effect of axonal orientation on changes in material properties of brainstem under large deformations and failure through a novel approach. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on ex-vivo bovine brains, we determined the orientation of axons in brainstem. We extracted brainstem samples in two orthogonal directions, parallel and perpendicular to the axons, and subjected to uniaxial tension to reach the failure at loading rates of 50 mm/min and 150 mm/min. The results showed that the tearing energy and failure strain of samples with axons parallel to the force direction were approximately 1.5 times higher than the samples with axons perpendicular to the force direction. The results also revealed that as the sample's initial length increases, its failure strain decreases. These results emphasize the importance of the axon orientation in the mechanical properties of brainstem, and suggest that considering the directional-dependent behavior for this tissue could help to propose new surgical interventions for reducing the risk of injury during tumor resection.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides a reliable identification of "eloquent" cortical brain areas. Moreover, it can be used for diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking of eloquent subcortical tracts. We describe the use of nTMS-based cortical mapping and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking for defining the "eloquence" of areas surrounding brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs), aiming to improve patient stratification and treatment.
METHODS: We collected data of BAVMs suspected to be in eloquent areas treated between 2017 and 2019, and submitted to nTMS-based reconstruction of motor, language, and visual pathways for the definition of the eloquence of the surrounding brain areas. We describe the nTMS-based approach and analyze its impact on patient stratification and allocation to treatment in comparison with the standard assessment of eloquence based on anatomical landmarks.; RESULTS: Ten patients were included in the study. Preliminarily, 9 BAVMs were suspected to be located in an eloquent area. After nTMS-based mapping, only 5 BAVMs were confirmed to he close to eloquent structures, thus leading to a change of the score for eloquence and of the final BAVMs grading in 60% of patients. Treatment was customized according to nTMS information, and no cases of neurological worsening were observed. Radiological obliteration was complete in 7 cases microsurgically treated, and accounted for about 70% in the remaining 3 patients 1 year after radiosurgical treatment.; CONCLUSIONS: The nTMS-based information allows an accurate stratification and allocation of patients with BAVMs to the most effective treatment according to a modern, customized, neurophysiological identification of the adjacent eloquent brain networks.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence and distribution of direct brain injury caused by acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAN) by the use of magnetic resonance imaging.
METHODS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), were performed in 32 patients with SAH by use of a 1.5-T whole-body superconductive scanner equipped with an echo planar imaging system. In all cases, computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at the time of admission, before angiography and surgical intervention.; RESULTS: No abnormalities were revealed by DWI in any of the low-grade SAH patients. However, five (71%) of seven patients diagnosed as having poor-grade SAH (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grades 4 and 5) displayed multiple, patchy focal abnormalities on DWI. Computed tomographic scans obtained at admission failed to clearly demonstrate all of the damaged areas of the brain that were visualized by DWI. These lesions were located in supratentorial cerebral parenchyma, but not in the thalamus, basal ganglia, or cerebellar hemisphere. These multiple widespread lesions exhibiting laminar involvement of the cerebral cortex were not associated with the site of the ruptured aneurysm.; CONCLUSION: DWI revealed widespread multifocal lesions in the cerebral cortex of acute poor-grade SAH patients. DWI provides accurate images of all areas of brain damage directly attributable to SAH.

N2  -  This study aimed to quantitatively analyze data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in patients with brain disorders and to assess its potential utility for analyzing brain function. DTI was obtained by performing 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), and the data were analyzed using Matlab-based SPM software. The two-sample t-test was used for error analysis of the location of the activated pixels. We compared regions of white matter where the fractional anisotropy (FA) values were low and the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were increased. In the AD group, the FA values were low in the right superior temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right sub-lobar insula, and right occipital lingual gyrus whereas the ADCs were significantly increased in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus. In the VD group, the FA values were low in the right superior temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right limbic cingulate gyrus, and right sub-lobar caudate tail whereas the ADCs were significantly increased in the left lateral globus pallidus and left medial globus pallidus. In conclusion by using DTI and SPM analysis, we were able to not only determine the structural state of the regions affected by brain disorders but also quantitatively analyze and assess brain function.

N2  -  The corticospinal tract (CST) is one of the most well studied tracts in human neuroanatomy. Its clinical significance can be demonstrated in many notable traumatic conditions and diseases such as stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). With the advent of diffusion MRI and tractography the computational representation of the human CST in a 3D model became available. However, the representation of the entire CST and, specifically, the hand motor area has remained elusive. In this paper we propose a novel method, using manually drawn ROIs based on robustly identifiable neuroanatomic structures to delineate the entire CST and isolate its hand motor representation as well as to estimate their variability and generate a database of their volume, length and biophysical parameters. Using 37 healthy human subjects we performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the CST and the hand-related motor fiber tracts (HMFTs). Finally, we have created variability heat maps from 37 subjects for both the aforementioned tracts, which could be utilized as a reference for future studies with clinical focus to explore neuropathology in both trauma and disease states.

N2  -  Recent advances in MRI methodology, such as microvascular and brain oxygenation (StO(2)) imaging, may prove useful in obtaining information about the severity of the acute stroke. We assessed the potential of StO(2) to detect the ischaemic core in the acute phase compared to apparent diffusion coefficient and to predict the final necrosis. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=38) were imaged during acute stroke (D0) and 21 days after (D21). A multiparametric MRI protocol was performed at 4.7T to characterize brain damage within three region of interest: LesionD0' (diffusion), Mismatch' representing penumbra (perfusion/diffusion) and Hypoxia' (voxels<40% of StO(2) within the region of interest LesionD0). Voxel-based analysis of stroke revealed heterogeneity of the region of interest LesionD0, which included voxels with different degrees of oxygenation decrease. This finding was supported by a dramatic decrease of vascular and perfusion parameters within the region of interest hypoxia. This zone presented the lowest values of almost all parameters analysed, indicating a higher severity. Our study demonstrates the potential of StO(2) magnetic resonance imaging to more accurately detect the ischaemic core without the inclusion of any reversible ischaemic damage. Our follow-up study indicates that apparent diffusion coefficient imaging overestimated the final necrosis while StO(2) imaging did not.

N2  -  Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a serious neurological disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. We report a case of atypical and extensive location of abnormal signal lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a man with alcohol abuse with WE. MRI performed on the first hospital day showed signal intensity alterations extending in the whole brain stem and diencephalon; the mismatch between diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient map was highly suggestive of vasogenic edema. This report further supports the view that WE may represent a spectrum of radiological entities and can have a wide spectrum of manifestations on MRI; thus, clinical features are essential to diagnose it.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is the imaging technique used in vivo to visualise white matter pathways. The cortico-spinal tract (CST) belongs to one of the most often delineated tracts preoperatively, although the optimal DTI method has not been established yet. Considering that various regions of interests (ROIs) could be selected, the reproducibility of CST tracking among different centres is low. We aimed to select the most reliable tractography method for outlining the CST for neurosurgeons.
Materials and methods: Our prospective study consisted of 32 patients (11 males, 21 females) with a brain tumour of various locations. DTI and T1-weighed image series were acquired prior to the surgery. To draw the CST, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and the cerebral peduncle (CP) were defined as two main ROIs. Together with these main ROIs, another four cortical endpoints were selected: the frontal lobe (FL), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the precentral gyrus (PCG) and the postcentral gyrus (POCG). Based on these ROIs, we composed ten virtual CSTs in DSI Studio. The fractional anisotropy, the mean diffusivity, the tracts' volume, the length and the number were compared between all the CSTs. The degree of the CST infiltration, tumour size, the patients' sex and age were examined.; Results: Significant differences in the number of tracts and their volume were observed when the PLIC or the CP stood as a single ROI comparing with the two-ROI method (all p < 0.05). The mean CST volume was 40054U (SD +- 12874) and the number of fibres was 259.3 (SD +- 87.3) when the PLIC was a single ROI. When the CP was a single ROI, almost a half of fibres (147.6; SD +- 64.0) and half of the CST volume (26664U; SD +- 10059U) was obtained (all p < 0.05). There were no differences between the various CSTs in terms of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, the apparent diffusion coefficient, radial diffusivity and the tract length (p > 0.05). The CST was infiltrated by a growing tumour or oedema in 17 of 32 patients; in these cases, the mean and apparent diffusion of the infiltrated CST was significantly higher than in uncompromised CSTs (p = 0.04). CST infiltration did not alter the other analysed parameters (all p > 0.05).; Conclusions: A universal method of DTI of the CST was not developed. However, we found that the CP or the PLIC (with or without FL as the second ROI) should be used to outline the CST.

N2  -  The a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) method was developed to study heterogeneous water diffusion in the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An advantage of this model is that it does not require an assumption about the shape of the intravoxel distribution of apparent diffusion rates, and it has a calculable relationship to this distribution. The alpha-DWI technique is useful for detecting microstructural tissue changes associated with brain tumor invasion, and may be useful for directing therapy to invading tumor cells. In previous work, a-DWI was performed with magnetic field gradients applied along a single direction in order to avoid artificially introducing a source of heterogeneity to the decay. However, it is known that restricted diffusion is anisotropic in the brain, and the a-DWI method must take this into account to be complete. In this work the relationship between the applied magnetic field gradients and the fitted stretched-exponential model parameters was studied in the human brain. It was found the distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) varies with the direction of applied gradients, while the heterogeneity index a is relatively direction-insensitive. It is proposed that in clinical use, maps of a can be created using diffusion-weighting gradients applied in a single direction that reflect the tissue heterogeneity.

N2  -  Our purpose was to use whole brain echo planar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify and characterize diffusion abnormalities in acute cerebral ischemia. We studied 40 patients as early as 3 hours after onset of signs and symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the entire brain could be completed in 3 seconds or, using seven different diffusion sensitivities (maximum b 1,271 sec/mm(2)), in 48 seconds. Measurements and synthetic maps were made of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), a physiological parameter that characterizes the self-diffusion of water in tissue, Early ischemic lesions were identified with DWI as hyperintense regions of decreased ADC in all patients who subsequently developed infarction, before changes were evident on conventional MRI in cases studied earlier than 6 hours after onset of ischemic symptoms, Lesions as small as 4 mm in diameter were identified. The extent of lesions within white matter was best defined by controlling for the anisotropic effect of axonal orientation. The mean ADC (+/- SD) for control regions in the 36 patients was 9.15 (+/- 2.91) x 10(-4) mm(2)/sec. Mean ADC of ischemic regions was 56% of control values at 6 hours or less and stayed significantly reduced for 3 to 4 days after onset of ischemia. The relative ADC increased progressively over time to be pseudonormalized at 5 to 10 days and elevated in the chronic state, making the distinction of acute lesions adjacent to chronic infarcts readily apparent. DWI with echo planar imaging measures a unique physiological parameter that is sensitive to ischemic changes before conventional MRI. Its potential role in the quantitative study of human stroke pathophysiology and therapeutics is the subject of further investigation.

N2  -  Purpose: To demonstrate the capability of the fractional motion (FM) model for describing anomalous diffusion in cerebral gliomas and to assess the potential feasibility of FM for grading these tumors.
Methods: Diffusion MRI images were acquired from brain tumor patients using a special Stejskal-Tanner diffusion sequence with variable diffusion gradient amplitudes and separation times. Patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas, including astrocytic and oligoastrocytic tumors, were selected. The FM-related parameters, including the Noah exponent (a), the Hurst exponent (H), and the memory parameter (mu = H - 1alpha), were calculated and compared between low-and high-grade gliomas using a two-sample t-test. The grading performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis.; Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the present study. The calculated a, H, and m permitted the separation of tumor lesions from surrounding normal tissues in parameter maps and helped differentiate glioma grades. Moreover, a showed greater sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing low-and high-grade gliomas compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient.; Conclusion: The FM model could improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating low-and high-grade gliomas. This improved diffusion model may facilitate future studies of neuropathological changes in clinical populations. (C) 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

N2  -  Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) technique offers an effective tool to diminish partial-volume averaging effects from cerebrospinal (CSF) signal with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. CSF-suppressed and unsuppressed direction-dependent diffusion-weighted (DW) images are obtained with a DW spin-echo EPI sequence in a single acquisition scheme. Comparison of unsuppressed and CSF-suppressed apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps yields consistent values for brain tissue in volunteers when no partial-volume effects are expected, but differs considerably at borders of parenchyma to ventricles and sulci. From theory and phantom studies, a corrected anisotropy index is introduced considering differences of statistical fit errors. Anisotropy of white matter is observed in normal brain of volunteers. Anisotropy index maps reveal destruction of fiber tracts in pathologic areas, Results of a preliminary study on 12 patients with intra-axial tumors indicate an improved delineation of tumor boundaries of FLAIR ADC maps against unsuppressed acquisition.

N2  -  Background
MR Tractography enables non-invasive preoperative depiction of language subcortical tracts, which is crucial for the presurgical work-up of brain tumors; however, it cannot evaluate the exact function of the fibers.; Purpose; A systematic pipeline was developed to combine tractography reconstruction of language fiber bundles, based on anatomical landmarks (Anatomical-T), with language fMRI cortical activations. A fMRI-targeted Tractography (fMRI-T) was thus obtained, depicting the subsets of the anatomical tracts whose endpoints are located inside a fMRI activation. We hypothesized that fMRI-T could provide additional functional information regarding the subcortical structures, better reflecting the eloquent white matter structures identified intraoperatively.; Methods; Both Anatomical-T and fMRI-T of language fiber tracts were performed on 16 controls and preoperatively on 16 patients with left-hemisphere brain tumors, using a q-ball residual bootstrap algorithm based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) datasets (b = 3000 smm(2); 60 directions); fMRI ROIs were obtained using picture naming, verbal fluency, and auditory verb generation tasks. In healthy controls, normalized MNI atlases of fMRI-T and Anatomical-T were obtained. In patients, the surgical resection of the tumor was pursued by identifying eloquent structures with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation mapping and extending surgery to the functional boundaries. Post-surgical MRI allowed to identify Anatomical-T and fMRI-T non-eloquent portions removed during the procedure.; Results; MNI Atlases showed that fMRI-T is a subset of Anatomical-T, and that different task-specific fMRI-T involve both shared subsets and task-specific subsets - e.g., verbal fluency fMRI-T strongly involves dorsal frontal tracts, consistently with the phonogical-articulatory features of this task. A quantitative analysis in patients revealed that Anatomical-T removed portions of AF-SLF and IFOF were significantly greater than verbal fluency fMRI-T ones, suggesting that fMRI-T is a more specific approach. In addition, qualitative analyses showed that fMRI-T AF-SLF and IFOF predict the exact functional limits of resection with increased specificity when compared to Anatomical-T counterparts, especially the superior frontal portion of IFOF, in a subcohort of patients.; Conclusion; These results suggest that performing fMRI-T in addition to the 'classic' Anatomical-T may be useful in a preoperative setting to identify the 'high-risk subsets' that should be spared during the surgical procedure.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficiency (ADC) in distinguishing brain abscesses from cystic or necrotic brain tumors, which are difficult to be differentiated by conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques.
Methods : Seven patients with brain abscesses and ten patients with cystic brain tumors were studied from September 2003 to October 2005. Abscess, subdural empyema and ventriculitis were categorized to the abscess group and cystic or necrotic brain gliomas or metastatic brain tumors into the tumor group. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were perfomed in all patients and diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficiency values of lesions were calculated directly from software of 1.5 testa MRI (General Electrics, USA). The ratio of the ADC of the lesion to contralateral regional ADC was also measured (relative ADC, rADC).; Results : The average ADC value of pyogenic abscesses group was 0.82+-0.14 X 10(-3) (mean+-S.D.) mm(2)s and mean rADC was 0.75. Cystic or necrotic areas had high ADC values (2.49+-0.79X 10(-3) mm(2)s, mean rADC=2.14). ADC and rADC values of abscesses group showed about three times lower values than those of cystic or necrotic tumor group.; Conclusion : This study results based on numerical comparison of signal intensities and quantitative analysis to distinguish between brain abscess and cystic or necrotic tumor, DWI and ADC mapping are thought to be very useful diagnostic toots.

N2  -  Because of the increasing incidence of cerebral lymphoma, it is critical for patient management to recognize the MR features of this disease. We present the characteristic morphological and functional MRI features of this tumor. The findings on MRI studies, including morphological, diffusion and perfusion imaging, performed in 9 biopsy-proven cases of cerebral lymphoma with 13 lesions are presented and analyzed, and are discussed in comparison with published literature data. A 11 patients underwent diffusion-weighted imaging with a single shot echo-planar pulse sequence. Dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI was performed using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar sequence after intravenous injection of chelates of gadolinium at the rate of 6 ml/s and a temporal resolution of 1 second.
All cases of cerebral lymphoma appeared hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted images and in 75% of cases iso- or hypointense on T2-weighted images. All lesions enhanced except one in a patient receiving steroid therapy. On diffusion-weighted images, tumours were hyperintense with normal or decreased A DC values (0.717 +- 0.152.10(-3) mm(2)sec, range: 0.550-1.014) and an ADC ratio tumourhormal white matter of 0.974 +- 0.190 (range: 0.768-1.410). On perfusion, the signal intensity-time curve of each tumour showed a characteristic type of curve with a significant increase of the signal intensity above the baseline and a low maximum relative cerebral blood volume ratio (rCVBmax) of 1.43 +- 0.64 (0.55-2.62).; Due to their higher cellularity, the lack of neoangiogenesis, and the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier related to the infiltration of blood vessels wall by lymphomatous cells, cerebral lymphoma presents characteristic diffusion and perfusion MRI features that should be useful for diagnosis and patient follow-up.

N2  -  Subcortical white matter injury is often accompanied by orofacial motor dysfunction, but little is known about the structural substrates accounting for these common neurological deficits. We studied the trajectory of the corticobulbar projection from the orofacial region of the primary (M1), ventrolateral (LPMCv), supplementary (M2), rostral cingulate (M3) and caudal cingulate (M4) motor regions through the corona radiata (CR), internal capsule (IC) and crus cerebri of the cerebral peduncle (ccCP). In the CR each pathway was segregated. Medial motor area fibers (M2/M3/M4) arched over the caudate and lateral motor area fibers (M1/LPMCv) curved over the putamen. At superior IC levels, the pathways were widespread, involving the anterior limb, genu and posterior limb with the M3 projection located anteriorly, followed posteriorly by projections from M2, LPMCv, M4 and M1, respectively. Inferiorly, all pathways maintained this orientation but shifted posteriorly, with adjacent fiber bundles overlapping minimally. In the ccCP, M3 fibers were located medially and M1 fibers centromedially, with M2, LPMCv, and M4 pathways overlapping in between. Finally, at inferior ccCP levels, all pathways overlapped. Following CR and superior IC lesions, the dispersed pathway distribution may correlate with acute orofacial dysfunction with spared pathways contributing to orofacial motor recovery. In contrast, the gradually commixed nature of pathway representation inferiorly may enhance fiber vulnerability and correlate with severe, prolonged deficits following lower subcortical and midbrain injury. Additionally, in humans these findings may assist in interpreting orofacial movements evoked during deep brain stimulation, and neuroimaging tractography efforts to localize descending orofacial motor pathways.

N2  -  Background Diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is usually achieved by digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, while structural brain tissue damage can be assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging (PWI, DWI) we aimed in this study to identify pathophysiological patterns corresponding to only functional and hence reversible tissue involvement. Methods PWI, DWI, and conventional MRI were performed in six CVT patients acutely and after 16-26 days when their clinical condition had improved. All patients were treated with partial thromboplastin time-effective intravenous heparin. After intravenous administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent, bolus track PWI allows pixel based determination of mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). DWI was performed with two different b values (0, 1000 s/mm(2)) for calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Results in five of six cases increased MTT values were observed initially, whereas the CBV was normal, indicating a reduction of cerebral blood flow. ADC values were normal. On follow up after clinical recovery MTT prolongations had resolved. Areas with prolonged MTT did not evolve into structural lesions. Conclusion In patients with CVT, prolongations of MTT in the absence of changes in CBV and ADC seem to indicate reversible involvement of brain tissue, a situation corresponding to the ischaemic penumbra.

N2  -  White matter (WM) mapping of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques has gained considerable interest in the neuroscience community. Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), WM fiber pathways between brain regions may be systematically assessed to make inferences concerning their role in normal brain function, influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which has proved important to and controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the WM damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a "tamping iron'' was accidentally shot through his skull and brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have not previously been considered in detail. Using computed tomography (CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction with modern anatomical MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25-36), we computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter (GM) and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the impact on measures of network connectedness between directly affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's WM network may not have been more severe than expected from that of a similarly sized "average'' brain lesion. These results provide new insight into the remarkable brain injury experienced by this noteworthy patient.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Current standard of care for children with infratentorial ependymoma includes maximal safe resection and local radiation of 54-59 Gray. High-dose local radiation has been associated with declines in multiple cognitive domains. The anatomic and physiologic correlates of this cognitive decline remain undefined, and there have been no radiographic studies on the long-term effects of this treatment paradigm.
METHODS: A comprehensive database of pediatric brain tumor patients treated at Stanford Children's from 2004-2016 was queried. Seven patients with posterior fossa ependymoma who were treated with surgery and local radiation alone, who had no evidence of recurrent disease, and had imaging suitable for analysis were identified. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging datasets were used to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient maps for each subject, while arterial spin labeling datasets were used to calculate maps of cerebral blood flow. Diffusion-weighted imaging and arterial spin labeling datasets of 52 age-matched healthy children were analyzed in the same fashion to enable group comparisons.; RESULTS: Several statistically significant differences were detected between the 2 groups. Cerebral blood flow was lower in the caudate and pallidum and higher in the nucleus accumbens in the ependymoma cohort compared with controls. Apparent diffusion coefficient was increased in the thalamus and trended toward decreased in the amygdala.; CONCLUSIONS: Surgery and local radiation for posterior fossa ependymoma are associated with supratentorial apparent diffusion coefficient and cerebral blood flow alterations, which may represent an anatomic and physiologic correlate to the previously published decline in neurocognitive outcomes in this population.

N2  -  Susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) is a recently developed MRI technique that allows quantitative determination of orientation-independent magnetic susceptibility parameters from the dependence of gradient echo signal phase on the orientation of biological tissues with respect to the main magnetic field. By modeling the magnetic susceptibility of each voxel as a symmetric rank-2 tensor, individual magnetic susceptibility tensor elements as well as the mean magnetic susceptibility and magnetic susceptibility anisotropy can be determined for brain tissues that would still show orientation dependence after conventional scalar-based quantitative susceptibility mapping to remove such dependence. Similar to diffusion tensor imaging, STI allows mapping of brain white matter fiber orientations and reconstruction of 3D white matter pathways using the principal eigenvectors of the susceptibility tensor. In contrast to diffusion anisotropy, the main determinant factor of the susceptibility anisotropy in brain white matter is myelin. Another unique feature of the susceptibility anisotropy of white matter is its sensitivity to gadolinium-based contrast agents. Mechanistically, MRI-observed susceptibility anisotropy is mainly attributed to the highly ordered lipid molecules in the myelin sheath. STI provides a consistent interpretation of the dependence of phase and susceptibility on orientation at multiple scales. This article reviews the key experimental findings and physical theories that led to the development of STI, its practical implementations, and its applications for brain research.

N2  -  Left visual neglect is a dramatic neurological condition that impairs awareness of left-sided events. Neglect has been classically reported after strokes in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. However, the precise lesional correlates of neglect within this territory remain discussed. Recent evidence strongly suggests an implication of dysfunction of large-scale perisylvian networks in chronic neglect, but the quantitative relationships between neglect signs and damage to white matter (WM) tracts have never been explored. In this prospective study, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in twelve patients with a vascular stroke in the right hemisphere. Six of these patients showed signs of neglect. Nonparametric voxel-based comparisons between neglect and controls on fractional anisotropy maps revealed clusters in the perisylvian WM and in the external capsule. Individual DTI tractography identified specific disconnections of the fronto-parietal and fronto-occipital pathways in the neglect group. Voxel-based correlation statistics highlighted correlations between patients' performance on two visual search tasks and damage to WM clusters. These clusters were located in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and in the WM underlying the inferior frontal gyrus, along the trajectory of the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus (asAF). These results indicate that chronic visual neglect can result from, and correlate with, damage to fronto-parietal connections in the right hemisphere, within large-scale cortical networks important for orienting of spatial attention, arousal and spatial working memory.

N2  -  Noninvasive mapping of cellular pathology can provide critical diagnostic and prognostic information. Recent advances in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging enabled in vivo examination of tissue microstructures well beyond the imaging resolution. Here, we proposed to use diffusion time-dependent diffusion kurtosis imaging (tDKI) to simultaneously assess cellular morphology and transmembrane permeability in hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Through numerical simulations and organoid imaging, we demonstrated the feasibility of capturing effective size and permeability changes using tDKI. In vivo MRI of HI-injured mouse brains detected a shift of the tDKI peak to longer diffusion times, suggesting swelling of the cellular processes. Furthermore, we observed a faster decrease of the tDKI tail, reflecting increased transmembrane permeability associated with up-regulated water exchange or necrosis. Such information, unavailable from a single diffusion time, can predict salvageable tissues. Preliminary applications of tDKI in patients with ischemic stroke suggested increased transmembrane permeability in stroke regions, illustrating tDKI's potential for detecting pathological changes in the clinics.

N2  -  OBJECT The deep frontal pathway connecting the superior frontal gyrus to Broca's area, recently named the frontal aslant tract (FAT), is assumed to be associated with language functions, especially speech initiation and spontaneity. Injury to the deep frontal lobe is known to cause aphasia that mimics the aphasia caused by damage to the supplementary motor area. Although fiber dissection and tractography have revealed the existence of the tract, little is known about its function. The aim of this study was to determine the function of the FAT via electrical stimulation in patients with glioma who underwent awake surgery.
METHODS The authors analyzed the data from subcortical mapping with electrical stimulation in 5 consecutive cases (3 males and 2 females, age range 40-54 years) with gliomas in the left frontal lobe. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the FAT were performed in all cases. A navigation system and intraoperative MRI were used in all cases. During the awake phase of the surgery, cortical mapping was performed to find the precentral gyrus and Broca's area, followed by tumor resection. After the cortical layer was removed, subcortical mapping was performed to assess. language-associated fibers in the white matter.; RESULTS In all 5 cases, positive responses were obtained at the stimulation sites in the subcortical area adjacent to the FAT, which was visualized by the navigation system. Speech arrest was observed in 4 cases, and remarkably slow speech and conversation was observed in 1 case. The location of these sites was also determined on intraoperative MR images and estimated on preoperative MR images with DTI tractography, confirming the spatial relationships among the stimulation sites and white matter tracts. Tumor removal was successfully performed-without damage to this tract, and language function did not deteriorate in any of the cases postoperatively.; CONCLUSIONS The authors identified the left FAT and confirmed that it was associated with language functions. This tract should be recognized by clinicians to preserve language function during brain tumor surgery, especially for tumors located in the deep frontal lobe on the language-dominant side.

N2  -  In diffusion MRI (dMRI), microscopic diffusion anisotropy can be obscured by orientation dispersion. Separation of these properties is of high importance, since it could allow dMRI to non-invasively probe elongated structures such as neurites (axons and dendrites). However, conventional dMRI, based on single diffusion encoding (SDE), entangles microscopic anisotropy and orientation dispersion with intra-voxel variance in isotropic diffusivity. SDE-based methods for estimating microscopic anisotropy, such as the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) method, must thus rely on model assumptions to disentangle these features. An alternative approach is to directly quantify microscopic anisotropy by the use of variable shape of the b-tensor. Along those lines, we here present the 'constrained diffusional variance decomposition' (CODIVIDE) method, which jointly analyzes data acquired with diffusion encoding applied in a single direction at a time (linear tensor encoding, LTE) and in all directions (spherical tensor encoding, STE). We then contrast the two approaches by comparing neurite density estimated using NODDI with microscopic anisotropy estimated using CODIVIDE. Data were acquired in healthy volunteers and in glioma patients. NODDI and CODIVIDE differed the most in gray matter and in gliomas, where NODDI detected a neurite fraction higher than expected from the level of microscopic diffusion anisotropy found with CODIVIDE. The discrepancies could be explained by the NODDI tortuosity assumption, which enforces a connection between the neurite density and the mean diffusivity of tissue. Our results suggest that this assumption is invalid, which leads to a NODDI neurite density that is inconsistent between LTE and STE data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the NODDI assumptions result in parameter bias that precludes the use of NODDI to map neurite density. With CODIVIDE, we found high levels of microscopic anisotropy in white matter, intermediate levels in structures such as the thalamus and the putamen, and low levels in the cortex and in gliomas. We conclude that accurate mapping of microscopic anisotropy requires data acquired with variable shape of the b-tensor.

N2  -  The combination of high signal and reduced apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) within abscesses on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has been reported as characteristic of abscesses, and useful for distinguishing them from cystic or necrotic neoplasms. To assess whether these are consistent findings in abscesses, we used DWI-derived ADC to investigate changes in water diffusibility in cerebral abscesses. We reviewed the MRI studies and clinical records of five patients with brain abscesses, who underwent DWI. Regions of interest were drawn within the abscesses on ADC maps, to obtain the ADC. The center of all five abscesses gave signal higher than that of white matter on DWI. The three largest also appeared bright on ADC maps, i.e., showed ADC substantially lower than those of normal white matter, consistent with restricted diffusion. However, the two smaller abscesses were not visible on ADC maps because their ADC were essentially the same as that of white matter; they did not show restricted diffusion. The absence of restricted diffusion within small abscesses may be related to intrinsic differences in molecular microenvironment between small and large abscesses, or to greater influence of volume averaging with surrounding edema on the ADC in smaller abscesses.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The various stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by de- and remyelination as well as by inflammation, Diffusion MR imaging is sensitive to tissue water motion, which might correspond to these pathologic processes. Our purpose was to demonstrate differences in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor anisotropy in acute and chronic MS plaques and in normal-appearing brain.
METHODS: Twelve MS patients underwent conventional and full-tenser diffusion MR imaging with B = 1221 smm(2). Derivation of trace ADC and calculation of anisotropic scalars, including eccentricity, relative anisotropy (RA), and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed on a per-pixel basis. Regions of interest of plaques and normal structures were determined on coregistered maps. MS lesions were classified as acute, subacute, or chronic on the basis of their appearance on conventional images and in relation to clinical findings.; RESULTS: Seven patients had acute plaques with a concentric arrangement of alternating high and low signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images, In nine acute lesions, plaque centers had high ADC with reduced anisotropy compared with rim, normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and chronic lesions. The thin rim of diffusion-weighted hyperintensity surrounding the center showed variable ADC and anisotropic values, which were not statistically different from NAWM. Subacute and chronic MS lesions had intermediate ADC elevationsanisotropic reductions, Calculated FA pixel maps were superior to eccentricity or RA maps; however, quality was limited by signal-to-noise constraints.; CONCLUSION: ADC and diffusion anisotropic scalars reflect biophysical changes in the underlying pathology of the demyelinating process.

N2  -  From the embarrassing character commonly infiltrating eloquent brain regions, the surgical resection of glioma remains challenging. Owing to the recent development of in vivo visualization techniques for the human brain, white matter regions can be delineated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a routine clinical practice in neurosurgery. In confirmation of the results of DTI tractography, a direct electrical stimulation (DES) substantially influences the investigation of cortico-subcortical networks, which can be identified via specific symptoms elicited in the concerned white matter tracts (eg., the arcuate fascicle, superior longitudinal fascicles, inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, inferior longitudinal fascicle, frontal aslant tract, sensori-motor tracts, optic radiation, and so forth). During awake surgery for glioma using DES, it is important to identify the anatomo-functional structure of white matter tracts to identify the surgical boundaries of brain regions not only to achieve maximal resection of the glioma but also to maximally preserve quality of life. However, the risk exists that neurosurgeons may be misled by the inability of DTI to visualize the actual anatomy of the white matter fibers, resulting in inappropriate decisions regarding surgical boundaries. This review article provides information of the critical neuronal network that is necessary to identify and understand in awake surgery for glioma, with special references to white matter tracts and the author's experiences.

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis leads to diffuse damage of the central nervous system, affecting also the normal-appearing white matter. Demyelination and axonal degeneration reduce regional fractional anisotropy in normal-appearing white matter, which can be routinely mapped with diffusion tensor imaging. However, the standard fractional anisotropy metric is also sensitive to physiological variations in orientation dispersion of white matter fibres. This complicates the detection of disease-related damage in large parts of cerebral white matter where microstructure physiologically displays a high degree of fibre dispersion. To resolve this ambiguity, we employed a novel tensor-valued encoding method for diffusion MRI, which yields a microscopic fractional anisotropy metric that is unaffected by regional variations in orientation dispersion. In 26 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, 14 patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis and 27 age-matched healthy controls, we compared standard fractional anisotropy mapping with the novel microscopic fractional anisotropy mapping method, focusing on normal-appearing white matter. Mean microscopic fractional anisotropy and standard fractional anisotropy of normal-appearing white matter were significantly reduced in both patient groups relative to healthy controls, but microscopic fractional anisotropy yielded a better reflection of disease-related white-matter alterations. The reduction in mean microscopic fractional anisotropy showed a significant positive linear relationship with physical disability, as reflected by the expanded disability status scale. Mean reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy in normal-appearing white matter also scaled positively with individual cognitive dysfunction, as measured with the symbol digit modality test. Mean microscopic fractional anisotropy reduction in normal-appearing white matter also showed a positive relationship with total white-matter lesion load as well as lesion load in specific tract systems. None of these relationships between normal-appearing white-matter microstructure and clinical, cognitive or structural measures emerged when using mean fractional anisotropy. Together, the results provide converging evidence that microscopic fractional anisotropy mapping substantially advances the assessment of cerebral white matter in multiple sclerosis by disentangling microstructure damage from variations in physiological fibre orientation dispersion at the stage of data acquisition. Since tensor-valued encoding can be implemented in routine diffusion MRI, microscopic fractional anisotropy mapping bears considerable potential for the future assessment of disease progression in normal-appearing white matter in both relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis as well as other white-matter-related brain diseases.

N2  -  Objectives To date, only four small studies have investigated the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer on the microstructure of cerebral white matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These studies, which were conducted shortly up to 10 years post-treatment, showed that chemotherapy is associated with focal loss of microstructural white matter integrity. We investigated the long-term effect of chemotherapy on white matter microstructural integrity by comparing the brains of chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors to those of a population-based sample of women without a history of cancer. Experimental design Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI (1.5 T) was performed in 187 CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil) chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors, mean age 64.2 (sd = 6.5) years, who had been diagnosed with cancer on average 21.2 (sd = 4.4) years before, and 374 age-matched cancer-free reference subjects from a population-based cohort study. Outcome measures were whole-brain microstructural integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy and mean/axial/radial diffusivity and focal white matter integrity, which was analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics. All analyses were adjusted for age, cardiovascular risk factors, education, and symptoms of depression. Principal observations No significant group differences were observed in white matter integrity. However, within the breast cancer survivors, time since treatment was inversely associated with lower global and focal white matter integrity. Conclusions This cross-sectional study suggests that among chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors white matter microstructural integrity deteriorates with accumulating time since treatment. This warrants further investigation. Hum Brain Mapp 35:889-899, 2014. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Purpose of Review This review will explore the latest in advanced imaging techniques, with a focus on the complementary nature of multiparametric, multimodality imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Recent Findings Advanced MRI techniques including perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and MR chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) offer significant advantages over conventional MR imaging when evaluating tumor extent, predicting grade, and assessing treatment response. PET performed in addition to advanced MRI provides complementary information regarding tumor metabolic properties, particularly when performed simultaneously. F-18-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET improves the specificity of tumor diagnosis and evaluation of post-treatment changes. Incorporation of radiogenomics and machine learning methods further improve advanced imaging. The complementary nature of combining advanced imaging techniques across modalities for brain tumor imaging and incorporating technologies such as radiogenomics has the potential to reshape the landscape in neuro-oncology.

N2  -  Object. The aim of surgical glioma treatment is the complete resection of tumor tissue while preserving neurological function. Surgery-related neurological deficits arise from direct damage to the cortical or subcortical structures or from ischemia. The authors aimed to assess the incidence of resection-related ischemia of newly diagnosed or recurrent supratentorial gliomas and the sensitivity of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOM) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for detecting such ischemic events and their influence on neurological motor function.
Methods. Between January 2009 and December 2010, 70 patients with tumors in motor-eloquent brain areas underwent intraoperative MEP monitoring during glioma resection and were examined by early postoperative MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. Postoperative areas of restricted diffusion were assessed by investigators blinded to the course of intraoperative MEPs and the neurological course.; Results. Among the 70 enrolled patients, a MEP amplitude decline below 50% of the baseline level was observed in 21 patients (30%). Sixteen of these patients (76%) had ischemic lesions identified on postoperative MRI scans. Forty-nine patients (70%) showed no decline in MEP amplitude, and only 16 (33%) of these patients harbored ischemic lesions. Moreover, 9 (69%) of 13 patients with a permanent loss of MEP amplitude showed postoperative ischemic lesions. Factors that promoted the occurrence of postoperative infarction were previous radiotherapy and location of the tumor close to the central arteries.; Conclusions. Alterations in the MEP amplitude during tumor resection and postoperative ischemic lesions are associated with postoperative impairment of motor function. Rather than cortical or subcortical structural damage of eloquent brain tissue alone, peri- or postoperative ischemic lesions play a crucial role in the development of surgery-related motor deficits.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping are functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques for detecting water diffusion. DWI and the ADC map were performed for intracranial lesions in two dogs. In necrotizing leukoencephalitis, cavitated lesions contained a hypointense center with a hyperintense periphery on DWI, and hyperintense signals on the ADC maps. In metastatic sarcoma, masses including a necrotic region were hypointense with DWI, and hyperintense on the ADC map with hyperintense perilesional edema on DWI and ADC map. Since DWI and ADC data reflect the altered water diffusion, they can provide additional information at the molecular level.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both revealed extensive cerebral venous thrombosis, concurrently with abnormal signals of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC): The splenium appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) imaging, and hypointense on T1 sequences and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. The patients were given thrombolytic therapy. Clinically, both patients achieved recovery with no neurologic sequelae, and follow-up MRI revealed complete resolution of the lesion in the SCC at day 36 and day 37 after initial presentation, respectively.

N2  -  Background Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus. Purpose We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements. Methods Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer's loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks. Results Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70-0.99; DSC = 0.84-0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82-0.99) than lesional OR (0.70-0.99). The non-lesional OR's mean volume was 22.66 cm(3); the mean Meyer's loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (+/- 1.00-3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively. Conclusion The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.

T2  -  WHITE MATTER IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE: ADVANCES IN DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING AND ITS APPLICATIONS

N2  -  Diffusion and perfusion MRI have contributed to stroke management by identifying patients with tissue "at risk" for further damage in acute stroke. However, the potential usefulness of these imaging modalities, along with diffusion tensor imaging, can be expanded by using these imaging techniques with concurrent assessment of language and other cognitive skills to identify the specific cognitive deficits that are associated with diffusion and perfusion abnormalities in particular brain regions. This paper illustrates how this combined behavioral and imaging methodology can yield information that is useful for predicting specific positive effects of intervention to restore blood flow in hypoperfused regions of brain identified with perfusion MRI, and for predicting negative effects of resection of particular brain regions or fiber bundles. Such data allow decisions about neurological and neurosurgical interventions to be based on specific risks and benefits in terms of functional consequences.

N2  -  Objective. - This study investigated whether or not the effect of contrast medium on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is time-related in patients with malignant brain tumours.
Patients and methods. - Twelve patients who only had malignant brain tumours were included in the study. DTI acquisitions were performed five times consecutively: twice before, once during, then twice after contrast injection. Diffusion indices were mapped and regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the tumour, peritumoral edema and contralateral normal brain tissue. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to investigate the effects of time on contrast medium in relation to diffusion indices.; Results. - Precontrast DTI was redefined as "pre" by averaging the two before-contrast scans, as there were no statistically significant differences between them. There were statistically significant differences at four time points for only the edema ROI for fractional anisotropy and the first-largest eigenvalue, but not for trace and the second-largest eigenvalue.; Conclusion. - The effects of contrast medium on DTI were time-dependent for diffusion anisotropic indices. DTI obtained at > 6 min after contrast injection does not cause significant changes in diffusion isotropic and anisotropic values. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  We report two patients with migraine, acute. visual field defects and other neurological symptoms who were found to have high T-2 signal and FLAIR abnormalities on brain MRI in temporal and parieto-occipital regions. In these patients, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of their lesions was increased, distinguishing these lesions from those of ischemic stroke. Both were ultimately diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We conclude that conventional MRI when used with diffusion-weighted MR imaging may be invaluable in detecting mitochondrial-related CNS dysfunction. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: Patients with pelvic abscess (n=23) or pelvic cystic tumor (n=15) who underwent diffusion-weighted MRI were reviewed. Results: Pelvic abscesses showed hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted MRI and hypointensity on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. The mean ADC values of fluid in pelvic abscess and pelvic tumors were 0.73 +/- 0.15x10(-3) and 2.27 +/- 0.45x10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. Pelvic abscesses had significantly lower ADC values than pelvic cystic tumors (P<.001). Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MRI provides a noncontrast method for interpreting pelvic cystic lesions.

N2  -  Although it is inarguable that conventional MRI (cMRI) has greatly contributed to the diagnosis and assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS), cMRI does not show close correlation with clinical findings or pathologic features, and is unable to predict prognosis or stratify disease severity. To this end, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography and neuroconnectivity analysis may assist disease assessment in MS. We, therefore, attempted this pilot study for initial assessment of early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Neuroconnectivity analysis was used for evaluation of 24 early RRMS patients within 2 years of presentation, and compared to the network measures of a group of 30 age-and-gender-matched normal control subjects. To account for the situation that the connections between two adjacent regions may be disrupted by an MS lesion, a new metric, network communicability, was adopted to measure both direct and indirect connections. For each anatomical area, the brain network communicability and average path length were computed and compared to characterize the network changes in efficiencies. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) loss of communicability was revealed in our RRMS cohort, particularly in the frontal and hippocampal/parahippocampal regions as well as the motor strip and occipital lobes. Correlation with the 25-foot Walk test with communicability measures in the left superior frontal (r = -0.71) as well as the left superior temporal gyrus (r = -0.43) and left postcentral gyrus (r = -0.41) were identified. Additionally identified were increased communicability between the deep gray matter structures (left thalamus and putamen) with the major interhemispheric and intrahemispheric white matter tracts, the corpus callosum, and cingulum, respectively. These foci of increased communicability are thought to represent compensatory changes. The proposed DTI-based neuroconnectivity analysis demonstrated quantifiable, structurally relevant alterations of fiber tract connections in early RRMS and paves the way for longitudinal studies in larger patient groups.

N2  -  Since its introduction in the mid-1980s, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which measures the random motion of water molecules in tissues, revealing their microarchitecture, has become a pillar of modern neuroimaging. Its main clinical domain has been the diagnosis of acute brain stroke and neurogical disorders, but it is also used in the body for the detection and management of cancer lesions. It can also produce stunning maps of white matter tracks in the brain, with the potential to aid in the understanding of some psychiatric disorders. However, in order to exploit fully the potential of this method, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that govern the diffusion of water in tissues is needed.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a sensitive imaging biomarker for tumor cellularity. Functional diffusion maps (fDMs), which examine voxel-by-voxel changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculated from serial DWIs, have previously been applied to regions of contrast-enhancement; however, application of fDMs to non-enhancing brain tumors has not been pursued. In this case study we demonstrate the utility of applying fDMs to regions of abnormal FLAIR signal intensity in a patient diagnosed with gliomatosis cerebri: a relatively rare, infiltrative, non-enhancing brain tumor. The absolute volume of hypercellularity extracted from fDMs was useful in tracking tumor growth, which correlated in time with a progressive decline in neurological status despite no change in traditional magnetic resonance images. Results of this study demonstrate the value of fDMs, applied to regions of FLAIR abnormal signal intensity, for localizing regions of hypercellularity and for monitoring overall tumor status.

N2  -  To enable application of non-Gaussian diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques in large-scale clinical trials and facilitate translation to clinical practice there is a requirement for fast, high contrast, techniques that are sensitive to changes in tissue structure which provide diagnostic signatures at the early stages of disease. Here we describe a new way to compress the acquisition of multi-shell b-value diffusion data, Quasi-Diffusion MRI (QDI), which provides a probe of subvoxel tissue complexity using short acquisition times (1-4 min). We also describe a coherent framework for multi-directional diffusion gradient acquisition and data processing that allows computation of rotationally invariant quasi-diffusion tensor imaging (QDTI) maps.
QDI is a quantitative technique that is based on a special case of the Continuous Time Random Walk model of diffusion dynamics and assumes the presence of non-Gaussian diffusion properties within tissue microstructure. QDI parameterises the diffusion signal attenuation according to the rate of decay (i.e. diffusion coefficient, D in mm(2) s(-1)) and the shape of the power law tail (i.e. the fractional exponent, alpha). QDI provides analogous tissue contrast to Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) by calculation of normalised entropy of the parameterised diffusion signal decay curve, H-n, but does so without the limitations of a maximum b-value.; We show that QDI generates images with superior tissue contrast to conventional diffusion imaging within clinically acceptable acquisition times of between 84 and 228 s. We show that QDI provides clinically meaningful images in cerebral small vessel disease and brain tumour case studies. Our initial findings suggest that QDI may be added to routine conventional dMRI acquisitions allowing simple application in clinical trials and translation to the clinical arena.

N2  -  Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors and occur in 20-40% of all cancer patients. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the most frequent primary cancers to develop brain metastases. Treatment options include surgical resection, whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and systemic treatment such as targeted or immune therapy. Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tumor (in particular post-Gadolinium T-1-weighted and T-2-weighted FLAIR) provide information about lesion morphology and structure, and are routinely used in clinical practice for both detection and treatment response evaluation for brain metastases. Advanced MRI biomarkers that characterize the cellular, biophysical, micro-structural and metabolic features of tumors have the potential to improve the management of brain metastases from early detection and diagnosis, to evaluating treatment response. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT), diffusion-based tissue microstructure imaging, trans-membrane water exchange mapping, and magnetic susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) are advanced MRI techniques that will be reviewed in this article as they pertain to brain metastases.

N2  -  Purpose of review
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain tumours provides excellent anatomical detail of brain tumours and can also reveal the biology, cellular structure and vascular dynamics of a tumour, although the use of such features in routine clinical practice has yet to be realized. In this review the latest advances in MRI of brain tumours are discussed and their clinical applications highlighted.; Recent findings; A large international study is underway to develop more powerful methods for automated classification of MR spectra based on the acquisition of large datasets of tumour spectra, Diffusion weighted imaging can help in the distinction between gliomas and abscesses, and perfusion weighted imaging can predict response to radiotherapy in low grade gliomas as well as distinguishing between different types of cerebral metastases. Intraoperative MRI has now been shown to be technically feasible, safe and effective in obtaining histological information as well as increasing the likelihood of complete resection for pituitary tumours and gliomas. Functional MRI and magnetic source imaging are alternative modalities that help the surgeon to avoid eloquent brain areas but may occasionally provide misleading information. Diffusion tensor imaging can demonstrate the effect of a tumour on white matter tracts and provides complementary information to that from other techniques that reveal areas of eloquent cortex.; Summary; Advances in MRI techniques are providing better diagnostic and therapeutic information, but can only ever be a surrogate marker of physiological and pathological processes; until it can routinely be used to image the brain at a cellular level, MRI will always be secondary to pathology in the final diagnostic evaluation.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in discrimination between high- and low-grade supratentorial nonenhancing gliomas (HGGs and LGGs, respectively) when using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values with high or standard b-value. Thirty-nine patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with standard and high b-values (b = 1000 and 3000 s/mm(2), respectively). Minimum, maximum, and mean ADC values (ADC(MIN), ADC(MAX), and ADC(MEAN), respectively) were measured from ADC maps with both b-values. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff ADC values for distinguishing between nonenhancing HGGs and LGGs. ADC(MIN), ADC(MAX), and ADC(MEAN) values for the nonenhancing HGGs were lower than those for LGGs. These differences were much larger when a high b-value was used (all P < 0.0001) than when a standard b-value was used (P = 0.0001, < 0.0001, and < 0.0001, respectively). Discriminant analysis indicated that the greatest likelihood for discriminating HGGs and LGGs when ADC(MEAN) was obtained with a high b-value, with cutoff value of 0.814 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. ADC values obtained with a high b-value can be useful for grading and surgical management of nonenhancing HGGs and LGGs. The lowest degree of overlap was obtained when ADC(MEAN) was determined with a b-value of 3000 s/mm(2).

N2  -  Background The values that have been received from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) might play a vital role in evaluating tumors and their grading scale. Purpose To investigate the predictive role of this heterogeneity in brain tumor pathologies and its correlation with Ki-67. Material and Methods A total of 124 patients with brain tumors underwent brain MRI with gadolinium injection. ADC and standard deviation of each lesion have been obtained from manual localization of the region of interest on the ADC map. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to determine the minimum cut-off values of the mean ADC and mean standard deviation of ADC maps having the highest sensitivity and specificity to differentiate high-grade and low-grade tumors. Results Mean ADC values in the region of interest were significantly lower for malignant tumors (grade IV and metastasis) than grade I brain tumors, while a higher mean standard deviation was observed. In a more detailed comparison of tumor groups, the mean standard deviation of the ADC for glioblastoma multiform was significantly higher than meningioma grade I (P < 0.001) and metastasis was significantly higher than grade III and IV astrocytic tumors (P = 0.004). The analysis of Ki-67 proliferation index and mean ADC values in gliomas showed a significant inverse correlation between the parameters (r = -0.0429, P < 0.001) and direct correlation between Ki-67 and mean standard deviation of the ADC (r = 0.551, P < 0.001). As an index for the ADC to differentiate high-grade and low-grade tumors, the cut-off values of 1.40*10(-3) mm(2)/s for mean ADC and 45*10(-3) mm(2)/s for mean standard deviation have the highest combination of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve. Conclusion The mean value and standard deviation of the ADC could be considered for differentiating between low-grade and high-grade brain tumors, as two available non-invasive methods.

N2  -  Desmoplastic infantile tumors are rare supratentorial brain lesions occurring in children under 18 months of age. We report characteristic neuroimaging with DWI and the histopathological features of these neoplasms.
Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of nine patients, aged 0-18 months (median age 3.5 months), were retrospectively analyzed. Analysis of MR images included location and tumor size, signal intensity, contrast enhancement, presence of edema, and hemorrhage. Minimum and mean value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the solid component of the tumor and contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were measured, and ADCNAWM ratios were calculated. All patients underwent tumor resection, and diagnosis of grade I desmoplastic tumors was confirmed.; The tumors were located in the temporal lobe in seven patients, the parietal lobe in three, and in the frontal lobe in one case (in two children, tumors invaded more than one lobe). Suprasellar localization was observed in two patients; one child had multifocal brain lesions. In five cases, signal intensity of the solid component was hypointense on T2-WI. The measured minimum ADC value of solid tumor varied from 0.606 to 1.020 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, with a mean value of 0.921 x 10(-3) mm(2)s. The mean ADC value of NAWM was 1.121 x 10(-3) mm(2)s. The mean ADC ratio was 0.858 x 10(-3) mm(2)s.; From our series, we can assume that restricted diffusion is observed not only in malignant but also in benign brain tumors. Diffusion signals and ADC values in these neoplasms appear to depend on their cellularity and components of the extracellular matrix.

N2  -  A transient lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum is a rare disease and its pathogenesis is unclear. We performed simultaneous diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and brain blood perfusion scintigraphy for a transient lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. This transient lesion showed hyperintensity on the diffusion-weighted images and hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. However, normal blood perfusion was observed on brain blood perfusion scintigraphy. Transient axonal or intramyelinic edema might be a cause of the transient lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of blood vessels in the brain is crucial because the progression of various neuropathologies ranging from Alzheimer's disease to brain tumors involves anomalous blood vessels. The challenges in obtaining such data from patients, in conjunction with development of mouse models of neuropathology, have made the murine brain indispensable for investigating disease induced neurovascular changes. Here we describe a novel method for "whole brain'' 3D mapping of murine neurovasculature using magnetic resonance microscopy (mMRI). This approach preserves the vascular and white matter tract architecture, and can be combined with complementary MRI contrast mechanisms such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the interplay between the vasculature and white matter reorganization that often characterizes neuropathologies. Following validation with micro computed tomography (mCT) and optical microscopy, we demonstrate the utility of this method by: (i) combined 3D imaging of angiogenesis and white matter reorganization in both, invasive and non-invasive brain tumor models; (ii) characterizing the morphological heterogeneity of the vascular phenotype in the murine brain; and (iii) conducting "multi-scale'' imaging of brain tumor angiogenesis, wherein we directly compared in vivo MRI blood volume measurements with ex vivo vasculature data.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare multiphasic perfusion computed tomography (CT) with diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting final infarct volume, infarct growth, and clinical severity in patients with hyperacute ischemia untreated by thrombolytic therapy.
Method: Multiphasic perfusion CT was performed in 19 patients with ischemic stroke within 6 hours of symptom onset. Two CT maps of peak and total perfusion were generated from CT data. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion MRI were obtained within 150 minutes after CT. Lesion volumes on CT and MRI were compared with final infarct volume and clinical scores, and mismatch on CT or MRI was compared with infarct growth.; Results: The lesion volume on the CT total perfusion map strongly correlated with MRI relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), and that on the CT peak perfusion map strongly correlated with MRI relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and rCBV (P < 0.001). The lesion volume on unenhanced CT or DWI moderately correlated with final infarct volume, but only lesion volume on unenhanced CT weakly correlated with baseline clinical scores (P = 0.024). The lesion volumes on the CT peak perfusion map and MRI rCBF similarly correlated with final infarct volume and clinical scores and more strongly than those on mean transit time (MTT) or time to peak (TTP). DWI-rCBF or CT mismatch was more predictive of infarct growth than DWI-MTT or DWI-TTP mismatch.; Conclusion: Multiphasic perfusion CT is useful and of comparable utility to diffusion and perfusion MRI for predicting final infarct volume, infarct growth, and clinical severity in acute ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Objective: To characterize normal and pathologic brain tissue by quantifying the deviation of diffusion-related signal from a simple monoexponential decay, when measured over a wider than usual range of b-factors. Methods and materials: Line scan diffusion imaging (LSDI), with diffusion weighting at multiple b-factors between 100 and 5000 s/mm(2), was performed on 1.5 T clinical scanners. Diffusion data of single slice sections were acquired in five healthy subjects and 19 brain tumor patients. Inpatients, conventional T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were obtained for reference purposes. The chisquare (chi(2)) error parameter associated with the monoexponential fits of the measured tissue water signals was then used to quantify the departure from a simple monoexponential signal decay on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Results: Diffusion-weighted images over a wider b-factor range than typically used were successfully obtained in all healthy subjects and patients. Normal and pathologic tissues demonstrated signal decays, which clearly deviate from a simple monoexponential behavior. The chi(2) of cortical and deep grey matter was considerably lower than in white matter. In peritumoral edema, however, chi(2) was 68% higher than in normal white matter. In highly malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma, chi(2) values were on average almost 400% higher than in normal white matter, while for one low grade astrocytoma and two cases of metastasis, chi(2) was not profoundly different from the chi(2) value of white matter. Maps of the chi(2) values provide good visualization of spatial details. However, the tumor tissue contrast generated appeared in many cases to be different from the enhancement produced by paramagnetic contrast agents. For example, in cases where the contrast agent only highlighted the rim of the tumor, chi(2) enhancement was present within the solid part of the tumor. Conclusion: The deviation from a purely monoexponential diffusion signal decay becomes evident as diffusion encoding is extended well beyond the normal range. The chi(2) error parameter as a measure of this deviation seems to provide sufficient lesion contrast to permit differentiation of malignant brain tumors from normal brain tissue.

N2  -  Brain tumor patients are usually accompanied by impairments in cognitive functions, and these dysfunctions arise from the altered diffusion tensor of water molecules and disrupted neuronal conduction in white matter. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful noninvasive imaging technique that can reflect diffusion anisotropy of water and brain white matter neural connectivity in vivo. This study was aimed to analyze the topological properties and connection densities of the brain anatomical networks in brain tumor patients based on DTI and provide new insights into the investigation of the structural plasticity and compensatory mechanism of tumor patient's brain.
In this study, the brain anatomical networks of tumor patients and healthy controls were constructed using the tracking of white matter fiber bundles based on DTI and the topological properties of these networks were described quantitatively. The statistical comparisons were performed between two groups with six DTI parameters: degree, regional efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, vulnerability, and betweenness centrality. In order to localize changes in structural connectivity to specific brain regions, a network-based statistic approach was utilized. By comparing the edge connection density of brain network between two groups, the edges with greater difference in connection density were associated with three functional systems.; Compared with controls, tumor patients show a significant increase in small-world feature of cerebral structural network. Two-sample two-tailed t test indicates that the regional properties are altered in 17 regions (). Study reveals that the positive and negative changes in vulnerability take place in the 14 brain areas. In addition, tumor patients lose 3 hub regions and add 2 new hubs when compared to normal controls. Eleven edges show much significantly greater connection density in the patients than in the controls. Most of the edges with greater connection density are linked to regions located in the limbicsubcortical and other systems. Besides, most of the edges connect the two hemispheres of the brains.; The stronger small-world property in the tumor patients proves the existence of compensatory mechanism. The changes in the regional properties, especially the betweenness centrality and vulnerability, aid in understanding the brain structural plasticity. The increased connection density in the tumor group suggests that tumors may induce reorganization in the structural network.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology resulting in cerebral edema in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is unknown. To investigate the changes in white matter microstructure in this disease, we measured diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial and axial diffusivity in children with DKA at two time points during treatment.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA. Thirty-two children admitted with DKA (pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mEql, glucose > 300 mgdl, and ketosis; 11.9 +- 3.2 y; and 47% male) were enrolled and underwent two serial paired diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans following hospital admission. Seventeen of the 32 participants had diffusion tensor images of adequate quality for tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis.; RESULTS: TBSS mapping demonstrated main white matter tract areas with a significant increase in FA and areas with a significant decrease in ADC, from the first to the second MRI. Both radial and axial diffusivity,terms showed change, with a diffuse pattern of involvement.; CONCLUSION: Consistent DTI changes occurred during DKA treatment over a short time frame. These findings describe widespread water diffusion abnormalities in DKA, supporting an association between clinical illness and DTI markers of microstructural change in white matter.

N2  -  The aim was to evaluate volume, diffusion, and perfusion metrics for better presurgical differentiation between high-grade gliomas (HGG), low-grade gliomas (LGG), and metastases (MET). For this retrospective study, 43 patients with histologically verified intracranial HGG (n = 18), LGG (n = 10), and MET (n = 15) ere chosen. Preoperative magnetic resonance data included pre- and post-gadolinium contrast-enhanced -weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recover, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), fractional anisotropy, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps used for quantification of magnetic resonance biometrics by manual delineation of regions of interest. A binary logistic regression model was applied for multiparametric analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Statistically significant differences w ere found for normalized-ADC-tumor (nADC-T), normalized-CBF-turnor (nCBF-T), normalized-CBV-turnor (nCBV-T), and normalized-CBF-edema (nCBF-E) between LGG and HGG, and when these metrics were combined, HGG could be distinguished from LGG with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%,. The only metric to distinguish HGG from MET was the normalized-ADC-E with a sensitivity of 68.8% and a specificity of 80%, LGG can be distinguished from MET by combining edema volume (Vol-E), Vol-E/tumor volume (Vol-T), nADC-T, nCBF-T, nCBV-T, and nADC-E with a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 100%. The present study confirms the usability of a multibiometric approach including volume, perfusion, and diffusion metrics in differentially diagnosing brain tumors in preoperative patients and adds to the growing body of evidence in the clinical field in need of validation and standardization.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses have detected increased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in callosal and projection systems of adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We explored whether similar changes occur in pediatric patients with MS, assessing 3 major white matter pathways (interhemispheric, projection, and intrahemispheric) in both visibly involved and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI datasets from 10 patients with established pediatric MS and 10 age-sex-, and imaging technique-matched controls were analyzed. Tracts were reconstructed by using a fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm with a diffusion-weighted imaging mask and a 35 degrees angular threshold. Tracts were selected by using standard ROI placements on color FA maps cross-referenced to b = 0 T2-weighted images for studying white matter pathways. Ten identical ROIs were placed in NAWM on b = 0 T2-weighted images to ensure that both ROIs and resulting tracts passed through NAWM.; RESULTS: In pediatric MS, all tracts had higher mean ADC values (P = .002 to P < .04) and lower mean FA(P = .009 to P < .02) than those in healthy controls. Even when the tracts were confined to NAWM, the mean ADC was higher (P < .004 to P < .05) and the mean FA was lower (P = .002 to P < .02). T2 lesion burden correlated with tract-based mean ADC. ROI mean ADC increased, and both tract and 1901 mean FA decreased with increasing T2 lesion burden, however with a statistically nonsignificant correlation.; CONCLUSIONS: Increased mean ADC and decreased mean FA occur in all 3 major white matter pathways, both in visibly involved white matter and NAWM in pediatric MS.

N2  -  Background
The posterior fossa is situated between the tentorium cerebelli above and the foramen magnum below. Vital structures like the cerebellum, the pons, and the medulla are situated within it; hence, tumors within the posterior fossa are considered one of the most critical brain lesions. Children are more likely to develop posterior fossa tumors than adults. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) sequences along with the conventional MRI help in providing additional information in the characterization of the various posterior fossa tumors. We hereby present a series of 30 patients with clinically suspected posterior fossa masses who underwent preoperative MRI.; Objectives; This study aims to differentiate the neoplastic from non-neoplastic posterior fossa mass by evaluating the diffusion restriction pattern on DWI, quantifying the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map in various posterior fossa tumors, and comparing the different metabolites of various posterior fossa tumors on MRS.; Results; Out of the 30 patients with posterior fossa lesions, 18 were males and 12 were females. Eight of them were in the pediatric age group, while twenty-two of them were adults. Metastasis was the most common posterior fossa lesion in our study sample and was found in six patients (20%), followed by vestibular schwannomas (17%) and arachnoid cysts (13%), meningiomas, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma (10% each) and epidermoid, ependymoma, and hemangioblastoma (7% each). The mean ADC value of benign tumors was higher than that of malignant tumors, and this difference was found to be significant (p = 0.012). The cut-off ADC value 1.21x 10-3mm2 s had a sensitivity of 81.82% and specificity of 80.47%. MRS metabolites played an additional role in differentiating benign from malignant tumors.; Conclusion; A combination of conventional MRI, DWI, ADC values, and MRS metabolites showed good diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between the various posterior fossa neoplastic tumors both in adults and children.

N2  -  Background and purpose: a review of the literature reveals the increasing interest in using Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, with diffusion weighted images (DWI) and ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) quantitation, in pediatric hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, ADC and MTR (Magnetization Transfer Ratio) as quantitative tools have not been investigated together in these pathological conditions in young pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to apply a quantitative method by using ADC and MTR calculation in order to propose a reproducible quantitation of brain parenchymal lesions.
Methods: we conducted a prospective study including all children presenting with suspected cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury. 15 children were included, among them 10 males and 5 females aged from 36 weeks of gestation to 17 months with a median age of 10,5 months. All MR examinations were performed at 1.5 Tesla unit including conventional MR (T1, T2 and Inversion-recovery sequences) and DWI with ADC map. ADC and MTR ROI (region of interest) measurements were made, in the frontal subcortical and periventricular white matter (WM) as well as in the gray matter (GM=basal ganglia), and in focal lesions.; Results: ADC and MTR values were abnormal in focal lesions and in diffuse injury with no evidence of lesion on conventional MRI and DWI. We observed a strong inverse correlation between these ADC and MTR (R 0,66 in WM; R=0,61 in GM).; Conclusion: ADC and MTR calculation may be helpful as a reproductive method to quantify the lesions and detect diffuse lesions in hypoxic-ischemic pediatric brain injury.

N2  -  In recent years, advances in ultrafast technology and a better understanding of the physical principles underlying the effect of MR contrast media have given rise to a new functional imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance. Functional techniques allow the acquisition of maps of the main haemodynamic parameters (perfusion MR or PWI), evaluation of the mobility of water molecules (diffusion MR or DWI) and the study of neuronal activation (fMRI).
The combination of different functional techniques allows assessment of different complementary aspects of brain pathophysiology, during the same examination so that they cart be combined with information provided by conventional scans Following the advent of ultrafast techniques, functional MR imaging initially confined to research has gradually been introduced into clinical practice.; This paper briefly described the physical principles underlying the diffusion and perfusion techniques and the main clinical applications.

N2  -  Objective: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized using tractography.
Methods: Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography.; Results: We present the first DTI and tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 31) with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments.; Conclusions: Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. Significance: DTI is a quantitative method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography methods.

N2  -  A 52-year-old woman, previously treated for gastric cancer, began hemodialysis (HD) to treat the onset of severe acidemia. After her initial HD sessions, she suffered from a prolonged coma for approximately ten days. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse leukoencephalopathy, with increased apparent diffusion coefficient. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a reduction of the N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio. Her neuroimaging findings gradually resolved. Her transient cerebral white matter lesions were thought to be interstitial edema derived from dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS), which might have been amplified by subclinical brain injury due to past chemotherapy. Her history of cancer chemotherapy may be a risk factor for an exacerbation of DDS.

N2  -  We describe the regional distribution of acute perfusion, diffusion, and final infarct lesions in middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk occlusion. A total of 31 patients with acute ischemic stroke and MCA trunk occlusion were studied by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Probabilistic maps of lesion distribution were generated. The probability of initial and final infarcts was highest in the central MCA region with decreasing probability toward the periphery where the probability of the tissue at risk of infarction to be saved was highest. The probability of brain regions being involved in acute diffusion lesions and evolving into or escaping from the final infarct relates to the anatomy of arterial blood supply.

N2  -  Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a hallmark of traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathology. Recently, the Closed Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) was developed to generate an experimental model of DAI in a mouse. The characterization of DAI using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) may provide a useful set of outcome measures for preclinical and clinical studies. The objective of this study was to identify the complex neurobiological underpinnings of DTI features following DAI using a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of DTI and histopathology in the CHIMERA mouse model. A consistent neuroanatomical pattern of pathology in specific white matter tracts was identified across ex vivo DTI maps and photomicrographs of histology. These observations were confirmed by voxelwise and regional analysis of DTI maps, demonstrating reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in distinct regions such as the optic tract. Similar regions were identified by quantitative histology and exhibited axonal damage as well as robust gliosis. Additional analysis using a machine-learning algorithm was performed to identify regions and metrics important for injury classification in a manner free from potential user bias. This analysis found that diffusion metrics were able to identify injured brains almost with the same degree of accuracy as the histology metrics. Good agreement between regions detected as abnormal by histology and MRI was also found. The findings of this work elucidate the complexity of cellular changes that give rise to imaging abnormalities and provide a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the relative importance of DTI and histological measures to detect brain injury.

N2  -  Streamline representation of major fiber tract systems along with high-resolution anatomical data provides a reliable orientation for the neurosurgeon. For intraoperative visualization of these data either on navigation screens near the surgical field or directly in the surgical field applying heads-up displays of operating microscopes, wrapping of all streamlines of interest to render an individual object representing the whole fiber bundle is the most suitable representation. Integration of fiber tract data into a neuronavigation setup allows removal of tumors adjacent to eloquent brain areas with low morbidity.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography provides useful information that can be used to optimize surgical planning and help avoid injury during subcortical dissection of eloquent tracts. The objective is to provide a safe, timely, and affordable algorithm for preoperative DTI language reconstruction for intrinsic frontotemporal diseases.
METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively acquired database of preoperative DTI reconstruction for resection of left frontotemporal lesions over 3 years at Hospital de San Jose and Hospital Infantil Universitario San Jose, Fundacion Universitaria de Ciencias de la Salud, Bogota, Colombia. Preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiographic features were determined from retrospective chart review. A comprehensive review of the structural and functional anatomy of the language tracts was performed. Separate reconstruction of both ventral (semantic) and dorsal (phonologic) stream pathways is described: arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.; RESULTS: Between January 2015 and January 2018, 44 tumor cases were found to be resected with preoperative fiber tracking planning and neuronavigation-guided surgery. Ten patients (7 women, 3 men) aged 28-65 years underwent resection of an intrinsic frontotemporal lesion with preoperative DTI tractography reconstruction of language tracts. Eight cases (80%) were high-grade gliomas and 2 (20%) were cavernous malformations. In 5 cases (50%), the lesion was in the frontal lobe and in 5 (50%), it was in the temporal lobe. The extent of resection was classified as gross total resection (100%), subtotal resection (>90%), or partial resection (<90%). Gross total resection was achieved in 5 cases (50%), subtotal resection was achieved in 4 cases (40%), and partial resection in the remaining case (10%). Compromised tracts included superior longitudinal fasciculus in 7 (70%), inferior longitudinal fasciculus in 4 (40%), the arcuate fasciculus in 3 (30%), and uncinate fasciculus in 1 (10%). Language function was unchanged or improved in 90% of patients. New-onset postoperative language decline occurred in 1 patient, who recovered transient phonemic paraphasias 1 month after resection. The mean follow-up time was 7 months (range, 4-12 months). Residual tumors were treated with radiation andor with chemotherapy as indicated in an outpatient setting.; CONCLUSIONS: We present a safe and efficacious preoperative DTI language reconstruction algorithm that could be used as a feasible treatment strategy in a challenging subset of tumors in low-to middle-income countries.

N2  -  Several quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been proposed to investigate microstructural tissue changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetization transfer imaging, and R2* mapping. Here, in this study, we compared these techniques with regard to their capability for detecting ALS related white matter (WM) changes in the brain and their association with clinical findings. We examined 27 ALS patients and 35 age-matched healthy controls. MRI was performed at 3T, after which we analyzed the diffusion properties, the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and the effective transversal relaxation rate R2* in 18 WM tracts that were obtained by a fully automated segmentation technique. ALS patients, especially with a bulbar onset, showed a bilateral increase in radial and mean diffusivity, as well as a reduction in fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract (CST), and diffusion changes in the parietal and temporal superior longitudinal fasciculus. A reduction of the MTR was found in both CSTs and an R2* reduction was seen only in the left CST. Tract-specific diffusion properties were not related to clinical status in a cross-sectional manner but demonstrated some association with disease progression over three subsequent months. DTI reveals more widespread WM tissue changes than MTR and R2*. These changes are not restricted to the CST, but affect also other WM tracts (especially in patients with bulbar onset), and are associated with the short term course of the disease.

N2  -  Purpose: To establish a novel approach for fiber tracking based on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) mapping of the primary motor cortex and to propose a new algorithm for determination of an individualized fractional anisotropy value for reliable and objective fiber tracking.
Methods: 50 patients (22 females, 28 males, median age 58 years (20-80)) with brain tumors compromising the primary motor cortex and the corticospinal tract underwent preoperative MR imaging and nTMS mapping. Stimulation spots evoking muscle potentials (MEP) closest to the tumor were imported into the fiber tracking software and set as seed points for tractography. Next the individual FA threshold, i.e. the highest FA value leading to visualization of tracts at a predefined minimum fiber length of 110 mm, was determined. Fiber tracking was then performed at a fractional anisotropy value of 75% and 50% of the individual FA threshold. In addition, fiber tracking according to the conventional knowledge-based approach was performed. Results of tractography of either method were presented to the surgeon for preoperative planning and integrated into the navigation system and its impact was rated using a questionnaire.; Results: Mapping of the motor cortex was successful in all patients. A fractional anisotropy threshold for corticospinal tract reconstruction could be obtained in every case. TMS-based results changed or modified surgical strategy in 23 of 50 patients (46%), whereas knowledge-based results would have changed surgical strategy in 11 of 50 patients (22%). Tractography results facilitated intraoperative orientation and electrical stimulation in 28 of 50 (56%) patients. Tracking at 75% of the individual FA thresholds was considered most beneficial by the respective surgeons.; Conclusions: Fiber tracking based on nTMS by the proposed standardized algorithm represents an objective visualization method based on functional data and provides a valuable instrument for preoperative planning and intraoperative orientation and monitoring.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate the diffusion time dependence of signal-versus-b curves obtained from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) of sub-acute ischaemic lesions in stroke patients. In this case series study, 16 patients with sub-acute ischaemic stroke were examined with DW-MRI using two different diffusion times (60 and 260 ms). Nine of these patients showed sufficiently large lesions without artefacts to merit further analysis. The signal-versus-b curves from the lesions were plotted and analysed using a two-compartment model including compartmental exchange. To validate the model and to aid the interpretation of the estimated model parameters, Monte Carlo simulations were performed. in eight cases, the plotted signal-versus-b curves, obtained from the lesions, showed a signal-curve split-up when data for the two diffusion times were compared, revealing effects of compartmental water exchange. For one of the patients, parametric maps were generated based on the extracted model parameters. These novel observations suggest that water exchange between different water pools is measurable and thus potentially useful for clinical assessment. The information can improve the understanding of the relationship between the DW-MRI signal intensity and the microstructural properties of the lesions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance images (MRI) that depict rates of water diffusion in tissues can be used to characterize the cellularity of tumors and are valuable in assessing their early response to treatment. Water diffusion rates are sensitive to the cellular and molecular content of tissues and are affected by local microstructural changes associated with tumor development. However, conventional maps of water diffusion reflect the integrated effects of restrictions to free diffusion at multiple scales up to a specific limiting spatial dimension, typically several micrometers. Such measurements cannot distinguish effects caused by structural variations at a smaller scale. Variations in diffusion rates then largely reflect variations in the density of cells, and no information is available about changes on a subcellular scale. We report here our experiences using a new approach based on Oscillating Gradient SpinEcho (OGSE) MRI methods that can differentiate the influence on water diffusion of structural changes on scales much smaller than the diameter of a single cell. MRIs of glioblastomas in rat brain in vivo show an increased contrast and spatial heterogeneity when diffusion measurements are selectively sensitized to shorter distance scales. These results show the benefit of OGSE methods for revealing microscopic variations in tumors in vivo and confirm that diffusion measurements depend on factors other than cellularity.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: To compare quantitative imaging parameter measures from diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in subjects with brain tumors that have been processed with different software platforms.
Materials and Methods: Scans from 20 subjects with primary brain tumors were selected from-the Comprehensive Neuro-oncology Data Repository at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Swedish Neuroscience Institute. MR images-were coregistered, and each subject's data set was processed by three Software packages: 1) vendor-specific scanner software, 2) research software developed at WUSM, and 3) a commercially available, Food and Drug Administration-approved, processing platform (Nordic Ice). Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen within the brain tumor and normal nontumor tissue. The results obtained using these methods were compared.; Results: For diffusion parameters, including mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, concordance was high when comparing different processing methods. For perfusion-imaging parameters, a significant variance in cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and mean transit time (MTT) values was seen when comparing the same raw data processed using different software platforms. Correlation was better with larger ROIs (radii >= 5 mm). Greatest variance was observed in MTT.; Conclusions: Diffusion parameter values were consistent across different software processing platforms. Perfusion parameter values were more variable and were. influenced by the software used Variation in the MTT was especially large suggesting that MTT estimation may be unreliable in tumor tissues using current MRI perfusion methods.

N2  -  Radiologic findings of Bing-Neel syndrome, which is an extremely uncommon complication resulting from malignant lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), have been infrequently reported due to extreme rarity of the case. A 75-year-old man with WM presented at a neurology clinic with progressive gait and memory disturbances, and dysarthria of 2 months duration. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis showed IgM kappa-type monoclonal gammopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal, hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted-images. Brain diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated hyperintensities in cerebral and cerebellar lesions that appeared isointense on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, which were compatible with vasogenic edema. Although histologic analysis is a confirmative study to prove direct cell infiltration into the brain, brain MRI with DWI may be a good supportive study to diagnose Bing-Neel syndrome.

N2  -  Three cases of bacterial brain abscesses, in immunocompetent patients, are reported. In all these cases, the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MRI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map has permitted an early diagnosis and a rapid treatment This emergency MRI showed in the three cases a low signal on T1-weighted images, a high signal on T2-weighted and echo-planar images, and a decrease of ADC (0.36-0.49X10(-3)mm(2)/s). So, this new MRI technique provides an available and rapid element in the brain abscess diagnosis which often remains a complex clinical and radiological diagnosis.

N2  -  Objective: We aimed to explore the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of brain metastases and high-grade brain gliomas. Methods: Fifty patients with brain metastases and 28 patients with highgrade gliomas treated in the neurosurgery department of our hospital were selected for this study. All patients underwent routine MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The average diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the tumor parenchyma, peritumoral edema area, and the contralateral normal cerebral white matter were compared between the patients with brain metastases and the patients with high-grade brain gliomas. Results: There were differences in the degree of peritumoral edema between the two groups of patients (P = 0.017). Compared with the patients with high-grade gliomas, the patients with brain metastases had lower FA values in the tumor parenchyma area, higher ADC values in the peritumoral edema area, and lower rCBV and rCBF values in the peritumoral edema area (all P<0.001). Conclusion: The measurement of the ADC, rCBV, and rCBF values in the peritumoral edema area and the FA values in the tumor parenchyma area using multimodal MRI can have essential clinical value in the differentiation between brain metastases and high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Anti-angiogenic agents targeting brain tumor neovasculature may increase progression-free survival in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. However, when these patients do recur it is not always apparent as an increase in enhancing tumor volume on MRI, which has been the standard of practice for following patients with brain tumors. Therefore alternative methods are needed to evaluate patients treated with these novel therapies. Furthermore, a method that can also provide useful information for the evaluation of conventional therapies would provide an important advantage for general applicability. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) has the potential to serve as a valuable biomarker for these purposes. In the current study, we explore the prognostic ability of functional diffusion maps (fDMs), which examine voxel-wise changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) over time, applied to regions of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities in patients with malignant glioma, treated with either anti-angiogenic or cytotoxic therapies. Results indicate that the rate of change in fDMs is an early predictor of tumor progression, time to progression and overall survival for both treatments, suggesting the application of fDMs in FLAIR abnormal regions may be a significant advance in brain tumor biomarker technology.

N2  -  Nowadays, different anatomical atlases exist for the anatomical interpretation of the results from neuroimaging and lesion analysis studies that investigate the contribution of white matter fiber tract integrity to cognitive (dys) function. A major problem with the use of different atlases in different studies, however, is that the anatomical interpretation of neuroimaging and lesion analysis results might vary as a function of the atlas used. This issue might be particularly prominent in studies that investigate the contribution of white matter fiber tract integrity to cognitive (dys)function. We used a single large-sample dataset of right brain damaged stroke patients with and without cognitive deficit (here: spatial neglect) to systematically compare the influence of three different, widely-used white matter fiber tract atlases (1 histology-based atlas and 2 DTI tractography-based atlases) on conclusions concerning the involvement of white matter fiber tracts in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction. We both calculated the overlap between the statistical lesion analysis results and each long association fiber tract (topological analyses) and performed logistic regressions on the extent of fiber tract damage in each individual for each long association white matter fiber tract (hodological analyses). For the topological analyses, our results suggest that studies that use tractography-based atlases are more likely to conclude that white matter integrity is critical for a cognitive (dys)function than studies that use a histology-based atlas. The DTI tractography-based atlases classified approximately 10 times as many voxels of the statistical map as being located in a long association white matter fiber tract than the histology-based atlas. For hodological analyses on the other hand, we observed that the conclusions concerning the overall importance of long association fiber tract integrity to cognitive function do not necessarily depend on the white matter atlas used, but conclusions may vary as a function of atlas used at the level of individual fiber tracts. Moreover, these analyses revealed that hodological studies that express the individual extent of injury to each fiber tract as a binomial variable are more likely to conclude that white matter integrity is critical for a cognitive function than studies that express the individual extent of injury to each fiber tract as a continuous variable.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: An early maximal safe surgical resection is the current treatment paradigm for low-grade glioma (LGG). Nevertheless, there are no reliable methods to accurately predict the axonal intratumoral eloquent areas and, consequently, to predict the extent of resection.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the functional predictive value of eloquent white matter tracts within the tumor by using a pre- and postoperative intratumoral diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography protocol in patients with LGG.; METHODS: A preoperative intratumoral DTI-based tractography protocol, using the tumor segmented volume as the only seed region, was used to assess the tracts within the tumor boundaries in 22 consecutive patients with LGG. The reconstructed tracts were correlated with intraoperative electrical stimulation (IES)-based language and motor subcortical mapping findings and the extent of resection was assessed by tumor volumetrics.; RESULTS: Identification of intratumoral language and motor tracts significantly predicted eloquent areas within the tumor during the IES mapping: the positive predictive value for the pyramidal tract, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the arcuate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus positive was 100%, 100%, 33%, and 80%, respectively, whereas negative predictive value was 100% for all of them. The reconstruction of at least one of these tracts within the tumor was significantly associated with a lower extent of resection (67%) as opposed to the extent of resection in the cases with a negative intratumoral tractography (100%) (P < .0001).; CONCLUSION: Intratumoral DTI-based tractography is a simple and reliable method, useful in assessing glioma resectability based on the analysis of intratumoral eloquent areas associated with motor and language tracts within the tumor.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the possibility to study the course of the cerebral white matter tracts whereas functional MRI (fMRI) provides information about the specific functions of cortical areas. We evaluated the combination of fMRI and diffusion-weighted MRI to detect cortical visual areas with their corresponding visual fiber tracts in 15 healthy controls (age: 23 - 53 years, male: female = 8: 7). We demonstrated activation within the primary visual cortex and white matter bundles connecting the lateral geniculate body and the striate cortex in all subjects investigated. Additional activation could be appreciated in some subjects within the lateral geniculate bodies (n = 2) and the motion-sensitive area V5 (n = 3). The combination of diffusion-weighted and functional imaging allows visualization of the origin, direction and functionality of large white matter tracts. This will prove helpful for imaging structural connectivity within the brain during functional imaging. Moreover, this technique might provide important information for neurosurgical patients presenting with space-occupying lesions close to the cortical and subcortical visual system since this technique can - in contrast to diffusion tensor imaging - easily be adopted into a neuronavigation system and can be performed on all MR scanners capable of diffusion-weighted imaging without specific post-processing programs.

N2  -  Purpose: To achieve maximal safe resection during brain tumor surgery, functional image-merged neuronavigation is widely used. We retrospectively reviewed our cases in which diffusion tensor image (DTI)-merged functional neuronavigation was performed during surgery Materials and Methods: Between November 2008 and May 2010, 123 patients underwent surgery utilizing DTI-merged neuronavigation. Anatomical magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained preoperatively and fused with DTI of major white matter tracts, such as the corticospinal tract, optic radiation, or arcuate fasciculus. We used this fused image for functional neuronavigation during brain tumor surgery of eloquent areas. We checked the DTI images together with postoperative MRI images and evaluated the integrity of white matter tracts. Results: A single white matter tract was inspected in 78 patients, and two or more white matter tracts were checked in 45 patients. Among the 123 patients, a grossly total resection was achieved in 90 patients (73.2%), subtotal resection in 29 patients (23.6%), and partial resection in 4 patients (3.3%). Postoperative neurologic outcomes, compared with preoperative function, included the following: 100 patients (81.3%) displayed improvement of neurologic symptoms or no change, 7 patients (5.7%) experienced postoperative permanent neurologic deterioration (additional or aggravated neurologic symptoms), and 16 patients (13.0%) demonstrated transient worsening. Conclusion: DTI-merged functional neuronavigation could be a useful tool in brain tumor surgery for maximal safe resection. However, there are still limitations, including white matter tract shift, during surgery and in DTI itself Further studies should be conducted to overcome these limitations.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to show how, despite pathognomonic signs of cerebral involvement in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), mitochondrial respiratory chain insufficiency is associated with increased lactate and reduced N-acetylaspartate. CPEO and mitochondrial myopathy are caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Cortical and subcortical metabolites, cerebral diffusivity, and structural MRI were assessed to characterize possible subclinical cerebral pathology in CPEO.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Ten patients with CPEO (n = 8), mitochondrial myopathy (n = 1), and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (n = 1) and 13 control group volunteers were studied by MRI, both long TE (144) proton MR spectroscopic imaging (H-1 MRSI), and diffusion-weighted imaging. Relative concentrations of N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, and lactate were estimated by Linear Combination of Model Spectra (LCModel) in healthy-appearing white matter, gray matter, and white matter hyperintensities.; RESULTS. Of five patients with cortical atrophy, it was moderate in three and severe in two. One patient had severe and four had moderate cerebellar atrophy. Six of 10 patients showed unspecific white matter lesions, whereas the remainder had hyperintensities in the pyramidal tract (n = 2) and middle cerebellar peduncle (n = 1) despite clinical signs. No basal ganglia lesions were found. Physiologic metabolite ratios were normal and lactate was absent in supratentorial healthy-appearing cortex and subcortical white matter. Global diffusion histogram metrics revealed no abnormalities.; CONCLUSION. Normal spectroscopic imaging in radiologic unaffected brain and healthy global brain parenchymal diffusion findings do not support the hypothesis of a generalized cerebral energy loss in CPEO. Bilateral structural alteration of central motor pathways in two patients without clinical pyramidal signs may, however, reflect subclinical axonal injury in predilection sites in some patients.

N2  -  Morphofunctional changes of the brain tissues of Wistar rats were studied based on the development of a multifactor cardiovasorenal model of arterial hypertension using MRI. An increase of the signal on the diffusion brain maps was recorded in 3 months, which indicated fluid accumulation in the intra- and extracellular space of the brain tissue. The data characterize the development of the pathogenetic mechanism of the hypervolemic variant of experimental arterial hypertension. The development of endothelial dysfunction in the brain vessels was manifested by predominance of abnormal constrictor reactions. In 6 months after arterial hypertension simulation, structural changes in the brain developed, such as leukoareosis, cystic encephalomalacia with dilated cerebrospinal fluid spaces and limited blood supply to brain tissue in the basins of the large cerebral arteries.

N2  -  Objective To determine the usefulness of the R2* value in assessing the histopathological grade of glioma at magnetic resonance imaging and differentiating various brain tumours.
Methods Sixty-four patients with brain tumours underwent R2* mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging examinations. ANOVA was performed to analyse R2* values among four groups of glioma and among high-grade gliomas (grades III and IV), low-grade gliomas (grades I and II), meningiomas, and brain metastasis. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationships between the R2* values or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the histopathological grade of gliomas. R2* values of low-and high-grade gliomas were analysed with the receiver-operator characteristic curve.; Results R2* values were significantly different among high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastasis, but not between grade I and grade II or between grade III and grade IV. The R2* value (18.73) of high-grade gliomas provided a very high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating low-grade gliomas. A strong correlation existed between the R2* value and the pathological grade of gliomas.; Conclusions R2* mapping is a useful sequence for determining grade of gliomas and in distinguishing benign from malignant tumours. R2* values are better than ADC for characterising gliomas.; Key Points; Magnetic resonance imaging parameters are increasingly used to assess cerebral lesions.; R2* values are better than diffusion weighting for characterising gliomas.; R2* values can help distinguish among different grades of glioma.; Significant difference existed in R2* values between high- and low-grade gliomas.

N2  -  Fiber tractography assisted Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been performed by different groups for more than 10 years to now. Groups around the world have adapted initial approaches to currently embrace the fiber tractography technology mainly for treating tremor (DBS and lesions), psychiatric indications (OCD and major depression) and pain (DBS). Despite the advantages of directly visualizing the target structure, the technology is demanding and is vulnerable to inaccuracies especially since it is performed on individual level. In this contribution, we will focus on tremor and psychiatric indications, and will show future applications of sophisticated tractography applications for subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS surgery and stimulation steering as an example.

N2  -  Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in many organs, resulting in clinical symptoms, mostly hepatic and neuropsychiatric. As copper accumulates in the brain during WD, and almost 50% of WD patients at diagnosis present with neurological symptoms, neuroimaging studies (especially brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) are part of WD diagnosis. The classical sequences (T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) were used to describe brain MRI; however, with the development of neuroradiology, several papers proposed the use of new MRI sequences and techniques like susceptibility-weighted images, T2*, diffusion MRI, tractography, volumetric assessment and post-processing brain MRI analysis of paramagnetic accumulation-quantitative susceptibility mapping. Based on these neuroradiological data in WD, currently, brain MRI semiquantitative scale and the pathognomonic neuroradiological brain MRI signs in WD were proposed. Further, the volumetric studies and brain iron accumulation MRI analysis suggested brain atrophy and iron accumulation as biomarkers of neurological WD disease severity. All these results highlight the significance of brain MRI examinations in WD. Due to the extreme progress of these studies, based on the available literature, the authors present the current state of knowledge about the significance, practical aspects, and future directions of brain MRI in WD.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives. To perform a retrospective, quantitative assessment of the anatomic relationship between intra-axial, supratentorial, primary brain tumors, and adjacent white matter fiber tracts based on anatomic and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We hypothesized that white matter infiltration may be common among different types of tumor.
Material and Methods. Preoperative, anatomic (T1- and T2-weighted), and LINESCAN diffusion tensor MRI were obtained in 12 patients harboring supratentorial gliomas (World Health Organization WHO Grades II and III). The two imaging modalities were rigidly registered. The tumors were manually segmented from the T1- and T2-weighted MRI, and their volume calculated. A three-dimensional tractography was performed in each case. A second segmentation and volume measurement was performed on the tumor regions intersecting adjacent white matter fiber tracts. Statistical methods included summary statistics to examine the fraction of tumor volume infiltrating adjacent white matter.; Results. There were five patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade II), one with low-grade mixed oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade II), one with ganglioglioma, two with low-grade astrocytoma (WHO Grade II), and three with anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). We identified white matter tracts infiltrated by tumor in all 12 cases. The median tumor volume (+- standard deviation) in our patient population was 42.5 +- 28.9 mL. The median tumor volume (+- standard deviation) infiltrating white matter fiber tracts was 5.2 +- 9.9 mL. The median percentage of tumor volume infiltrating white matter fiber tracts was 21.4% +- 9.7%.; Conclusions. The information provided by diffusion tensor imaging combined with anatomic MRI might be useful for neurosurgical planning and intraoperative guidance. Our results confirm previous reports that extensive white matter infiltration by primary brain tumors is a common occurrence. However, prospective, large population studies are required to definitively clarify this issue, and how infiltration relates to histologic tumor type, tumor size, and location.

N2  -  Aim. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) in brain tumors.
Methods. Fifteen patients with 18 metastatic brain lesions underwent gadolinium-enhanced fast spoiled gradient echo (Gd-FSPGR), DWI with ADC maps, and F-18FDG PET. Spherical three-dimensional tumor and contralateral control regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on Gd-FSPGR, ADC and PET images, Gd-FSPGR being the target for statistical parametric mapping with realigned ADC and PET to calculate ROI ratios; linear regression analysis was performed.; Results. An inverse correlation (r(2)=0.2746, P=0.0256) was found between PET and ADC ratios; plotting ratios: when PET ratios were high, ADC ratios were low, while, when ADC ratios were high, PET ratios were low.; Conclusion. Our preliminary data suggest an inverse relationship between PET and ADC indices. Hypercellular areas could increase impedance to water diffusion, resulting in low ADC values and high F-18FDG uptake, while lower cellularity areas show increased ADC with decreased F-18FDG uptake.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP) is an animal model for a complex form of cerebrovascular pathology. MRI provides an efficient and noninvasive tool for studying the time course of brain damage. The aim of this study was to gain new insights into the pathological phenomena responsible for the occurrence of brain injury in SHRSP with the use of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC), one of the most efficient MRI parameters for detecting brain abnormalities. To this end, the pattern of ADC variation observed in SHRSP was compared with that of focal ischemia induced in both SHRSP and Sprague-Dawley rats.
Methods-Four groups of animals were studied: SHRSP developing spontaneous brain lesions fed with a salt-loaded (n = 15, group 1) or standard diet (n = 3, group 2) and Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8, group 3) and SHRSP (n = 8, group 4) with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. ADC maps and T2-weighted images of brains were performed by MRI. After the rats were killed, the brains were removed and histologically processed.; Results-There was no decrease in ADC during spontaneous stroke in the SHRSP fed with a normal or salt-enriched diet, while both the SHRSP and Sprague-Dawley rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion showed a marked decrease that lasted for 24 to 48 hours.; Conclusions-Cerebral ischemia cannot be considered a major factor in the onset of spontaneous brain lesions in SHRSP, which show only vasogenic edema after the beginning of the damage with no evidence of metabolic impairment.

N2  -  AIM:To investigate the outcome of glioma resection surgery and changes of pyramidal tract (PT) for patients where PT is immediately adjacent to the tumors, which were revealed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based fiber tracking (FT) technique.
MATERIAL and METHODS: 40 patients enrolled. Preoperative and intraoperative tractography of the PT was performed before and after glioma resection. Motor function was recorded before surgery and 1 week, three to six months after surgery. Distances (D) between intraoperative tractography of the PT and the resection cavity were measured.; RESULTS: 14 patients had transient aggravated or newly motor deficits 1 week after surgery. After 3 to 6 months follow up, only 3 (7.5%) patients had permanent deficits. In 12 (30%) patients, the intraoperative PT tractogram adjoined the resection cavity after tumor removal (D=0). They all had transient aggravated motor deficits after surgery and 3 were permanent. In 19 patients with preoperative motor deficits, 11 (57.90%) had zero D value. In other 21 patients, 1 (4.76%) had zero D value. There was significant difference between these two ratio (p<0.01).; CONCLUSION: DTI based FT is helpful in protection for the PT during glioma surgery, even if the PT is directly adjacent to the glioma. Patients with preoperative motor deficits faced more risk of persistent aggravated deficits after surgery.

N2  -  Purpose: To differentiate fibroblastic meningiomas, usually considered to be of a hard consistency, from other benign subtypes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Materials and Methods: From DTI data sets of 30 patients with benign meningiomas, we calculated diffusion tensors and mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps as well as barycentric maps representing the geometrical shape of the tensors. The findings were compared to postoperative histology. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was given by the patients.; Results: According to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), FA was the best parameter to differentiate between the subtypes (F = 32.2; p < 0.0001). Regarding tensor shape, endothelial meningiomas were represented by spherical tensors (80%) corresponding to isotropic diffusion, whereas the fibroblastic meningiomas showed a high percentage (43%) of nonspherical tensors, indicating planar or longitudinal diffusion. The difference was highly significant (F = 28.4; p < 0.0001) and may be due to the fascicular arrangement of long spindle-shaped tumor cells and the high content of intra- and interfascicular fibers as shown in the histology. In addition, a capsule-like rim of the in-plane diffusion surrounded most meningiomas irrespective of their histological type.; Conclusion: If these results correlate to the intraoperative findings of meningioma. consistency, DTI-based measurement of FA and analysis of the shape of the diffusion tensor is a promising method to differentiate between fibroblastic and other subtypes of benign meningiomas in order to get information about their "hard" or "soft" consistency prior to removal.

N2  -  Objective A subset of patients with malignant glioma comes to medical attention before their masses show rim enhancement and central necrosis. Tumors in those cases are frequently located in eloquent areas of the brain. Tissue diagnosis is limited to stereotactic biopsy providing limited material for accurate grading. We conducted this study to determine whether imaging characteristics of early stages of malignant gliomas could aid in timely definitive diagnosis.
Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma seen at the Yale Brain Tumor Center between 2002 and 2005. Patients with typical radiographic presentation were excluded.; Results Of 89 patients, eight meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. In five patients, patchy or small nodular enhancing lesions without central necrosis were present within the tumor mass. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed areas of increased signal intensity in all cases. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) revealed low-signal intensity in corresponding areas. At the time of imaging, biopsy was performed in seven patients but diagnosis of malignant glioma could only be established prior to further tumor growth in four cases.; Conclusions The diagnosis in the early stages of malignant glioma can be challenging in a subset of cases. Information obtained through DWI should be incorporated in the clinical decision-making process. Mass lesions displaying decreased water diffusion indicating high cellularity, are suggestive of a high-grade glioma. Biopsies are recommended. However, even when biopsies are inconclusive, a strong suspicion of malignant glioma should be considered.

N2  -  AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in characterizing cerebral. cystic lesions. The usefulness of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map in lesion characterization was also evaluated.
METHODS: We compared the findings of conventional MR images with those of DWI: 63 cystic masses in 48 patients were examined with routine MR imaging and echo-planar DWI. The routine MR imaging included at least the axial T2- and T1-weighted sequences, and post-contrast T1 axial sequences. The DWI included an echo-planar spin-echo sequence with three values (0, 500 and 1000 smm(2)) sensitizing gradient in the x, y, z direction, and it obtained an ADC map.; RESULTS: The sensitivity of DWI for differentiating abscesses from primary brain tumours was 100%; for differentiating abscesses from metastatic tumours was 73%; for differentiating benign from malignant lesions was 90%.; CONCLUSION: Although some metastatic lesions may appear hyperintense on DWI thus imitating an abscess, evaluation of the Lesions with both DWI and conventional MRI may have an important contribution to the differentiation of tumours from abscesses.

N2  -  THE role of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with brain tumours remains poorly understood. In this study the self-diffusion parameters of extracellular water within primary intracranial tumours and peritumoural tissue, and their response to dexamethasone, have been measured using MR diffusion tensor imaging. Maps of the mean diffusivity <D> and two measures of diffusion anisotropy were obtained from six patients before, and typically 48-72 h after, commencing dexamethasone treatment. A significant decrease in <D> of either tumour (p<0.02) or oedematous brain (p<0.04) was observed in three patients. No significant changes were noted in either of the two calculated diffusion anisotropy indices before and after steroid treatment in any of the six patients.

N2  -  Introduction. The diagnosis of a cerebral abscess is a veal challenge since the clinical and radiological findings are often non-specific and undistinguishable from those seen with cystic or necrotic tumours. Recently it has been suggested that diffusion sequences may be useful in the differential diagnosis of a necrotic or cystic mass. Patients and methods. Nine patients with cystic or necrotic intracranial masses were studied. The diagnoses were: three pyogenic abscesses, three metastases and three high grade gliomas. The diffusion images were evaluated visually and by means of maps based on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Results. All lesions showed fine iso-intense or slightly hyperintense walls in T-1 potentiated sequences, and isointense or slightly hypointense walls in T-2 potentiated sequences. In all cases the wall took up gadolinium intensity with a well-defined smooth edge (ring uptake). In the diffusion sequences the abscesses showed a very strong central signal, as compared with the low signal of other lesions. The ADC were significantly lower in the abscesses than in the tumours. Conclusions. Since cerebral abscesses are potentially curable, early diagnosis should be made. A cerebral abscess should be suspected in all cases of cystic or necrotic masses with hypersignals in diffusion sequences and low ADC.

N2  -  Object. Resecting brain tumors involves the risk of damaging the descending motor pathway. Diffusion tensor (DT)-imaged fiber tracking is a noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) technique that can delineate the subcortical course of the motor pathway. The goal of this study was to use intraoperative subcortical stimulation mapping of the motor tract and magnetic source imaging to validate the utility of DT-imaged fiber tracking as a tool for presurgical planning.
Methods. Diffusion tensor-imaged fiber tracks of the motor tract were generated preoperatively in nine patients with gliomas. A mask of the resultant fiber tracks was overlaid on high-resolution T1- and T2-weighted anatomical MR images and used for stereotactic surgical navigation. Magnetic source imaging was performed in seven of the patients to identify functional somatosensory cortices. During resection, subcortical stimulation mapping of the motor pathway was performed within the white matter using a bipolar electrode.; Results. A total of 16 subcortical motor stimulations were stereotactically identified in nine patients. The mean distance between the stimulation sites and the DT-imaged fiber tracks was 8.7 +- 3.1 mm (+- standard deviation). The measured distance between subcortical stimulation sites and DT-imaged fiber tracks combines tracking technique errors and all errors encountered with stereotactic navigation.; Conclusions. Fiber tracks delineated using DT imaging can be used to identify the motor tract in deep white matter and define safety margin around the tract.

N2  -  To investigate the application value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the difference of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(difference)) value calculated from ADC(difference) map was used, in evaluating the pathologic grade of astrocytic tumors.
33 patients with histopathologically proven supratentorial astrocytic tumors were included in this prospective study. All of them received conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DWI with diffusion factor of 0 and 50 smm(2) and of 0 and 3,000 smm(2), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) examinations. Pseudo-color ADC(difference) maps were obtained by means of using ADC map with low b value (0 and 50 smm(2)) minus ADC map with high b value (0 and 3,000 smm(2)).; The highest ADC(difference) value of grades I-II, grade III, and grade IV was (0.91 +- 0.07) x 10(-3), (1.81 +- 0.38) x 10(-3), and (2.36 +- 0.32) x 10(-3) mm(2)s, respectively, and there was statistical difference among them (p < 0.001). The highest ADC(difference) value between low-grade (grades I-II) and high-grade (grades III-IV) astrocytic tumors showed statistical difference as well (p < 0.001). The highest ADC(difference) value of astrocytic tumors correlated positively with the pathologic grade of tumor (r = 0.853, p < 0.001). Positive correlation was found between the highest ADC(difference) value and maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) value (r = 0.829, p < 0.001) in high-grade astrocytic tumors; however, the highest ADC(difference) value and maximum rCBV value had no significant correlation in low-grade astrocytic tumors (r = 0.259, p = 0.536).; Quantitative analysis of highest ADC(difference) value of supratentorial astrocytic tumors may provide valuable information of tumor microcirculation and perfusion, thus allowing a promising new method for preoperatively assessing the pathologic grade of tumor.

N2  -  The neural substrate underlying cognitive impairments after chemotherapy is largely unknown. Here, we investigated very late (>9 years) effects of adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy on brain white and gray matter in primary breast cancer survivors (n = 17) with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A group of breast cancer survivors who did not receive chemotherapy was scanned for comparison (n = 15). Neuropsychological tests demonstrated cognitive impairments in the chemotherapy group. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tract-based spatial statistics showed that chemotherapy was associated with focal changes in DTI values indicative for reduced white matter integrity. Single voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the left centrum semiovale (white matter) showed a reduction of N-acetylasparate/creatine indicative of axonal injury. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated a reduction of gray matter volume that overlapped with fMRI hypoactivation (as reported in a previous publication) in posterior parietal areas and colocalized with DTI abnormalities. Also, DTI correlated with 1H-MRS only in the chemotherapy group. These results converge to suggest that high-dose adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with long-term injury to white matter, presumably reflecting a combination of axonal degeneration and demyelination, and damage to gray matter with associated functional deficits. Hormonal treatment with tamoxifen may also have contributed to the observed effects, although results from other studies indicate that it is unlikely that tamoxifen is solely or largely responsible. Using this multimodality approach we provide for the first time insight into the neural substrate underlying cognitive impairments following systemic administration of cytotoxic agents many years after treatment.

Multidimensional parameter combinations improved differentiation between different tissues, However, the three tumor types could not be differentiated, All parameter maps allowed the identification of the whole tumor-edema area, On T-2, images, edema could be identified best, whereas the tumor itself was hardly visualized, In many cases, tumor presentation using T-1, maps corresponded best with histology, nevertheless suffering from a poor tumor-edema differentiation.

N2  -  Background
The resection of a motor-eloquent glioma should be guided by intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) but its interpretation is often difficult and may (unnecessarily) lead to subtotal resection. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) is able to stratify patients with motor-eloquent lesion preoperatively into high- and low-risk cases with respect to a new motor deficit.; Objective; To analyze to what extent preoperative nTMS motor risk stratification can improve the interpretation of IOM phenomena.; Methods; In this monocentric observational study, nTMS motor mapping with DTI fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract was performed before IOM-guided surgery for motor-eloquent gliomas in a prospectively collected cohort from January 2017 to October 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed considering nTMS data (motor cortex infiltration, resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, latency) and IOM data (transcranial MEP monitoring, intensity of monopolar subcortical stimulation (SCS), somatosensory evoked potentials) to examine the association with the postoperative motor outcome (assessed at day of discharge and at 3 months).; Results; Thirty-seven (56.1%) of 66 patients (27 female) with a median age of 48 years had tumors located in the right hemisphere, with glioblastoma being the most common diagnosis with 39 cases (59.1%). Three patients (4.9%) had a new motor deficit that recovered partially within 3 months and 6 patients had a persistent deterioration (9.8%). The more risk factors of the nTMS risk stratification model (motor cortex infiltration, tumor-tract distance (TTD) <= 8mm, RMTratio 110%) were detected, the higher was the risk for developing a new postoperative motor deficit, whereas no patient with a TTD >8mm deteriorated. Irreversible MEP amplitude decrease >50% was associated with worse motor outcome in all patients, while a MEP amplitude decrease <= 50% or lower SCS intensities <= 4mA were particularly correlated with a postoperative worsened motor status in nTMS-stratified high-risk cases. No patient had postoperative deterioration of motor function (except one with partial recovery) when intraoperative MEPs remained stable or showed only reversible alterations.; Conclusions; The preoperative nTMS-based risk assessment can help to interpret ambiguous IOM phenomena (such as irreversible MEP amplitude decrease <= 50%) and adjustment of SCS stimulation intensity.

N2  -  We compared characteristic features in ischemic stroke lesions from the hyperacute to the chronic stage on diffusion-weighted (DW) and magnetization transfer (MT) images with those on T2-weighted (T2W) images, and assessed changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MT effect (MTe), and T2 ratios (infarct/normal) over time. DW images were particularly useful for detecting hyperacute infarcts within 6 hours of onset and in distinguishing acute lesions from chronic lesions, ADC ratios were lower within 7 days after onset and rose toward 1.0 in the subacute phase, becoming relatively isotense on ADC maps, but elevated thereafter. Although MTe ratios were unchanged or only subtly changed in the acute stage, they became significantly lower in the subacute and chronic stages. These combined magnetic resonance (MR) techniques were useful in the assessment of ischemic stroke and facilitated the determination of the age of cerebral infarct.

N2  -  This review explores how the integration of advanced imaging methods with high-quality anatomical images significantly improves the characterization, target definition, assessment of response to therapy, and overall management of patients with high-grade glioma. Metrics derived from diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, allows us to characterize regions of edema, hypoxia, increased cellularity, and necrosis within heterogeneous tumor and surrounding brain tissue. Quantification of such measures may provide a more reliable initial representation of tumor delineation and response to therapy than changes in the contrast-enhancing or T2 lesion alone and have a significant effect on targeting resection, planning radiation, and assessing treatment effectiveness. In the long term, implementation of these imaging methodologies can also aid in the identification of recurrent tumor and its differentiation from treatment-related confounds and facilitate the detection of radiation-induced vascular injury in otherwise normal-appearing brain tissue.

N2  -  Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has been recently introduced as a novel MRI post-processing technique of gradient recalled echo (GRE) data. QSM is useful in depicting both brain anatomy and for detecting abnormalities. Its utility in the context of ischemic stroke has, however, not been extensively characterized so far. In this study, we explored the potential of QSM to characterize vascular and tissue changes in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model of cerebral ischemia. We acquired GRE data of mice brains at different time points after tMCAO, from which we computed QSM and MR frequency maps, and compared these maps with diffusion imaging and multi-slice multi-echo imaging data acquired in the same animals. Prominent vessels with increased magnetic susceptibility were visible surrounding the lesion on both frequency and magnetic susceptibility maps at all time points (mostly visible at > 12 h after reperfusion). Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of compressed capillaries and dilated larger vessels, suggesting that the appearance of prominent vessels after reestablishment of reperfusion may serve compensatory purposes. In addition, on both contrast maps, tissue regions of decreased magnetic susceptibility were observed at 24 and 48 h after reperfusion that were distinctly different from the lesions seen on maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient and T (2) relaxation time constant. Since QSM can be extracted as an add-on from GRE data and thus requires no additional acquisition time in the course of acute stroke MRI examination, it may provide unique and complementary information during the course of acute stroke MRI examinations.

N2  -  External decompression can be an effective treatment for acute intracranial hypertension, but the cranial defect must be repaired. The most serious complication of cranioplasty is late infection. Confusing an empyema that occurs after cranioplasty with a fluid collection (haematoma or liquor) can have catastrophic consequences, such as the development of cerebritis. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose empyema after cranioplasty. DW MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were studied in six patients with surgically verified empyema after cranioplasty. The findings were compared with those in five patients who had surgically verified haematoma or liquorrhoea. In the patients with empyema, the lesion was hyperintense, whereas the fluid collections (haematoma and liquorrhoea) were visualized as hypointense lesions. The ADC maps showed that empyema had a significantly lower intensity than the fluid collections (haematoma or liquorrhoea). DW MRI can be used to identify empyema after cranioplasty and can help to differentiate it from other fluid collections. Hence, this is a useful additional imaging modality for the diagnosis of empyema after cranioplasty.

N2  -  This study examined the relationship between magnetic resonance diffusion imaging and autoradiographic markers of cerebral blood flow ((99m)Tc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime) and cerebral hypoxia ((125)I-iodoazomycin arabinoside) in a rat model of stroke. Middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat was performed using an intraluminal suture approach. Diffusion, hypoxia, and blood flow maps were acquired 2 hr following occlusion, and were compared with T2 images and histology at 7 hr, Two hours following middle cerebral artery occlusion the lesion distributions from the diffusion maps and hypoxic autoradiographs were similar. The blood flow threshold for increased uptake of the hypoxic marker was approximately 34 +/- 7% of the normal flow. The combination of diffusion or hypoxic images with perfusion maps allowed differentiation between four regions: 1) normal tissue; 2) a region of decreased perfusion but normal diffusion and normal uptake of hypoxic marker; 3) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and increased uptake of hypoxic marker; 4) a region of decreased perfusion, decreased diffusion and low uptake of hypoxic marker. The areas for increased uptake of hypoxic marker and decreased diffusion are equivalent, indicating similar blood flow thresholds. Regions of oligaemic misery perfusion, ischaemic misery perfusion and lesion core may be delineated with the combination of diffusion or hypoxic images and perfusion maps. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T2  -  BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION

N2  -  Bipolar direct electrical stimulation (DES) of an awake patient is the reference technique for identifying brain structures to achieve maximal safe tumor resection. Unfortunately, DES cannot be performed in all cases. Alternative surgical tools are, therefore, needed to aid identification of subcortical connectivity during brain tumor removal. In this pilot study, we sought to (i) evaluate the combined use of evoked potential (EP) and tractography for identification of white matter (WM) tracts under the functional control of DES, and (ii) provide clues to the electrophysiological effects of bipolar stimulation on neural pathways. We included 12 patients (mean age of 38.4 years) who had had a dMRI-based tractography and a functional brain mapping under awake craniotomy for brain tumor removal. Electrophysiological recordings of subcortical evoked potentials (SCEPs) were acquired during bipolar low frequency (2 Hz) stimulation of the WM functional sites identified during brain mapping. SCEPs were successfully triggered in 11 out of 12 patients. The median length of the stimulated fibers was 43.24 +/- 19.55 mm, belonging to tracts of median lengths of 89.84 +/- 24.65 mm. The electrophysiological (delay, amplitude, and speed of propagation) and structural (number and lengths of streamlines, and mean fractional anisotropy) measures were correlated. In our experimental conditions, SCEPs were essentially limited to a subpart of the bundles, suggesting a selectivity of action of the DES on the brain networks. Correlations between functional, structural, and electrophysiological measures portend the combined use of EPs and tractography as a potential intraoperative tool to achieve maximum safe resection in brain tumor surgery.

N2  -  Purpose: To assess the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and correlate MRI findings with carboxyhemoglobin levels.
Materials and methods: The MRI examinations and medical records of seven men with a mean age of 43 +- 16.0 years (SD) (range: 25-63 years) with acute CO poisoning were reviewed. MRI examinations were analyzed with respect to lesion location, imaging presentation on T1- and T2-weighted images, and diffusion characteristics on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. We also evaluated clinical features and laboratory findings including the presenting symptoms and signs, carboxyhemoglobin level, and treatment.; Results: All seven patients presented with mental status change. The level of carboxyhemoglobin ranged between 8.3% and 34.8% (normal < 1.5%). All seven patients (77, 100%) showed restricted diffusion of the lesions on ADC maps and bilateral involvement of globus pallidus. The mean ratios of ADC values was 0.63 +- 0.15 (SD) (range: 0.46-0.92) on bilateral globi pallidi. Cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, splenium of corpus callosum, midbrain and insula were also involved.; Conclusion: Bilateral globi pallidi with restricted diffusion may be a characteristic MRI feature in patients with acute CO poisoning. However, the relationship was not certain between the carboxyhemoglobin levels and the variety or severity of MRI findings. (C) 2016 Editions francaises de radiologie.

N2  -  Background
Thrombolytic treatment for acute stroke has focused attention on accurate identification of injured vs. salvageable brain tissue, particularly if reperfusion occurs. However, our knowledge of differences in acute magnetic resonance imaging changes between transient and permanent ischemia and how they reflect permanently damaged tissue remain incomplete.; Aims andor hypothesis; Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics vary widely following ischemia and, at acute times, T-1, T-2 or apparent diffusion coefficient quantification may differentiate viable tissue from that destined to infarct.; Methods; High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 9 center dot 4 T following permanent or transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive male rats or Wistar rats. Within 30 min, quantified maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient, T-1, and T-2 were performed and measures determined for sequences in the infarct and compared with that in the contralateral region. Lesion area for each magnetic resonance imaging sequence (T-1, T-2, apparent diffusion coefficient, and perfusion maps) was delineated for different time points using quantitative threshold measures and compared with final histological damage.; Results; Early extensive changes in T-1 following both transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion provided a sensitive early indicator of the final infarct area. Following reperfusion, small but measurable early T-2 changes indicative of early development of vasogenic edema occurred in the transient but not permanent groups. In transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, at 70 min apparent diffusion coefficient decreased (P < 0 center dot 001) and then pseudonormalized at 150 min. In permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, apparent diffusion coefficient declined over time. Lesion area detected using T-1 maps exceeded that with T-2 and apparent diffusion coefficient at 70 and 150 min in both groups (P < 0 center dot 001).; Conclusions; The results indicate that, independent of reperfusion, quantified T-1 is superior for detecting early ischemic changes that are not necessarily detected with T-2 or apparent diffusion coefficient.

N2  -  This study describes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and changes in lateral ventricular size over time in a canine ischemic stroke model. T1-and T2-weighted (T1W, T2W) imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence MRI were performed at 3 h and 3, 8, and 35 days after brain infarct induction. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping were performed at 8 and 35 days. A total of 29 brain lesions were induced successfully in 12 of 14 beagle dogs. At 3 h, T2W and FLAIR detected hyperintense lesions in three randomly selected dogs. On T1W, all lesions appeared hypointense to isointense at 3 h, isointense (18/29) or hypointense (11/29) at 3 days, hypointense to isointense with peripheral hyperintensity (24/26) at 8 days, and hypointense (18/26) at 35 days. Infarcts on DWI/ADC were hypointense to isointense centrally, with the periphery hyperintense/hyperintense (17/26) at 8 days and hypointense/hyperintense (19/26) at 35 days. A marked increase in lateral ventricular size was observed in dogs with cerebral infarcts. In conclusion, T2W and FLAIR were useful for detecting early stage (3 h to 3 days) brain infarction. T1W and DWI were useful for detecting neuronal necrosis and providing supplemental information for phase evaluation.

N2  -  Background To compare the diagnostic performance of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), mean apparent propagator magnetic resonance imaging (MAP-MRI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in distinguishing high-grade gliomas (HGGs) from solitary brain metastases (SBMs). Methods Patients with previously untreated, histopathologically confirmed HGGs (n = 20) or SBMs (n = 21) appearing as a solitary and contrast-enhancing lesion on structural MRI were prospectively recruited to undergo diffusion-weighted MRI. DWI data were obtained using a q-space Cartesian grid sampling procedure and were processed to generate parametric maps by fitting the NODDI, MAP-MRI, DKI, DTI and DWI models. The diffusion metrics of the contrast-enhancing tumor and peritumoral edema were measured. Differences in the diffusion metrics were compared between HGGs and SBMs, followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the Hanley and McNeill test to determine their diagnostic performances. Results NODDI-based isotropic volume fraction (V-iso) and orientation dispersion index (ODI); MAP-MRI-based mean-squared displacement (MSD) and q-space inverse variance (QIV); DKI-generated radial, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (RDk, MDk and FA(k)); and DTI-generated radial, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (RD, MD and FA) of the contrast-enhancing tumor were significantly different between HGGs and SBMs (p < 0.05). The best single discriminative parameters of each model were V-iso, MSD, RDk and RD for NODDI, MAP-MRI, DKI and DTI, respectively. The AUC of V-iso (0.871) was significantly higher than that of MSD (0.736), RDk (0.760) and RD (0.733) (p < 0.05). Conclusion NODDI outperforms MAP-MRI, DKI, DTI and DWI in differentiating between HGGs and SBMs. NODDI-based V-iso has the highest performance.

N2  -  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the commonest primary malignant brain tumor in adults, and despite advances in multimodality therapy, the outlook for patients has changed little in the last 10 years. Local recurrence is the predominant pattern of treatment failure, hence improved local therapies (surgery and radiotherapy) are needed to improve patient outcomes. Currently segmentation of GBM for surgery or radiotherapy (RT) planning is labor intensive, especially for high-dimensional MR imaging methods that may provide more sensitive indicators of tumor phenotype. Automating processing and segmentation of these images will aid treatment planning. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is a recently developed technique (DTI) that is exquisitely sensitive to the ordered diffusion of water in white matter tracts. Our group has shown that decomposition of the tensor information into the isotropic component (p - shown to represent tumor invasion) and the anisotropic component (q - shown to represent the tumor bulk) can provide valuable prognostic information regarding tumor infiltration and patient survival. However, tensor decomposition of DTI data is not commonly used for neurosurgery or radiotherapy treatment planning due to difficulties in segmenting the resultant image maps. For this reason, automated techniques for segmentation of tensor decomposition maps would have significant clinical utility. In this paper, we modified a well-established convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) for medical image segmentation and used it as an automatic multi-sequence GBM segmentation based on both DTI image maps (p and q maps) and conventional MRI sequences (T2-FLAIR and T1 weighted post contrast (T1c)). In this proof-of-concept work, we have used multiple MRI sequences, each with individually defined ground truths for better understanding of the contribution of each image sequence to the segmentation performance. The high accuracy and efficiency of our proposed model demonstrates the potential of utilizing diffusion MR images for target definition in precision radiation treatment planning and surgery in routine clinical practice.

N2  -  Purpose: Previous studies on intracranial tumors indicate that a high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is due to low cellularity and that lower values indicate a dense, highly cellular tumor. Diffusion is affected by three major factors: cell density, existence and distribution of vasogenic edema, and hypoxic tissue. Therefore, we studied the characteristics of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in a rat brain C6 glioma during tumor progression. Materials and Methods: In male Wistar rats, C6 gliomas were implanted in the caudoputamen. At day 9, 11, 13 and 15 after tumor inoculation, conventional DWI was performed on a 2.35 Tesla small bore MRI unit (Biospec 24/40, BRUKER Medizintechnik, Ettlingen, Germany). Results: On conventional T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, all tumors could well be delineated from the surrounding brain tissue and showed significant progression. On DWI, the tumors were isointense or slightly hypointense compared to the surrounding brain. On the ADC maps, the tumors could be well visualized due to increasing ADC values from day 9 to 15. The mean ADC of brain tumor tissue was 0.76 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) MM2/s at day 9 and 0.91 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) MM2/S at day 15. The mean ADC of the normal contralateral caudoputamen was 0.59 +/- 0.007x 10(-3)MM(2/)s. Conclusion: T2 prolongation and increased water diffusion can be balanced on DWI in C6 gliomas, resulting in iso-intensity on DWI (T2 shine-through washout phenomenon). ADC maps are indispensable for the correct interpretation of tumor tissue diffusion behavior.

N2  -  The recently developed oscillating-gradient diffusion MRI (OG-dMRI) technique extends our ability to examine brain structures at different spatial scales. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of OG-dMRI in detecting cellular and subcellular structural changes in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI). Neonatal mice received unilateral HI injury or sham injury at postnatal day 10, followed by in vivo T-2-weighted and diffusion MRI of the brains at 3-6 h and 24 h after HI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were acquired using conventional pulsed-gradient dMRI (PG-dMRI) and OG-dMRI with oscillating frequencies from 50 to 200 Hz. Pathology at cellular and subcellular levels was evaluated using neuronal, glial, and mitochondrial markers. We found significantly higher rates of ADC increase with oscillating frequencies (Delta(f)ADC) in the ipsilateral edema region, compared to the contralateral side, starting as early as 3 h after HI. Even in injured regions that showed no apparent change in PG-ADC or pseudo-normalized PG-ADC measurements, Delta(f)ADC remained significantly elevated. Histopathology showed swelling of sub-cellular structures in these regions with no apparent whole-cell level change. These results suggest that OG-dMRI is sensitive to subcellular structural changes in the brain after HI and is less susceptible to pseudo-normalization than PG-dMRI.

N2  -  Purpose: To longitudinally investigate stroke in rats after photothrombotic occlusion of proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in correlation with histopathology.
Materials and methods: Forty-two rats were subjected to photochemical MCA occlusion and MRI at 1.5 T, and sacrificed in seven groups (n = 6 each) at the following time points: 1, 3, 6 and 12 h, and at day 1, 3 and 9. T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was performed in all rats. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) was compared to intravital staining with Evans blue in one group for assessing blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. The brain was stained histochemically with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and processed for pathological assessment. The evolutional changes of relative lesion volume, signal intensity (SI), and the BBB integrity on MRI with corresponding histopathology were evaluated.; Results: The ischemic lesion volume reached a maximum around 12 h to day 1 as visualized successively by DWI, ADC map and T2WI, implicating the evolving pathology from cytotoxic edema through vasogenic edema to tissue death. The ADC of brain infarction underwent a significant reversion after 12 h, reflecting the colliquative necrosis. On CE-T1WI, BBB leakage peaked at 6 h and at day 3 with a transitional partial recovery around 24 h. The infarct volume on T2WI, DWI and ADC map matched well with that on TTC staining at 12 h and at day 1 (p > 0.05).; Conclusion: The evolution of the present photothrombotic stroke model in rats could be characterized by MRI. The obtained information may help longitudinal studies of cerebral ischemia and anti-stroke agents using the same model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Imaging techniques are important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up of patients with gliomas. T1-weighted MRI, with or without gadolinium, is the gold standard method. However, this technique only reflects biological activity of the tumour indirectly by detecting the breakdown of the blood brain barrier. Therefore, especially for low-grade glioma or after treatment, T1-weighted MRI enhanced with gadolinium has substantial limitations. Development of more advanced imaging methods to improve outcomes for individual patients is needed. New imaging methods based on Mill and PET can be employed in various stages of disease to target the biological activity of the tumour cells (eg, increased uptake of aminoacids or nucleoside analogues), the changes in diffusivity through the interstitial space (diffusion-weighted MRI), the tumour-induced neovascularisation (perfusion-weighted MRI or contrast-enhanced MRI, or increased uptake of aminoacids in endothelial wall), and the changes in concentrations of metabolites (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). These techniques have advantages and disadvantages, and should be used in conjunction to best help individual patients. Advanced imaging techniques need to be validated in clinical trials to ensure standardisation and evidence-based implementation in routine clinical practice.

N2  -  In motor functional neurological disorders (mFND), relationships between interoception (a construct of high theoretical relevance to its pathophysiology) and neuroanatomy have not been previously investigated. This study characterized white matter in mFND patients compared to healthy controls (HCs), and investigated associations between fiber bundle integrity and cardiac interoception. Voxel-based analysis and tractography quantified fractional anisotropy (FA) in 38 mFND patients compared to 38 HCs. Secondary analyses compared functional seizures (FND-seiz; n = 21) or functional movement disorders (n = 17) to HCs. Network lesion mapping identified gray matter origins of implicated fiber bundles. Within-group mFND analyses investigated relationships between FA, heartbeat tracking accuracy and interoceptive trait prediction error (discrepancies between interoceptive accuracy and self-reported bodily awareness). Results were corrected for multiple comparisons, and all findings were adjusted for depression and trait anxiety. mFND and HCs did not show any between-group interoceptive accuracy or FA differences. However, the FND-seiz subgroup compared to HCs showed decreased integrity in right-lateralized tracts: extreme capsule/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and thalamic/striatum to occipital cortex projections. These alterations originated predominantly from the right temporoparietal junction and inferior temporal gyrus. In mFND patients, individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive trait prediction error correlated with fiber bundle integrity originating from the insula, temporoparietal junction, putamen and thalamus among other regions. In this first study investigating brain-interoception relationships in mFND, individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and trait prediction error mapped onto multimodal integration-related fiber bundles. Right-lateralized limbic and associative tract disruptions distinguished FND-seiz from HCs.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of intra-axial tumors is a challenging procedure because of indistinct tumor margins, infiltration, and displacement of white matter tracts surrounding the lesion. Hence, gross total tumor resection without causing new neurologic deficits is demanding, especially in tumor sites adjoining eloquent structures. Feasibility of the combination of navigated probabilistic fiber tracking to identify eloquent fiber pathways and navigated ultrasonography to control brain shift was tested.
METHODS: Eleven patients with lesions adjacent to eloquent white matter structures (pyramidal tract, optic radiation and arcuate fascicle) were preoperatively subjected to magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging on a 3-T magnetic resonance system (Trio Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Probabilistic fiber tracking was performed using the tools of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). Results of probabilistic fiber tracking and high-resolution anatomic images were integrated into the neuronavigation system Stealth Station (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) together with the navigated ultrasonography (SonoNav Medtronic).; RESULTS: FSL-based probabilistic fiber tracking depicted the pyramidal tract, the optic radiation, and arcuate fascicle anatomically plausibly. Integration of the probabilistic fiber tracking into neuronavigation was technically feasible and allowed visualization of the reconstructed fiber pathways. Navigated ultrasonography controlled brain shift.; CONCLUSIONS: Integration of probabilistic fiber tracking and navigated ultrasonography into intraoperative neuronavigation facilitated anatomic orientation during glioma resection. FSL-based probabilistic fiber tracking integrated sophisticated fiber tracking algorithms, including modeling of crossing fibers. Combination with navigated ultrasonography provided a three-dimensional estimation of intraoperative brain shift and, therefore, improved the reliability of neuronavigation.

N2  -  Optic nerve hemangioblastoma is a very rare benign tumor with only 39 reported cases by now. It appears to be hyperintense on T2-weighted images with a significant enhancement on contrast scans, which are similar to glioma and meningioma. Due to the lack of specificity in MRI manifestations, optic nerve hemangioblastoma is often misdiagnosed. To provide new insights into differential diagnosis of optic nerve hemangioblastoma, we report for the first time an optic nerve hemangioblastoma case employing advanced magnetic resonance techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). In addition, we have collected all reported optic nerve hemangioblastoma cases and reviewed their neuroimaging findings by MRI and angiography. Our results show that solid-type tumor is the dominant form of optic nerve hemangioblastoma and extensive edema is widely observed. These findings are surprisingly contrary to manifestations of cerebellar hemangioblastoma. Besides the structural features, quantitative indexes including ADC and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratio, which are significantly elevated in cerebellar hemangioblastoma, may also shed a light on the preoperative diagnosis of hemangioblastoma of optic nerve. Finally, we discuss the critical neuroimaging features in the differential diagnosis between optic nerve hemangioblastoma from optic pathway glioma and optic nerve sheath meningioma.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a machine learning method based on texture features in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from a primary cerebral nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).
Materials and methods: We included 70 patients who underwent contrast enhanced brain MRI at 3 T with brain tumors diagnosed as GBM (n= 45) and PCNSL (n= 25) in this retrospective study. Twelve histograms and texture parameters were assessed on T2-weighted images (T2WIs), apparent diffusion coefficient maps, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WIs). A prediction model was developed using a machine learning method (univariate logistic regression and multivariate eXtreme gradient boosting-XGBoost) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of this model was calculated via 10-fold cross validation. In addition, the performance of the machine learning method was compared with the judgments of two board certified radiologists.; Results: With the univariate logistic regression model, the standard deviation of rCBV offered the highest AUC (0.86), followed by mean value of rCBV (0.83), skewness of CE-T1WI (0.78), mean value of CET1 (0.78), and max value of rCBV (0.77). The AUC of the XGBoost was significantly higher than the two radiologists (0.98 vs. 0.84; p < 0.01 and 0.98 vs. 0.79; p < 0.01, respectively).; Conclusion: The performance of machine learning based on histogram and texture features in multi-parametric MRI was superior to that of conventional cut-off method and the board certified radiologists to differentiate a GBM from a PCNSL.

T2  -  SEMINARS IN ULTRASOUND CT AND MRI

N2  -  Decades ago, Spetzler (1986) and Sawaya (1998) provided a rough brain segmentation of the eloquent areas of the brain, aimed to help surgical decisions in cases of vascular malformations and tumors, respectively. Currently in clinical use, their criteria are in need of revision. Defining functions (eg, sensorimotor, language and visual) that should be preserved during surgery seems a straightforward task. In practice, locating the specific areas that could cause a permanent vs transient deficit is not an easy task. This is particularly true for the associative cortex and cognitive domains such as language. The old model, with Broca's and Wernicke's areas at the forefront, has been superseded by a dual-stream model of parallel language processing; named ventral and dorsal pathways. This complicated network of cortical hubs and subcortical white matter pathways needing preservation during surgery is a work in progress. Preserving not only cortical regions but most importantly preserving the connections, or white matter fiber bundles, of core regions in the brain is the new paradigm. For instance, the arcuate fascicululs and inferior frontooccipital fasciculus are key components of the dorsal and ventral language pathways, respectively; and their damage result in permanent language deficits. Interestedly, the damage of the temporal portions of these bundles-where there is a crossroad with other multiple bundles-, appears to be more important (permanent) than the damage of the frontal portions -where plasticity and contralateral activation could help. Although intraoperative direct cortical and subcortical stimulation have contributed largely, advanced MR techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tractography (DT), are at the epi-center of our current understanding. Nevertheless, these techniques posse important challenges: such as neurovascular uncoupling or venous bias on fMRI; and appropriate anatomical validation or accurate representation of crossing fibers on DT. These limitations should be well understood and taken into account in clinical practice. Unifying multidisciplinary research and clinical efforts is desirable, so these techniques could contribute more efficiently not only to locate eloquent areas but to improve outcomes and our understanding of neural plasticity. Finally, although there are constant anatomical and functional regions at the individual level, there is a known variability at the inter-individual level. This concept should strengthen the importance of a personalized approach when evaluating these regions on fMRI and DT. It should strengthen the importance of personalized treatments as well, aimed to meet tailored needs and expectations. Semin Ultrasound CT MRI 42:474-489 (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Advanced methods of imaging and mapping the healthy and lesioned brain have allowed for the identification of the cortical nodes and white matter tracts supporting the dual neurofunctional organization of language networks in a dorsal phonological and a ventral semantic stream. Much less understood are the anatomical correlates of the interaction between the two streams; one hypothesis being that of a subcortically mediated interaction, through crossed cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical loops. In this regard, the pulvinar is the thalamic subdivision that has most regularly appeared as implicated in the processing of lexical retrieval. However, descriptions of its connections with temporal (language) areas remain scarce.Here we assess this pulvino-temporal connectivity using a combination of state-of-the-art techniques: white matter stimulation in awake surgery and postoperative diffusion MRI (n = 4), virtual dissection from the Human Connectome Project 3 and 7 T datasets (n = 172) and operative microscope-assisted post-mortem fibre dissection (n = 12).We demonstrate the presence of four fundamental fibre contingents: (i) the anterior component (Arnold's bundle proper) initially described by Arnold in the 19th century and destined to the anterior temporal lobe; (ii) the optic radiations-like component, which leaves the pulvinar accompanying the optical radiations and reaches the posterior basal temporal cortices; (iii) the lateral component, which crosses the temporal stem orthogonally and reaches the middle temporal gyrus; and (iv) the auditory radiations-like component, which leaves the pulvinar accompanying the auditory radiations to the superomedial aspect of the temporal operculum, just posteriorly to Heschl's gyrus.Each of those components might correspond to a different level of information processing involved in the lexical retrieval process of picture naming.
Maldonado et al. use in vivo tractography and post-mortem dissections to study the connections joining the pulvinar to the temporal lobe. They describe four branches, including one parallel to the auditory radiations, and show by electrical stimulation in awake surgery that this branch has a causal role in lexical retrieval.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  Corpus callosum (CC), the largest compact white matter fiber bundle of the human brain involved in interhemispheric transfer, is frequently damaged in the course of multiple sclerosis (MS). Cognitive impairment is one of the factors affecting quality of life of patients with benign VIS (BMS). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the cognitive profile of BMS patients and the extent of tissue damage in the CC. Brain conventional and DT MRI scans were acquired from 54 BMS patients and 21 healthy controls. Neuropsychological tests (NPT) exploring memory, attention, and frontal lobe cognitive domains were administered to the patient. DT tractography was used to calculate the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CC normal appearing White matter (NAWM). An index of CC atrophy was also estimated. Nine (17%) BMS patients fulfilled criteria for cognitive impairment. Compared with controls, BMS had significantly different CC diffusivity and volumetry (P < 0.001). Compared with cognitively preserved patients, those with CI had significantly higher CC lesion Volume (LV) (P = 0.02) and NAWM MD (P = 0.02). The scores obtained at PASAT were significantly correlated with CC T2 LV, and NAWM FA and MD (r values ranging from -0.31 to 0.66, P values ranging from 0.04 to <0.001). Cognitive impairment in BMS is associated with the extent of CC damage in terms of both focal lesions and diffuse fiber bundle injury. MRI assessment of topographical distribution Of tissue damage may represent a rewarding strategy for understanding the subtle clinical deficits of patients with BMS.

N2  -  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging has evolved from an esoteric laboratory experiment to a critical aspect of routine clinical care of the patient presenting with symptoms suspicious of acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this article is to review the basis of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), to consider its application in acute stroke and to recognize potential pitfalls and stroke mimics that might be encountered. Included in the discussion are comments on the elimination of 'T2 shine through' phenomena as well as construction of pixel-by-pixel maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Furthermore, discussion of techniques such as parallel imaging (using SENSE) and PROPELLER sequences will be introduced as methods potentially allowing DWI to be utilized in areas usually associated with prohibitive susceptibility artifact (e.g. the base of the brain). Finally, the concept of interventional therapeutic approaches to salvaging ischemic tissue is introduced, both in terms of the ischemic penumbra (defined by a diffusion/perfusion mismatch) and also in terms of the potential reversibility of the diffusion-weighted hyperintensity, associated with the lesion core.

N2  -  The purpose of this report is to describe the state of imaging techniques and technologies for detecting response of brain tumors to treatment in the setting of multicenter clinical trials. Within currently used technologies, implementation of standardized image acquisition and the use of volumetric estimates and subtraction maps are likely to help to improve tumor visualization, delineation, and quantification. Upon further development, refinement, and standardization, imaging technologies such as diffusion and perfusion MRI and amino acid PET may contribute to the detection of tumor response to treatment, particularly in specific treatment settings. Over the next few years, new technologies such as 2(3)Na MRI and CEST imaging technologies will be explored for their use in expanding the ability to quantitatively image tumor response to therapies in a clinical trial setting.

N2  -  Using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) as a single contrast agent, we investigated dual contrast cerebrovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for simultaneously monitoring macro- and microvasculature and their association with ischemic edema status (via apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat models. High-resolution T1-contrast based ultra-short echo time MR angiography (UTE-MRA) visualized size remodeling of pial arteries and veins whose mutual association with cortical ischemic edema status is rarely reported. Delta R-2-Delta R-2*-MRI-derived vessel size index (VSI) and density indices (Q and MVD) mapped morphological changes of microvessels occurring in subcortical ischemic edema lesions. In cortical ischemic edema lesions, significantly dilated pial veins (p = 0.0051) and thinned pial arteries (p = 0.0096) of ipsilateral brains compared to those of contralateral brains were observed from UTE-MRAs. In subcortical regions, ischemic edema lesions had a significantly decreased Q and MVD values (p < 0.001), as well as increased VSI values (p < 0.001) than normal subcortical tissues in contralateral brains. This pilot study suggests that MR-based morphological vessel changes, including but not limited to venous blood vessels, are directly related to corresponding tissue edema status in ischemic stroke rat models.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The functional importance of the superior temporal lobe at the level of Heschl's gyrus is well known. However, the organization and function of these cortical areas and the underlying fiber tracts connecting them remain unclear. The goal of this study was to analyze the area formed by the organization of the intersection of Heschl's gyrus-related fiber tracts, which the authors have termed the "Heschl's gyrus fiber intersection area" (HGFIA).
METHODS The subcortical connectivity of Heschl's gyrus tracts was analyzed by white matter fiber dissection and by diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The white matter tracts organized in relation to Heschl's gyrus were isolated in 8 human hemispheres from cadaveric specimens and in 8 MRI studies in 4 healthy volunteers. In addition, these tracts and their functions were described in the surgical cases of left temporal gliomas next to the HGFIA in 6 patients who were awake during surgery and underwent intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping.; RESULTS Five tracts were observed to pass through the HGFIA: the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus, the middle longitudinal fasciculus, the acoustic radiation, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the optic radiation. In addition, U fibers originating at the level of Heschl's gyrus and heading toward the middle temporal gyrus were identified.; CONCLUSIONS This investigation of the HGFIA, a region where 5 fiber tracts intersect in a relationship with the primary auditory area, provides new insights into the subcortical organization of Wernicke's area. This information is valuable when a temporal surgical approach is planned, in order to assess the surgical risk related to language disturbances.

N2  -  This study presents histological validation of an objective (unsupervised) computer segmentation algorithm, the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA), for analysis of multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in experimental focal cerebral Ischemia. T2-, T1-, and diffusion (DWI) weighted coronal images were acquired from 4 to 168 hours after stroke on separate groups of animals. Animals were killed immediately after MRI for histological analysis. MR images were coregistered/warped to histology, MRI lesion areas were defined using DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, T2-weighted images, and ISODATA. The last techniques clearly discriminated between ischemia-altered and morphologically intact tissue. ISODATA areas were congruent and significantly correlated (r = 0.99, P < 0.05) with histologically defined lesions, In contrast, DWI. ADC, and T2 lesion areas showed no significant correlation with histologically evaluated lesions until subacute time points. These data indicate that multiparameter ISODATA methodology can accurately detect and identify ischemic cell damage early and late after ischemia, with ISODATA outperforming ADC, DWI, and T2-weighted images in identification of Ischemic lesions from 4 to 168 hours after stroke, (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is frequent in the elderly, and accounts for a wide spectrum of clinical and radiological manifestations. This report summarizes the most important findings obtained using diffusion MRI (DWI) in SVD. With DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, recent ischemic lesions can easily be detected after acute stroke in SVD, while even multiple simultaneous lesions may be observed. Microstructural changes are frequent in SVD, with increases in diffusivity and decreases in anisotropy being the most reliable findings observed, mainly in white matter. These tissue changes are associated with clinical severity and especially executive dysfunction. They can also precede the usual MRI markers of SVD, such as white matter hyperintensities, microbleeds and lacunes. Thus, DWI may reveal surrogate markers of SVD progression and offer a better understanding of their underlying mechanisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background and Purpose We sought to identify MRI measures that have high probability in a short acquisition time to predict, at early time points after onset of ischemia, the eventual development of cerebral infarction in clinical patients who suffer occlusion of a cerebral artery.
Methods We developed an MR tissue signature model based on experimentally derived relationships of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC(W)) and T-2 to ischemic brain tissue histopathology. In eight stroke patients we measured ADC(W) and T-2 intensity using diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DW-EPI). Tissue signature regions were defined, and theme maps of the ischemic focus at subacute time paints after stroke onset were generated.; Results Five MR signatures were identified in human stroke foci: two that may predict either cell recovery or progression to necrosis, one that may mark the transition to cell necrosis, and two that may be markers of established cell necrosis.; Conclusions An MR tissue signature model of ischemic histopathology using ADC(W) and T-2 can now be tested for its potential to predict reversible and identify irreversible cellular damage in human ischemic brain regions.

N2  -  Although ischemic stroke has higher incidence and severity in aged than in young humans, the age factor is generally neglected in ischemia animal models. This study was aimed at comparing age-dependent effects at early stages of transient global cerebral ischemia (TGCI) in rats. TGCI was induced in two groups of rats (3-6 and 20-24 months old, respectively) by exposure to 15% oxygen and 15 min occlusion of the two common carotid arteries. Brains were analysed in vivo by MRI-apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T-2 maps-at 1-3 h post-TGCI and in vitro by histochemical examination of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained slices. At 1-3 h post-TGCI, a higher incidence of lesions was found in aged than in young rats especially in the hippocampus and cortex (occipital plus parietal) but not in the thalamus. The lesioned regions showed lower ADC values in aged than in younger rats. The most substantial ADC decreases were associated with enhanced spin-spin relaxation and lower TTC staining. The different responses of the two age groups support the use of aged animals for investigations on different ischemia models. Our model of brain ischemia appears appropriate for further studies including drug effects.

N2  -  Object. The role of functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging has become increasingly important in the presurgical mapping of gray matter. Neurosurgical interventions often involve fiber bundles that connect critical functional areas. Recently, diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging has enabled the visualization of fiber bundle direction and integrity, thus providing the ability to delineate clearly white matter from gray matter tissue. The main objective of this study was to improve the presurgical assessment of critical functionality in the vicinity of brain lesions by combining DT and fMR imaging methodologies.
Methods. Twenty patients with various space-occupying brain lesions underwent imaging for presurgical evaluation of motor andor somatosensory functions. The authors focus on five patients with diverse space-occupying brain lesions. Diffusion tensor-based fiber tracking and fMR imaging activation maps were superimposed in three dimensions to visualize pyramidal tracts corresponding to motor and somatosensory regional activation.; Conclusions. The combination of DT and fMR imaging for presurgical functional brain mapping provides valuable information that cannot be extracted using either method alone. The validity and sensitivity of noninvasive functional mapping for surgical guidance could be improved by considering results obtained with both methods. Furthermore, the use of three-dimensional visualization seems crucial and unique for viewing and understanding the complicated spatial relationship among the lesion, gray matter activation, and white matter fiber bundles.

N2  -  Aim. This work reports the analysis of the relationship between inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), neoplastic lesions and surgical resection, in patients operated for gliomas located in the frontal, temporal and insular lobes of the dominant hemisphere. Aim of the study is evaluating the predictive value of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus DTI-fiber tracking (FT) for determining the extent of resection preoperatively.
Methods. We selected 38 cases affected by lesions located in the frontal, temporal and insular lobes of the dominant hemisphere, which were related to the trajectory of the IFO. For each patient preoperative and postoperative MR images and DTI-FT were loaded into the neuronavigation system and merged; volumetric scan analysis was used for establishing tumor location and topography, as well as the volume of the lesion and of the residual tumor. All preoperative fiber tracking datasets were evaluated and the position of the tract (IFO) compared to the tumor was recorded. Postoperative MR scans were then compared with DTI-FT, in order to evaluate the correspondence between the resection boundaries and the trajectory of the fiber tract.; Results. Amongst the cases in which the IFO was inside the lesion, we found only incomplete resections (5 subtotal and 6 partial resections), while considering the cases in which the IFO was located outside the tumor, it was possible to perform a relevant (totalsubtotal) resection in 18 of them (78%).; Conclusion. FT of the inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus predicts the possibility and the extent of the resection for a frontal, temporal andor insular lesion of the dominant hemisphere.

N2  -  The nerve fiber bundles constitutive of the white matter in the brain are organized in such a way that they exhibit a certain degree of structural anisotropy and birefringence. The birefringence exhibited by such aligned fibrous tissue is known to be extremely sensitive to small pathological alterations. Indeed, highly aligned anisotropic fibers exhibit higher birefringence than structures with weaker alignment and anisotropy, such as cancerous tissue. In this study, we performed experiments on thick coronal slices of a healthy human brain to explore the possibility of (i) measuring, with a polarimetric microscope the birefringence exhibited by the white matter and (ii) relating the measured birefringence to the fiber orientation and the degree of alignment. This is done by analyzing the spatial distribution of the degree of polarization of the backscattered light and its variation with the polarization state of the probing beam. We demonstrate that polarimetry can be used to reliably distinguish between white and gray matter, which might help to intraoperatively delineate unstructured tumorous tissue and well organized healthy brain tissue. In addition, we show that our technique is able to sensitively reconstruct the local mean nerve fiber orientation in the brain, which can help to guide tumor resections by identifying vital nerve fiber trajectories thereby improving the outcome of the brain surgery.

Cancer is a global burden that leads to public health and economic problems and ranks as the first or second leading cause of premature death 1. Brain tumors, in particular the malignant ones, were responsible for 238'000 new cases in 2008 worldwide 2,3. The primary treatment for a brain tumor is surgery followed by adjuvant chemo or radio therapy. Gross total resection, i.e., removal the bulk of cancer cells, is paramount for an improved prognosis. Hence, the accuracy of the estimation of the tumor's borders carries heavy consequences for the patients: on one hand, subtotal resection leads to increased risk of recurrence and shorter life expectancy 4-6 and, on the other hand, if healthy tissue is removed as a result of gross resection, this might

N2  -  Although MRI is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumours, the standard clinical sequences cannot tell us about certain features of brain tumours. Improvements in imaging technology now allow advanced sequences, once used exclusively for research, to be used clinically. Assessment of brain tumours with diffusion weighted MR (a marker of cellularity), diffusion tensor MR (shows integrity of surrounding white matter tracts), perfusion MR (marker of turnout vascularity and angiogenesis), MR spectroscopy (showing tumour metabolism) and functional MR (to identify eloquent cortex) provide information that is complementary to the structural information. These techniques can be used to improve identification of the turnout margin, tumour grading, reducing surgical risk and assessing the response to therapy. It is important for the neurosurgeon to understand what information can be obtained from these sequences, and that they ensure they are used to further develop the assessment and management of brain tumours.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in therapy-naive intracranial glioma is paramount for neuro-oncological diagnostics, and it provides images that are helpful for surgery planning and intra-operative guidance during tumor resection, including assessment of the involvement of functionally eloquent brain structures. This study reviews emerging MRI techniques to depict structural information, diffusion characteristics, perfusion alterations, and metabolism changes for advanced neuro-oncological imaging. In addition, it reflects current methods to map brain function close to a tumor, including functional MRI and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation with derived function-based tractography of subcortical white matter pathways. We conclude that modern preoperative MRI in neuro-oncology offers a multitude of possibilities tailored to clinical needs, and advancements in scanner technology (e.g., parallel imaging for acceleration of acquisitions) make multi-sequence protocols increasingly feasible. Specifically, advanced MRI using a multi-sequence protocol enables noninvasive, image-based tumor grading and phenotyping in patients with glioma. Furthermore, the add-on use of preoperatively acquired MRI data in combination with functional mapping and tractography facilitates risk stratification and helps to avoid perioperative functional decline by providing individual information about the spatial location of functionally eloquent tissue in relation to the tumor mass.

N2  -  The challenges in detection, localization, and staging of prostate cancer have prompted the investigation of the role of various magnetic resonance (MR) methodologies in a large cohort of men prior to biopsy. The identification of suspicious areas of malignancy was carried out using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Our data shows that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) may be a reliable marker to differentiate normal, benign, and malignant prostate tissues similar to the metabolite ratio. Also, the combined use of MRSI and DWI improves the diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this review, we present our experience on the use of MRI, MRSI and DWI methods in the assessment of prostate cancer in Indian men. Further, analysis of the comparison of the ADC and the metabolite ratio values reported in the literature across various patient populations are presented.

N2  -  We treated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) and evaluated the effect of treatment on white matter reorganization using MRI. We subjected male Wistar rats (n = 17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n = 9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n = 8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p < 0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T-2 in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, comparedwith FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FTand T-2 can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.

N2  -  Background: Accurate localization of acute ischemic lesions in patients with an acute stroke may aid in understanding the etiology of their stroke and ma) improve the management of these patients.
Objective: To determine the field of adding diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) to a conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol for acute stroke.; Design: A prospective cohort study.; Setting: A referral center.; Patients and Methods: Fifty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke who presented within 48 hours after symptom onset were included. An MRI scan was obtained within 48 hours after symptom onset. A neuroradiologist (A.M.N.) and a stroke neurologist (G.W.A.) independently identified suspected acute ischemic lesions on MRI sequences in the following order: (1) T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images, (2) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, and (3) diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps.; Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic yield and interrater reliability for the identification of acute lesions, and confidence and conspicuity ratings of acute lesions for different MRI sequences.; Results: Conventional MRI correctly identified at least one acute lesion in 71% (3448) to 80% (3949) of patients who had an acute stroke, with the addition of DWI, this percentage increased to 94% (4649) (P<.001). Conventional MRI showed only moderate sensitivity (50%-60%) and specificity (49%-69%) compared with a "criterion standard." Based on the diffusion-weighted sequence, interrater reliability for identifying acute lesions was moderate for conventional MRI (kappa=0.5-0.6) and good for DWI (kappa=0.8). The observers' confidence with which lesions were rated as acute and the lesion conspicuity was significantly (P<.01) higher for DWI than for conventional MRI.; Conclusion: During the first 48 hours after symptom onset, the addition of DWI to conventional MRI improves the accuracy of identifying acute ischemic brain lesions in patients who experienced a stroke.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Acute cerebellitis with unilateral onset is rare, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful method for demonstrating cerebellar involvement. PATIENT: We report a 12-year-old girl with acute cerebellitis with a unique sequential change on her MRI. RESULTS: The patient's brain MRI first revealed cortical lesions mainly in the right cerebellar hemisphere. These subsequently disappeared, and at the same time, new lesions appeared in the opposite cerebellar hemisphere. All the lesions were confined to gray matter in the cerebellum and were isotense on diffusion-weighted imaging and had high signal intensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map, consistent with the characteristic of vasogenic edema. CONCLUSION: The sequential MRI demonstrates conversion of hemicerebellitis to bilateral cerebellitis during subacute phase, and vasogenic edema might be contributing to the pathogenesis of acute cerebellitis in this patient.

N2  -  This study investigates the comparative changes in the sodium MRI signal and proton diffusion following treatment using a 9L rat glioma model to develop markers of earliest response to cancer therapy. Sodium MRI and proton diffusion mapping were performed on untreated (n = 5) and chemotherapy 1,3-bis(2- chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea-treated rats (n = 5). Animals were scanned serially at 2- to 3-day intervals for up to 30 days following therapy. The time course of Na concentration in a tumor showed a dramatic increase in the treated brain tumor compared to the untreated tumor, which correlates in time with an increase in tumor water diffusion. The largest posttreatment increase in sodium signal occurred 7-9 days following treatment and correlated to the period of the greatest chemotherapy-induced cellular necrosis based on diffusion and histopathology. Both Na MRI and proton ADC mapping revealed early changes in tumor sodium content and cellularity. This study demonstrates the possibility of Na MRI to function as a biomarker for monitoring early tumor treatment and validates the use of monitoring changes in diffusion MRI values for assessing tumor cellularity.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To demonstrate the technical feasibility; and precision of a navigated diffusion-weighted(DW) MR imaging method with interleaved echo-planar imaging and test its diagnostic sensitivity for detection of ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements were performed in phantoms, and six healthy adult volunteers were examined to determine intrasubject (precision) and intersubject (reference range) variations in absolute ADC and relative ADC (rADC) measurements,imaging maps and lesion rADC values were:also;obtained in 34 consecutive stroke patients to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of DW-interleaved echo-planar:imaging for detection of ischemic brain damage.; RESULTS: Phantom and volunteer ADC values were in excellent agreement with published data. The intra;subject variation of rADC was 6.2% . The ADC precision ranged from 6.5% in the subcortical white matter in the frontal lobe to 12.9% in the head of the caudate nucleus. Interleaved echo-planar imaging enabled rapid acquisition of high-quality images of the entire brain without substantial artifacts. Within the ist week, the sensitivity of DW-interleaved echo-planar imaging for detection of acute infarction was 90% (18:of 20 true-positive studies); and : independent of lesion location.; CONCLUSION: aw-ininterleaved echo-planar with phase navigation and cardiac triggering i;robust reliable; and fast. With high sensitivity for detection of early ischemic infarction, it is useful for examining stroke:patients:by using MR systems with conventional gradient hardware.

N2  -  An appropriate surgical approach for posterior fossa lesions is to start tumor removal from areas with a defined plane to where tumor is infiltrating the brainstem or peduncles. This surgical approach minimizes risk of damage to eloquent areas. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard preoperative imaging obtained for diagnosis and surgical planning of pediatric posterior fossa tumors, it offers limited information on the infiltrative planes between tumor and normal structures in patients with medulloblastomas. Because medulloblastomas demonstrate diffusion restriction on apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC map) sequences, we investigated the role of ADC map in predicting infiltrative and non-infiltrative planes along the brain stem and/or cerebellar peduncles by medulloblastomas prior to surgery.
Thirty-four pediatric patients with pathologically confirmed medulloblastomas underwent surgical resection at our facility from 2004 to 2012. An experienced pediatric neuroradiologist reviewed the brain MRIsADC map, assessing the planes between the tumor and cerebellar pedunclesbrain stem. An independent evaluator documented surgical findings from operative reports for comparison to the radiographic findings. The radiographic findings were statistically compared to the documented intraoperative findings to determine predictive value of the test in identifying tumor infiltration of the brain stem cerebellar peduncles.; Twenty-six patients had preoperative ADC mapping completed and thereby, met inclusion criteria. Mean age at time of surgery was 8.3 +- A 4.6 years. Positive predictive value of ADC maps to predict tumor invasion of the brain stem and cerebellar peduncles ranged from 69 to 88 %; negative predictive values ranged from 70 to 89 %. Sensitivity approached 93 % while specificity approached 78 %.; ADC maps are valuable in predicting the infiltrative and non-infiltrative planes along the tumor and brain stem interface in medulloblastomas. Inclusion and evaluation of ADC maps in preoperative evaluation can assist in surgical resection planning in patients with medulloblastoma.

N2  -  Introduction: MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a mitochondrial hereditary dysfunction in which the physiopathological mechanism of cerebral lesions is not totally understood as yet. Typically, these lesions are described as having normal to increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and this has been used to distinguish stroke-like lesions from ischemic lesions. Notwithstanding this, within the last few years, there have been reports of diffusion restriction in stroke-like episodes.
Objectives: Analysis of the diffusion characteristics on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a 16 month period, on a patient with MELAS and stroke-like lesions, to investigate the controversial changes of the ADC, reported in the last years. Evaluation of the proton spectroscopy changes in stroke-like lesions and apparently spared brain.; Methods: We performed four serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including two stroke-like episodes, in a 28-year-old man with MELAS (mitochondrial DNA mutation A3243G). Qualitative analysis of the magnetic resonance images, including the single voxel spectroscopy and ADC maps, with analysis of evolution patterns of the last ones.; Results: Both MRI that were performed during those episodes of stroke-like lesion revealed areas of diffusion restriction, coexisting areas of high ADC. During the chronic phase, there was a regression of those changes. Proton spectroscopy showed the presence of lactate and reduction of N-acetil aspartate peak in stroke-like lesion and the presence of lactate in apparently spared brain.; Conclusions: All alterations that were recorded strengthen the view that citotoxic oedema can occur in stroke-like lesions. Thus, their presence should not weaken the possibility of MELAS, especially if those lesions affect the temporal, parietal andor occipital lobes, or if they predominantly involve the cortical gray matter, spanning vascular borders and if proton spectroscopy reveals lactate peak in the apparently spared brain.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Diffusion MRT has established value in patients with ischemic stroke but has not been systematically investigated in patients with transient ischemic attack (TLA),
Methods-Clinical, conventional MRT, and diffusion MRI data were collected on 42 consecutive patients with symptoms of cerebral TIA, TLA imaging data were compared with those from a contemporaneous group of 23 completed stroke patients.; Results-Twenty of the 42 TIA patients (48%) demonstrated neuroanatomically relevant focal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging. When present, DWIADC signal changes in TLA patients were less pronounced and smaller in volume than those in completed stroke patients, TIA symptom duration was significantly longer for DWI-positive than for DWI-negative patients, 7.3 versus 3.2 hours, Diffusion MRI information changed the suspected anatomic and vascular TIA localization and the suspected etiologic mechanism in over one third of patients with diffusion MRI abnormalities. Of the 20 TIA patients with identifiable lesions on diffusion MRT, 9 had follow-up imaging studies; of these, 4 did not show a relevant infarct on follow-up imaging.; Conclusions-Diffusion MRI demonstrates ischemic abnormalities in nearly half of clinically defined TIA patients, The percentage of patients with a DWI lesion increases with increasing total symptom duration, In nearly half, the diffusion MRI;changes may be fully reversible, while in the remainder the diffusion MRI findings herald the development of a parenchymal infarct despite transient clinical symptoms. Finally, diffusion imaging results have significant clinical utility, frequently changing the presumed localization and etiologic mechanism.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Diagnostic information about cell density variations and microscopic tissue anisotropy can be gained from tensor-valued diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These properties of tissue microstructure have the potential to become novel imaging biomarkers for radiotherapy response. However, tensor-valued diffusion encoding is more demanding than conventional encoding, and its compatibility with MR scanners that are dedicated to radiotherapy has not been established. Thus, our aim was to investigate the feasibility of tensor-valued diffusion MRI with radiotherapy dedicated MR equipment.Material and methods: A tensor-valued diffusion protocol was implemented, and five healthy volunteers were scanned with different resolutions using conventional head coil and radiotherapy coil setup with fixation masks. Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) was evaluated to assess the risk of signal bias due to rectified noise floor. We also evaluated the repeatability and reproducibility of the microstructure parameters. One patient with brain metastasis was scanned to investigate the image quality and the transferability of the setup to diseased tissue.Results: A resolution of 3 x 3 x 3 mm3 provided images with SNR > 3 for 93 % of the voxels using radiotherapy coil setup. The parameter maps and repeatability characteristics were comparable to those observed with a conventional head coil. The patient evaluation demonstrated successful parameter analysis also in tumor tissue, with SNR > 3 for 93 % of the voxels.Conclusion: We demonstrate that tensor-valued diffusion MRI is compatible with radiotherapy fixation masks and coil setup for investigations of microstructure parameters. The reported reproducibility may be used to plan future investigations of imaging biomarkers in brain cancer radiotherapy.

N2  -  Background.-
Reversible changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) weighted in diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent water diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps have been reported in acute stroke, epilepsy, eclampsia, and hypoglycemia, but they are contradictory regarding to migraine aura.; Objective.-; A 41-year-old woman with known basilar migraine for 5 years consulted about a persistent visual aura (visual snow phenomenon) plus bilateral paresthesias in the extremities for 4 days. The headache was treated with success with 10 mg of wafer rizatriptan and 600 mg of ibuprophen.; Methods.-; The neurologic and ophthalmologic examination were normal. An urgent brain MRI detected no lesions in T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and DWI, but an abnormal signal appeared in the left occipital lobe in ADC and (r)ADC maps. The brain MRI angiography, carotid ultrasound study, transesophageal echocardiography, 24-hour cardiac Holter monitoring, and thrombophilia study were normal.; Results.-; A new brain MRI 8 days after did not show any previous lesion in the same sequences.; Conclusions.-; We present a patient with migraine and transitory abnormal signals in the ADC map of an occipital region during persistent visual aura. The clinical-radiological relationship is congruent. Some similar cases have showed these MRI signals during the aura, suggesting cytotoxic edema, without ischemic lesions in the MRI controls. Theses ADC images probably appear in complex auras.

N2  -  Purpose: In a neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury, using T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), we aim to determine the best MRI method of lesion quantification that reflects infarct size.
Materials and methods: Twenty 7-day-old rats underwent MRI 24 h after HI brain injury was induced. Lesion size relative to whole brain was measured using T2WI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, applying thresholds of 60%, 70% and 80% contralateral control hemisphere mean ADC, and at day 10 post-HI on pathology with TTC staining. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to study the relationships between lesion size at MRI and pathology.; Results: Lesion size measurement using all MRI methods significantly correlated with infarct size at pathology; using T2WI, r = 0.808 (p < 0.001), using 80% ADC, 70% ADC and 60% ADC thresholds, r=0.888 (p < 0.001), 0.761, (p < 0.001) and 0.569 (p=0.014), respectively. Eighty percent ADC threshold was found to be the only significant independent predictor of final infarct volume (adjusted RZ = 0.775).; Conclusion: At 24 h post-HI, lesion size on DWI, using 80% ADC threshold is the best predictor of final infarct volume. Although T2WI performed less well, it has the advantage of superior spatial resolution and is technically less demanding. These are important considerations for experiments which utilize MRI as a surrogate method for lesion quantification in the neonatal rat HI model. (c) 2006 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  In a control group of 12 normal children (ages ranging from 9 months to 3 years; mean = 1.6 years) the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of the normal white matter, obtained from automatically generated ADC maps, was 0.84+/-0.14 x 10(-3) mm(2)/S. A patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 with bilateral optic gliomas, and extensive optic pathway involvement was evaluated by diffusion MRI. Multiple measurements of ADC values throughout the involved optic radiations revealed a higher mean value: 1.16+/-0.06 x 10(-3) mm(2)/S than that of the normal white matter, suggesting relatively high molecular motion in these regions, probably representing myelin vacuolization. ADC evaluation of a thalamic hamartoma revealed a lower value (= 1.06 x 10(-3) mm(2)/S) than this. The mean ADC value obtained from multiple measurements of the enlarged optic chiasm, and intraorbital portions of the nerve was similar (= 0.81+/-0.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) to that of the normal cerebral white matter of the control cases. It appears that diffusion imaging can be useful in evaluation of optic pathway involvement in NF1, and might contribute to differentiating optic gliomas from hamartomas, and myelin vacuolization, however, further studies will be required for assessing the role of diffusion imaging in such lesions.

N2  -  We report a case of Wernicke's encephalopathy in which diffusion-weighted MR images demonstrated symmetrical hyperintense lesions in the paraventricular area of the third ventricles,and medial thalami. Apparent diffusion coefficient mapping showed isointensity in the aforementioned areas. Diffusion-weighted MR images may provide evidence of vasogenic edema associated with thiamine deficiency, proven in the histopathology of experimental animals. In addition, diffusion-weighted MRI has many advantages over T2 or FLARE-weighted brain MRI in detecting structural and functional abnormalities in Wernicke's encephalopathy.

N2  -  Purpose: To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 3-tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the anal canal.
Materials and Methods: DTI was performed in 25 men with no clinical history of anal canal disease undergoing MRI for prostate cancer. Analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were determined for the epithelialsubepithelial layer, internal sphincter, external sphincter, and puborectalis. The directionality of diffusion was recorded from colorcoded tractography maps. Obturator internus and gluteus maximus served as reference muscles. Mean (SD) of values for FA, RA, and ADC were compared using analysis of variance. Intra and inter-rater agreement and test reproducibility (n 5) was assessed by Bland-Altman statistics.; Results: Mean (SD) for the epithelialsubepithelial layer, internal, external sphincter, and puborectalis were as follows: FA: 0.283 (0.099); 0.337 (0.049); 0.415 (0.072); and 0.407 (0.062), respectively. RA: 0.241 (0.094); 0.292 (0.050); 0.371 (0.083); 0.361 (0.067), respectively; and ADC: 1.49 (0.23); 1.59 (0.19); 1.51 (0.28); and 1.54 (0.29) x 10(-3) mm(2)s, respectively. Good overall intra and inter-rater agreement and test-retest reproducibility was noted (coefficient of variation of 4.8-19.4% and 5.9-12.9%, respectively).; Conclusion: Anisotropy is evident in the anal canal with good inter-rater agreement and test reproducibility.

N2  -  Background: Although several cases of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy have been reported, to our knowledge, there is no previous report of brain changes in anterior commissure, basal ganglia, cerebellar white matter, and inferior olivary nuclei on magnetic resonance images. The precise mechanisms of action of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy have not been determined.
Objectives: To report a unique case of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy extensively involving multiple lesions and to determine the precise mechanism of action of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy.; Setting: University hospital.; Patient: A 74-year-old woman hospitalized with complaints of progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait disturbance 3 months after the initiation of metronidazole therapy.; Intervention: Brain magnetic resonance imaging and discontinuation of metronidazole therapy.; Main Outcome Measure: We observed changes of multiple lesions found on magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed apparent diffusion coefficient map values.; Results: Initial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain magnetic resonance images showed high signal intensities in diffuse subcortical white matter, anterior commissure, splenium, basal ganglia, midbrain, cerebellar white matter, and bilateral inferior olivary nuclei. These lesions were resolved after discontinuation of metronidazole therapy. However, the lesions in the inferior olivary nuclei were not resolved; rather they became hypertrophic. Apparent diffusion coefficient map values in the symptom period decreased and were normalized after discontinuation of metronidazole therapy.; Conclusions: We describe a patient with metronidazole-induced encephalopathy involving reversible lesions in the anterior commissure, basal ganglia, and cerebellar white matter, which have not been reported previously. We observed inferior olivary hypertrophy, believed to be the result of lesions in the midbrain and cerebellar white matter rather than the result of lesions induced by metronidazole therapy. By using diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, we found that metronidazole-induced encephalopathy might be caused by cytotoxic edema.

N2  -  Purpose: To categorize the varied appearances of tumor-altered white matter (WM) tracts on diffusion tensor eigenvector directional color maps.
Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained preoperatively in 13 patients with brain tumors ranging from benign to high-grade malignant, including primary and metastatic lesions, and maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and major eigenvector direction were generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn within identifiable WM tracts affected by tumor, avoiding grossly cystic and necrotic regions, known fiber crossings, and gray matter. Patterns of WM tract alteration were categorized on the basis of qualitative analysis of directional color maps and correlation analysis of ADC and FA.; Results: Four basic patterns of WM alteration were identified: 1) normal or nearly normal FA and ADC, with abnormal tract location or tensor directions attributable to bulk mass displacement, 2) moderately decreased FA and increased ADC with normal tract locations and tensor directions, 3) moderately decreased FA and increased ADC with abnormal tensor directions, and 4) near isotropy. FA and ADC were inversely correlated for Patterns 1-3 but did not discriminate edema from infiltrating tumor. However, in the absence of mass displacement, infiltrating tumor was found to produce tensor directional changes that were not observed with vasogenic edema, suggesting the possibility of discrimination on the basis of directional statistics.; Conclusion: Tumor alteration of VIM tracts tends to produce one of four patterns on FA and directional color maps. Clinical application of these patterns must await further study.

N2  -  Purpose
Peritumoral edema impedes the full delineation of fiber tracts due to partial volume effects in image voxels that contain a mixture of cerebral parenchyma and extracellular water. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of incorporating a free water (FW) model of edema for white matter tractography in the presence of edema.; Materials and methods; We retrospectively evaluated 26 consecutive brain tumor patients with diffusion MRI and T2-weighted images acquired presurgically. Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) was performed using the two-tensor unscented Kalman filter tractography (UKFt) method, the UKFt method with a reduced fiber tracking stopping fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold (UKFt+rFA), and the UKFt method with the addition of a FW compartment (UKFt+FW). An automated white matter fiber tract identification approach was applied to delineate the AF. Quantitative measurements included tract volume, edema volume, and mean FW fraction. Visual comparisons were performed by three experts to evaluate the quality of the detected AF tracts.; Results; The AF volume in edematous brain hemispheres was significantly larger using the UKFt+FW method (p<0.0001) compared to UKFt, but not significantly larger (p = 0.0996) in hemispheres without edema. The AF size increase depended on the volume of edema: a significant correlation was found between AF volume affected by (intersecting) edema and AF volume change with the FW model (Pearson r = 0.806, p<0.0001). The mean FW fraction was significantly larger in tracts intersecting edema (p = 0.0271). Compared to the UKFt+rFA method, there was a significant increase of the volume of the AF tract that intersected the edema using the UKFt+FW method, while the whole AF volumes were similar. Expert judgment results, based on the five patients with the smallest AF volumes, indicated that the expert readers generally preferred the AF tract obtained by using the FW model, according to their anatomical knowledge and considering the potential influence of the final results on the surgical route.; Conclusion; Our results indicate that incorporating biophysical models of edema can increase the sensitivity of tractography in regions of peritumoral edema, allowing better tract visualization in patients with high grade gliomas and metastases.

N2  -  The temporal magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of human brain tissue during formalin fixation was measured and modeled using a diffusion mathematical model of formalin fixation. Coronal MR images of three human brains before formalin fixation and at multiple time points thereafter were acquired. T-1 relaxation, T-2 relaxation, water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and proton density (PD) maps were calculated. The size of a light "formalin band" region, visible in T-1 weighted images, was compared to a mathematical model of diffusive mass transfer of formalin into the brain. T-1 relaxation, T-2 relaxation, and PD all decreased, in both gray and white matter, as formalin fixation progressed. The ADC remained more or less constant. The location of the inner boundary of the formalin band followed a time course consistent with the steepest formalin concentration gradient in the mathematical model. Based on the diffusion model, the brain is not completely saturated in formation until after 14.8 weeks of formalin immersion and, based on the observed changes in T-1, T-2, and PD, fixation is not complete until after 5.4 weeks. During fixation, the ongoing attenuation of T-1 relaxation, T-2 relaxation, and PD must be taken into consideration when performing postmortem MRI studies.

N2  -  Background: Spatial and temporal changes in brain tissue after acute ischemic stroke are still poorly understood. Aims of this study were three-fold: (1) to determine unique temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns at the acute, subacute and chronic stages after stroke in macaques by combining quantitative T-2 and diffusion MRI indices into MRI 'tissue signatures', (2) to evaluate temporal differences in these signatures between transient (n = 2) and permanent (n = 2) middle cerebral artery occlusion, and (3) to correlate histopathology findings in the chronic stroke period to the acute and subacute MRI derived tissue signatures.
Results: An improved iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used to combine T-2, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps across seven successive timepoints (1, 2, 3, 24, 72, 144, 240 h) which revealed five temporal MRI signatures, that were different from the normal tissue pattern (P < 0.001). The distribution of signatures between brains with permanent and transient occlusions varied significantly between groups (P < 0.001). Qualitative comparisons with histopathology revealed that these signatures represented regions with different histopathology. Two signatures identified areas of progressive injury marked by severe necrosis and the presence of gitter cells. Another signature identified less severe but pronounced neuronal and axonal degeneration, while the other signatures depicted tissue remodeling with vascular proliferation and astrogliosis.; Conclusion: These exploratory results demonstrate the potential of temporally and spatially combined voxel-based methods to generate tissue signatures that may correlate with distinct histopathological features. The identification of distinct ischemic MRI signatures associated with specific tissue fates may further aid in assessing and monitoring the efficacy of novel pharmaceutical treatments for stroke in a pre-clinical and clinical setting.

N2  -  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is characterized by bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensities on T2W and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, consistent with its extrapyramidal neurological manifestations. MRI is diagnostically uninformative about the cerebellar symptoms, equally prominent in CJD. This study was undertaken to explain this apparent paradox. Eleven CJD patients with definite cerebellar or brain stem symptoms were selected from a large prospective study, as well as 11 healthy controls matched for age and gender. All subjects participated in a standardized MRI protocol, including SPGR, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), DWI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). All subjects underwent detailed examination by a neurologist blinded to the radiological findings, who predicted the expected site of cerebral abnormalities. MRI showed good sensitivity for the abnormalities predicted in the cortex (80-90%) and basal ganglia (100%). None of the standard MRI sequences, including DWI, DTI, and FLAIR, revealed any tissue abnormalities in cerebellum or brain stem. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, however, were substantially and significantly elevated in several cerebellar structures, where also the volumetric (VBM) analysis revealed elevated cerebrospinal fluid volume, suggesting focal cerebellar atrophy in these CJD patients. In patients with CJD, DWI appears sensitive to the reduced diffusivity in cortex and basal ganglia but insensitive to cerebellar involvement. We propose that the radiological hallmark of cerebellar pathology in CJD is atrophy, revealed quantitatively by both VBM and elevated diffusivity, which is identifiable on ADC maps but poorly visualized in nonquantitative DWI images.

N2  -  MRI is undoubtedly the cornerstone of brain tumor imaging, playing a key role in all phases of patient management, starting from diagnosis, through therapy planning, to treatment response and/or recurrence assessment. Currently, neuroimaging can describe morphologic and non-morphologic (functional, hemodynamic, metabolic, cellular, microstructural, and sometimes even genetic) characteristics of brain tumors, greatly contributing to diagnosis and follow-up. Knowing the technical aspects, strength and limits of each MR technique is crucial to correctly interpret MR brain studies and to address clinicians to the best treatment strategy. This article aimed to provide an overview of neuroimaging in the assessment of adult primary brain tumors. We started from the basilar role of conventional/morphological MR sequences, then analyzed, one by one, the non-morphological techniques, and finally highlighted future perspectives, such as radiomics and artificial intelligence.

N2  -  BackgroundThis study was designed to investigate the use of time-dependent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in distinguishing between glioblastomas and brain metastases.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted involving 65 patients with glioblastomas and 27 patients with metastases using a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence with oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE, 50 Hz) and a conventional pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE, 0 Hz) sequence. In addition to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from two sequences (ADC(50Hz) and ADC(0Hz)), we generated maps of the ADC change (cADC): ADC(50Hz) - ADC(0Hz) and the relative ADC change (rcADC): (ADC(50Hz) - ADC(0Hz))/ ADC(0Hz) x 100 (%).ResultsThe mean and the fifth and 95th percentile values of each parameter in enhancing and peritumoral regions were compared between glioblastomas and metastases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the best discriminating indices were compared. In enhancing regions, none of the indices of ADC(0Hz) and ADC(50Hz) showed significant differences between metastases and glioblastomas. The mean cADC and rcADC values of metastases were significantly higher than those of glioblastomas (0.24 & PLUSMN; 0.12 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s vs. 0.14 & PLUSMN; 0.03 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s and 23.3 & PLUSMN; 9.4% vs. 14.0 & PLUSMN; 4.7%; all p < 0.01). In peritumoral regions, no significant difference in all ADC indices was observed between metastases and glioblastomas. The AUC values for the mean cADC (0.877) and rcADC (0.819) values in enhancing regions were significantly higher than those for ADC(0Hz)(5th) (0.595; all p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe time-dependent diffusion MRI parameters may be useful for differentiating brain metastases from glioblastomas.

N2  -  White matter fiber tracking using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a noninvasive approach to map brain connections, but improving anatomical accuracy has been a significant challenge since the birth of tractography methods. Utilizing tractography in brain studies therefore requires understanding of its technical limitations to avoid shortcomings and pitfalls. This review explores tractography limitations and how different white matter pathways pose different challenges to fiber tracking methodologies. We summarize the pros and cons of commonly-used methods, aiming to inform how tractography and its related analysis may lead to questionable results. Extending these experiences, we review the clinical utilization of tractography in patients with brain tumors and traumatic brain injury, starting from tensor-based tractography to more advanced methods. We discuss current limitations and highlight novel approaches in the context of these two conditions to inform future tractography developments.

N2  -  Medical records of 40 dogs presented for evaluation of acute-onset, nonprogressive, intracranial dysfunction by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis of brain infarction were reviewed. Location of the brain infarcts was: 11 of 38, telencephalic; 8 of 38, thalamic/midbrain; 18 of 38, cerebellar and 3 of 38, multifocal. Telencephalic in farcts developed within the territory of the middle cerebral (4/11), rostral cerebral (2/11), and striate (5/11) arteries. Thalamic/midbrain infarcts developed within the territory of perforating arteries or the caudal portion of the thalamus and rostral portion of the brain stein (8/8). All cerebellar infarcts (18/38) were within the territory of the rostral cerebellar artery or one of its branches. All infarcts appeared nonhemorrhagic, with marked contrast enhancement observed in only 3 of 38 (logs, all of which were imaged more than 7 days after the onset of signs of neurologic dysfunction. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were available from 6 dogs, all imaged within 5 days of the onset of signs of neurologic dysfunction. Suspected infarcts were hyperintense on DWI sequences and were hypointense oil the apparent diffusion coefficient map. Telencephalic infarcts caused abnormal mental status, contralateral postural reaction deficit, contralateral nasal hypalgesia, contralateral menace deficit, and ipsilateral circling. Thalamic/midbrain infarcts caused contralateral or ipsilateral postural reaction deficit, contralateral menace deficit, ipsilateral head tilt or turn, nystagmus, ventrolateral strabismus, and anisocoria. Cerebellar infarcts caused ipsilateral asymmetric cerebellar quality ataxia, head tilt, intermittent opistliotonus, nystagmus, and ipsilateral menace deficit with apparent normal vision.

N2  -  In this paper a novel multi-stage automatic method for brain tumour detection and neovasculature assessment is presented. First, the brain symmetry is exploited to register the magnetic resonance (MR) series analysed. Then, the intracranial structures are found and the region of interest (ROI) is constrained within them to tumour and peritumoural areas using the Fluid Light Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) series. Next, the contrast-enhanced lesions are detected on the basis of T1-weighted (T1W) differential images before and after contrast medium administration. Finally, their vascularisation is assessed based on the Regional Cerebral Blood Volume (RCBV) perfusion maps. The relative RCBV (rRCBV) map is calculated in relation to a healthy white matter, also found automatically, and visualised on the analysed series. Three main types of brain tumours, i.e. HG gliomas, metastases and meningiomas have been subjected to the analysis. The results of contrast enhanced lesions detection have been compared with manual delineations performed independently by two experts, yielding 64.84% sensitivity, 99.89% specificity and 71.83% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for twenty analysed studies of subjects with brain tumours diagnosed.

N2  -  PURPOSE: The authors evaluated a phase-navigated spin-echo (SE) motion-correction sequence for use at diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after cerebral infarction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients underwent 32 conventional T2-weighted fast SE and SE DW imaging after stroke (n = 25), transient ischemic attack (n = 3), or reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (n = 1). Imaging was performed in a standard head holder with standard padding. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reconstructed.; RESULTS: DW images depicted high signal intensity compatible with localization of the ischemic symptoms in all cases. Lesions were depicted more clearly on DW than on T2-weighted images. On DW images, acute infarct ADC values were uniformly low (mean, 0.401 x 10(-5) cm(2)sec +- 0.143 standard deviation) compared with control ADC values (mean, 0.754 x 10(-5) cm(2)sec +- 0.201). ADC values of chronic infarcts were supranormal (mean, 1.591 x 10(-5) cm(2)sec +- 0.840) compared with control values (mean, 0.788 x 10(-5) cm(2)sec +- 0.166). DW imaging did not show a change after transient ischemic attack. With reversible ischemic neurologic deficit, however, hyperintensity on DW images and low ADC resolved after symptoms abated.; CONCLUSION: Clinical phase-navigated SE DW imaging improved early diagnosis of stroke and helped differentiate acute from chronic stroke. Changes on DW images are reversed after symptoms resolve.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and utility of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI for characterizing alterations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in pediatric patients with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS).
Materials and Methods: Ten children with AIS were studied within 4 to 125 hours following symptom onset, using a pulsed ASL (PASL) protocol attached to clinically indicated MR examinations. The interhemisphere perfusion deficit (IHPD) was measured in predetermined vascular territories and infarct regions of restricted diffusion. which were compared with the degree of arterial stenosis and volumes of ischemic infarcts.; Results: Interpretable CBF maps were obtained in all 10 patients, showing simple lesion in nine patients (five hypoperfusion, two hyperperfusion, and two normal perfusion) and complex lesions in one patient. Both acute and follow-up infarct volumes were significantly larger in cases with hypoperfusion than in either hyper- or normal perfusion cases. The IHPD was found to correlate with the degree of stenosis, diffusion lesion, and follow-up T-2 infarct volumes. Mismatch between per-fusion and diffusion lesions was observed. Brain regions presenting delayed arterial transit effects were tentatively associated with positive outcome.; Conclusion: This study demonstrates the clinical utility of ASL in the neuroimaging diagnosis of pediatric AIS.

T2  -  BRAIN INJURY

N2  -  Primary objective: To increase the knowledge about diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) by reporting the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings observed in a patient with reversible extensive restricted diffusion of the brain at diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Case study: An 18-year-old patient was admitted after high-energy closed TBI. Glasgow Coma Scale score was 4. Head computed tomography showed small left frontal and temporal haemorrhagic contusions and a small haemorrhage in the left thalamus. Ten days later, brain MRI showed diffuse high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images and DWI and restricted diffusion in the subcortical white matter of both centri semiovali, genu and splenium of corpus callosum and parietal cortex bilaterally (mean ADC value = 0.434-0.811 10-3 mm2 s-1). Eleven days later, follow-up brain MRI showed gliotic changes in the left splenium of corpus callosum, a clearcut decrease of T2-weighted high-signal intensity and resolution of abnormalities at DWI and ADC maps in all other involved sites. This was confirmed 36 days later. Three months later, the patient did not show neurological, cognitive or neuropsychiatric deficits. Conclusions: In the patient reported herein, closed TBI most likely induced diffuse excitotoxic injury of the brain which resulted in mainly reversible cytotoxic or intramyelinic oedema.

N2  -  Background and Purpose. In middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, ischemia usually is unevenly distributed within the MCA territory. We sought to investigate which brain structures are critical for the acute neurological deficit in severe MCA stroke. Methods. We used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and statistical parametric mapping in 64 consecutive stroke patients (64 +/- 13 years) to study the pattern of the initial perfusion abnormality. Results. Patients with lesion progression had more severe time-to-peak (TTP) abnormalities (P < .0001) in the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and underlying hemispheric white matter than those with lesion regression. Also, patients with lesion progression had more severe T2 abnormalities on day 8 than those with lesion regression. In contrast, the changes of water diffusion were similar among the two groups resulting in a perfusion-diffusion mismatch in lesion progression. TTP-lesions were related to the neurological deficit score (r(s) = -0.563, P < .0001), T2-lesions (r = 0.686, P < .0001), and cerebral artery abnormalities assessed on MR-angiography (r(s) = 0.399, P < .01). Conclusions. In major MCA, stroke ischemia was most severe in the central portion of the MCA territory. It is suggested that involvement of hemispheric white matter accentuated the neurological deficit probably by affecting cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical fibers.

T2  -  NEUROIMAGING CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA

N2  -  In the past decade, an array of new MR imaging techniques has been applied to brain tumors. With superior contrast and resolution and without the need for image coregistration, functional MR imaging techniques may displace positron emission tomography (PET) as the pre-eminent modality for studying brain and tumor physiology and chemistry for indications other than receptor-based imaging. Nevertheless, the new MR imaging techniques require further histologic, physiologic, and intraoperative validation in suitable animal models and in clinical studies and should be used to compliment PET. Application of echo-planar imaging and other fast imaging sequences can merge several MR studies into a 1-hour clinical examination. Synergistic information provided by these new techniques might soon enable physicians to reach the ultimate goals of noninvasive tumor grading and the avoidance of biopsy.

N2  -  The effect of anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (anti-ICAM-1) antibody treatment of transient (2 h) middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the rat was measured using diffusion (DWI)-, T-2 (T2I)- and perfusion (PWI)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Rats were treated upon reperfusion with an anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (n = 11) or a control antibody (n = 7). DWI, T2I and PWI were performed before, during, and after induction of focal cerebral ischemia from 1 h to 7 days. In both groups, the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC(W)) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) values in the ischemic region significantly declined from the preischemic ADC(W) values (p < 0.05). The post ischemic increase in T-2 of the control group was significantly higher at 48 h than in the anti-ICAM-1 treated group (p < 0.05), CBF was not significantly different between the two groups. The temporal profiles of MRI cluster analysis, which combines ADC(W) and T-2 maps into a single image, was significantly different between groups. These data suggest that the neuroprotective effect of anti-ICAM-1 antibody treatment is reflected in reductions of T-2 and lesion growth during reperfusion and may not be associated with increased cerebral perfusion.

N2  -  Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) has been proposed as an attractive non-invasive tool for evaluating cerebral haemodynamics. Quantitative maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP) and various other haemodynamic parameters can be obtained. Recent advances in hard- and software made PWI available for clinical routine. Although PWI became common in adult neuroradiology, it remains challenging in pediatric neuroradiology. In this article, the different PWI techniques that render haemodynamic maps of the brain are presented and discussed. The normal developmental changes of the cerebral haemodynamics in children as measured by PWI are presented as well as the application of PWI in cerebral ischaemia, primary and secondary cerebral vasculopathies and in cerebral tumours.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-We hypothesize that in comparison to diffusion-weighted imaging, quantitative T2 values (qT2) are more directly related to water uptake in ischemic tissue, depending on time from symptom onset. We measured the increase of qT2 in the infarct core to quantify the correlation between time from symptom onset and change in qT2.
Methods-Thirty-six patients with acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the proximal middle cerebral artery underwent MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and a triple-echo T2 sequence (calculation of T2 maps) within 6 hours after symptom onset. Regions of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient <550X10(-9) mm(2)sec were defined and superimposed onto the corresponding T2 map and the unaffected side in the horizontally flipped maps. Differences of T2apparent diffusion coefficient values between affected and unaffected side were calculated (differences of T2differences of apparent diffusion coefficient). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were rated for lesion visibility.; Results-Differences of T2 showed a significant correlation with time from symptom onset (R=0.580; P<0.001). T2 values measured in patients with visible fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions were significantly higher than in those without visible hyperintensity (P<0.001). The accuracy of qT2 to predict a time from symptom onset <3 hours was 0.794, whereas the corresponding accuracy for visual assessment of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images was 0.676.; Conclusions-T2 values demonstrated a strong correlation with time from onset, suggesting different pathophysiologic mechanisms than diffusion restriction. Whereas fluid-attenuated inversion recovery only provides binary information on lesion visibility, T2 values correlate well with time from symptom onset, and are free from operator bias, increasing reproducibility to determine time from symptom onset.

N2  -  Objective
To determine the border of glial tumors by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and perfusion brain MRI.; Patients and methods; Ten patients with brain gliomas were enrolled mean age: 35.3 +- 13.2, range: 20-62. Conventional MRI was performed for all patients. Besides, tumor mapping based on Choline (Cho)Creatine (Cr) color map in MRS, perfusion and diffusion color maps, were gathered. Different tumoral and peritumoral regions normal tissue, reactive edema, infiltrative edema, and tumor core were defined. MRI criteria were evaluated in areas targeted for biopsy and histopathologic evaluation was determined.; Results; Tumor cell positive samples one necrosis, 26 infiltrative and nine tumor cores composed 36 (75%) of the 48 samples. Seven (19.4%) of the positive samples were interpreted as not tumor on MRI. Five were identified as reactive edema and two as normal tissue kappa: .67, p-value < .001. Mean of ADC, median of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and NAACho were statistically different between positive and negative samples (p = .02 and p < .001, respectively). Mean ADC and median ChoNAA were statistically different in missed tumor containing tissue presented as reactive edema compared to normal and correctly diagnosed reactive edema samples together (p-values < .05).; Conclusions; Multimodal MRI could define infiltrated borders of brain gliomas.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has had a tremendous impact on neurosurgery, particularly for patients with brain tumors. Originally a diagnostic instrument, MRI technology recently has been incorporated into the neurosurgical operative setting. High-field (1.5-Tesla) systems offer imaging resolution and capabilities comparable to a diagnostic MR scanner (e.g., diffusion-weighted imaging, functional MR, MR spectroscopy) but require special adaptation to the operative environment for safety. Intraoperative MR images can guide the neurosurgeon to achieve maximal tumor resection with minimal morbidity.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Endovascular procedures, including atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation, may cause microembolization of brain arteries. Microemboli often cause small sized and clinically silent cerebral ischemias (SCI). These lesions are clearly visible on early postoperative magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images. We analyzed SCI distribution in a population of patients submitted to atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation.
Methods Seventy-eight of 927 consecutive patients submitted to atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation were found positive for acute SCI on a postoperative magnetic resonance. SCI were identified and marked, and their coordinates were transformed from native space into the International Consortium for Brain MappingMontreal Neurological Institute space. We then computed the voxel-wise probability distribution map of the SCI using the activation likelihood estimation approach.; Results SCI were more commonly found in the cortex. In supratentorial regions, SCI selectively involved cortical border zone between anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries; in infratentorial regions, distal territory of posteroinferior cerebellar artery. Possible explanations include selective embolization, linked to the vascular anatomy of pial arteries supplying those territories, reduced clearance of emboli in a relatively hypoperfused zone, or a combination of both. This particular distribution of lesions has been reported in both animal models and in patients with microemboli of different sources.; Conclusions A selective vulnerability of cortical border zone to microemboli occurring during atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation was observed. We hypothesize that such selectivity may apply to microemboli of different sources.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Stimulation of the nerves traversing the ethmoidal foramen (including postsynaptic, parasympathetic projections from the sphenopalatine ganglion [ SPG], henceforth referred to as " SPG-stimulation") has been shown to elevate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and to be neuroprotective after permanent, middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).
Methods-Employing diffusion (DWI)-and perfusion (PWI) weighted MRI, the effect of SPG-stimulation (started at 60 minutes post-MCAO) on the spatiotemporal evolution of ischemia during and after pMCAO was investigated. In an additional experiment, regional CBF changes were investigated in the nonischemic brain.; Results-In the nonischemic brain, SPG stimulation significantly elevated CBF predominantly within areas supplied by the anterior cerebral artery (by 0.64 mLgmin relative to baseline). In the ischemic brain, CBF only marginally increased within the penumbra and core (by up to 0.08 and 0.15 mLgmin relative to prestimulation, respectively). However, the threshold-derived CBF lesion volume did not change significantly. Penumbral apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)values improved to almost baseline values and the threshold derived ADCCBF-mismatch was preserved up to 180 minutes after MCAO. TTC-derived lesion volumes were significantly smaller in stimulated versus nonstimulated animals (120.4 +-74.1 mm(3) versus 239.3 +-68.5 mm(3), respectively).; Conclusion-This study demonstrates that unilateral SPG-stimulation increases CBF bilaterally within the normal brain, acutely preserves the CBFADC mismatch largely independent of altering cerebral blood flow, and reduces infarct size in the rat permanent suture model.

N2  -  Functional diffusion map (fDM) has been recently reported as an early and quantitative biomarker of clinical brain tumor treatment outcome. This MRI approach spatially maps and quantifies treatment-induced changes in tumor water diffusion values resulting from alterations in cell density/cell membrane function and microenvironment. This current study was designed to evaluate the capability of fDM for preclinical evaluation of dose escalation studies and to determine if these changes were correlated with outcome measures (cell kill and overall survival). Serial T-2-weighted and diffusion MRI were carried out on rodents with orthotopically implanted 9L brain tumors receiving three doses of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (6.65, 13.3, and 26.6 mg/kg, i.p.). All images were coregistered to baseline T-2-weighted images for fDM analysis. Analysis of tumor fDM data on day 4 posttreatment detected dose-dependent changes in tumor diffusion values, which were also found to be spatially dependent. Histologic analysis of treated tumors confirmed spatial changes in cellularity as observed by fDM. Early changes in tumor diffusion values were found to be highly correlative with drug dose and independent biologic outcome measures (cell kill and survival). Therefore, the fDM imaging biomarker for early prediction of treatment efficacy can be used in the drug development process.

N2  -  We aim to review the imaging appearance of fulminant demyelinating disorders of central nervous system that have different pathological features, clinical course, clinical features, and imaging findings different from classic multiple sclerosis. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help in accurate localization of the lesions, detection of associated lesions, and monitoring of these patients. Advanced MRI combined with routine MRI can aid in differentiation fulminant demyelinating lesions from simulating malignancy. Tumefactive demyelination lesions are located in supratentorial white matter mainly frontal and parietal regions with incomplete rim enhancement. Balo concentric sclerosis shows characteristic concentric onion skin appearance. Schilder disease is subacute or acute demyelinating disorders with one or more lesions commonly involving the centrum semiovale. Marburg disease is the most severe demyelinating disorder with diffuse infiltrative lesions and massive edema involving both the cerebral hemisphere and brain stem.

N2  -  Little is known about the relation between fornix injury and memory impairment in diffuse axonal injury (DAD. In the current study, we attempted to investigate fornix injury in patients with memory impairment following DAI, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nine patients with DAI and nine age-and sex-matched control subjects were recruited. The DTIs were acquired using a sensitivity-encoding head coil on a 1.5 T. Five regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually on a color fractional anisotropy (FA) map: two ROIs for each column, one ROI for the body, and two ROIs for each crus. The FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in each of the ROIs. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Memory Assessment Scale, Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and Mini-Mental State Exam. In the DAI group, the FA value in the fornix body was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group. In contrast, we did not find significant differences in the column and crus of the fornix. Among all of the cognitive function scales, only the Memory Assessment Scale scores were significantly correlated with the FA values of the fornix body in the DAI group. We found that memory impairment in patients with DAI is closely related to neuronal injury of the fornix body among the three fornix regions that we assessed. DTI could be useful in the evaluation of patients with memory impairment following DAI.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: It is sometimes difficult to make a differential diagnosis between brain metastases and hemangioblastomas in the posterior fossa. We assessed whether high b value diffusion-weighted image (DWI) at b = 4000 could differentiate these tumors.
METHODS: We acquired DWI at 3-T magnetic resonance imaging with b = 1000 and b = 4000 secondsmm(2) in histologically confirmed 12 patients of hemangioblastoma without von Hippel-Lindau disease and 16 patients with brain metastases originating at the posterior fossa. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured by manually placing regions of interest on ADC maps at the site of enhanced tumor confirmed on contrast-enhanced T1- weighed image. ADC was expressed as the minimum (ADC(MIN)), mean (ADC(MEAN)), and maximum (ADC(MAX)) values.; RESULTS: All the ADC values of hemangioblastomas were statistically higher than those of metastatic tumor in both b = 1000 and b = 4000 (P < 0.0001 in ADC(MIN), ADC(MEAN), and ADC(MAX); Mann-Whitney U test). With the cutoff value at 0.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)second, the positive predictive value of ADC(MIN) at b = 4000 was higher than that of ADC(MIN) at b = 1000 (100% vs. 89.3%, logistic analysis) to differentiate hemangioblastomas from brain metastases. Moreover, we studied the pathologic subtype of hemangioblastoma and confirmed that ADCs (b = 4000(MIN)) of cellular subtype were statistically lower than those of reticular subtype (P = 0.03; Mann-Whitney U test).; CONCLUSIONS: High b value DWI reflects diffusion more accurately than does regular b value. Our results showed that ADC calculation by high b value (b = 4000) DWI at 3-T magnetic resonance imaging is clinically useful for differentiating hemangioblastomas from brain metastases.

N2  -  The concept of a topographical map of the corpus callosum (CC), the main interhemispheric commissure, has emerged from human lesion studies and from anatomical tracing investigations in other mammals. Over the last few years, a rising number of researchers have been reporting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation in also the CC.This short review summarizes the functional and behavioral studies performed in groups of healthy subjects and in patients undergone to partial or total callosal resection, and it is focused on the work conducted by the authors. Functional data have been collected by diffusion tensor imaging and tractography (DTI and DTT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), both techniques allowing to expand and refine our knowledge of the commissure. Neuropsychological test were also administered, and simple behavioral task, as imitation perspective and mental rotation ability, were analyzed. These researches added new insight on the topographic organization of the human CC. By combining DTT and fMRI it was possible to observe that the callosal crossing points of interhemispheric fibers connecting homologous primary sensory cortices, correspond to the CC sites where the fMRI activation elicited by peripheral stimulation was detected. In addition, CC activation during imitation and mental rotation performance was also reported.These studies demonstrated the presence of specific callosal fiber tracts that cross the commissure in the genu, body, and splenium, at sites showing fMRI activation, consistently with cortical activated areas. Altogether, these findings lend further support to the notion that the CC displays a functional topographic organization, also related to specific behavior.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Severe perinatal asphyxia is an important cause of brain injury in the newborn infant. We examined early events after hypoxic ischemia (HI) in the 7-day-old mouse brain by MRI and related them to long-term functional effects and histopathology in the same animals at 4 to 5 weeks of age.
Methods-HI was induced in 7-day-old CD1 mice by exposure to 8% oxygen for 30 minutes after occlusion of the left common carotid artery. The resulting unilateral focal lesion was evaluated in vivo by MRI (T2 maps and apparent diffusion coefficient maps) at 3, 6, and 24 hours and 5 days after hypoxia. Locomotion and sensorimotor function were analyzed after 3 weeks. Four weeks after HI, the mice were killed. and cresyl violet-stained brain sections were examined morphologically.; Results-A decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient values in cortex on the affected side was found at 3 hours after HI. T2 values were significantly increased after 6 hours and remained so for 5 days. Maximal size of the lesion was attained at 3 to 6 hours after HI and declined thereafter. Animals with MRI-detected lesions had decreased forward locomotion. performed worse than controls in the beam-walking test. and showed a unilateral hypotrophy in the cresyl violet-stained brain sections 4 weeks later.; Conclusions-The temporal progression of the damage after HI in 7-day-old mice differs from that of the adult brain as judged by MRI. The early lesions detected by MRI were related to functional impairments for these mice in near-adult life.

N2  -  Diagnostic modalities that can distinguish brain tumors from eloquent cortices or nerve fiber bundles are important for neurosurgery. For identifying nerve fiber bundles, various techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and subcortical stimulation mapping have been used. In this article, we propose localization of nerve fiber bundles by polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) for the first time. PS-OCT performs tomographic imaging by measuring the travel distance and the change in polarization of the backscattered light from the tissue at different traverse positions, enabling selective visualization of birefringent tissues such as nerve fiber bundles. We examined the imaging of nerve fiber bundles in blocks of fixed rat brains. Nerve fiber bundles in internal and external capsules of the rat brains appearing on the surfaces of the coronal, horizontal, and sagittal planes were identified as to their locations and orientations. The nerve fiber bundles were clearly visualized by PS-OCT. The image penetration depth of the PS-OCT images was about 1.0 mm in gray matter and about 0.5 mm in white matter, so the refractive indices of gray and white matters were assumed to be 1.4.

N2  -  Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a coexisting internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis on lesion volumes as well as diffusion and perfusion parameters in acute ischemic stroke resulting from middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.
Material and methods: Magnetic resonance imaging data of 32 patients with MCA occlusion with or without additional ICA stenosis imaged within 4.5 h of symptom onset were analyzed. Both groups consisted of 16 patients. Acute diffusion lesions were semiautomatically segmented in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MRI datasets. Perfusion maps of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow, mean transit time and T-max were calculated using perfusion-weighted MRI datasets. Tissue-at-risk (TAR) volumes were generated by subtracting the ADC lesion from the hypoperfusion lesion defined by T-max >6 s. Median ADC and perfusion parameter values were extracted separately for the diffusion lesion and TAR and used for statistical analysis.; Results: No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the diffusion lesion and TAR volumes. Statistical analysis of diffusion and perfusion parameters revealed CBV as the only parameter with a significant difference (p = 0.009) contributing a small effect (eta(2) = 0.11) to the group comparison with higher CBV values for the patient group with a coexisting ICA stenosis, while no significant effects were found for the other diffusion and perfusion parameters analyzed.; Conclusion:The results of this study suggest that a coexisting ICA stenosis does not have a strong effect on tissue status or perfusion parameters in acute stroke patients except for a moderate elevation of CBV. This may reflect improved collateral circulation or ischemic preconditioning in patients with a pre-existing proximal stenosis balancing impaired perfusion from the stenosis.

N2  -  To date, the structural characteristics that distinguish language-involved from non-involved cortical areas are largely unclear. Particularly in patients suffering from language-eloquent brain tumors, reliable mapping of the cortico-subcortical language network is of high clinical importance to prepare and guide safe tumor resection. To investigate differences in structural characteristics between language-positive and language-negative areas, 20 patients (mean age: 63.2 +/- 12.9 years, 16 males) diagnosed with language-eloquent left-hemispheric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) underwent preoperative language mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT). The number of language-positive and language-negative points as well as the gray matter intensity (GMI), normalized volumes of U-fibers, interhemispheric fibers, and fibers projecting to the cerebellum were assessed and compared between language-positive and language-negative nTMS mappings and set in correlation with aphasia grades. We found significantly lower GMI for language-positive nTMS points (5.7 +/- 1.7 versus 7.1 +/- 1.6,p= 0.0121). Furthermore, language-positive nTMS points were characterized by an enhanced connectivity profile, i.e., these points showed a significantly higher ratio in volumes for U-fibers (p <= 0.0056), interhemispheric fibers (p= 0.0494), and fibers projecting to the cerebellum (p= 0.0094). The number of language-positive nTMS points (R >= 0.4854,p <= 0.0300) as well as the ratio in volumes for U-fibers (R <= -0.4899, p <= 0.0283) were significantly associated with aphasia grades, as assessed pre- or postoperatively and during follow-up examinations. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for structural differences on cortical and subcortical levels between language-positive and language-negative areas, as detected by nTMS language mapping. The results may further increase confidence in the technique of nTMS language mapping and nTMS-based tractography in the direct clinical setting. Future studies may confirm our results in larger cohorts and may expand the findings to patients with other tumor entities than GBM.

N2  -  Objective: The aims of this Study of patients with high-grade gliomas in eloquent brain areas were 1) to assess the postoperative functional outcome, 2) to determine the extent of tumour resection in these difficult locations, 3) to evaluate the practical usefulness of navigated blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor tractography.
Patients and Methods: 25 consecutive patients were included in the study. The patients' gross functional neurological status was determined using the 7-step modified Rankin scale. The extent of tumour resection was determined using pre- and postoperative T(1)-weighted or T(1)-weighted, contrast-enhanced MRI images.; Results: The average preoperative modified Rankin scale was 1.56 +- 0.77, whereas the average postoperative modified Rankin scale was 1.08 +- 1.29. There was a significant improvement in mean modified Rankin scale score after Surgery. The mean percentage of residual tumour was calculated to 16 +- 22% of the original tumour Volume (median 8%). Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor tractography were performed in 23 and 18 patients, respectively. Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor tractography facilitated identification of probable functional regions in 91% and 94% of the respective investigations.; Conclusion: We feel that the combination of blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor tractography, and 3D ultrasound facilitated maximal tumour resection with minimal deficits. The method permits an image-based functional monitoring of the brain during surgery that may aid the preservation of motor and language function.

N2  -  MRI in two children with moya-moya demonstrated low signal on T2-weighted images in the acute and subacute phases of ischaemia. Gradient-echo sequences, more sensitive to magnetic susceptibility, demonstrated these abnormalities better. Signal loss, due to temporary accumulation of iron, decreases progressively and disappears in the chronic stage of the disease. Diffusion-weighted MRI allows early detection of ischaemic lesions and can be used to monitor progressive spreading of the lesions. Magnetisation transfer maps provide sharp contrast, useful for demonstrating cortical atrophy.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging has been used extensively in clinical practice for the early diagnosis of central nervous system conditions that restrict the diffusion of water molecules because it provides information about tumor cellularity or abscesses containing viscous fluid. DTI can detect brain lesions before any conventional imaging. Even though the role of these modalities is well defined for many neurologic lesions that affect the brain, its clinical application in spinal cord diseases is increasing. This article discusses the several central nervous system conditions that may be diagnosed with diffusion imaging.

N2  -  Recently, gray and white matter volumetric studies of the brain have been adjusted with measured brain diffusion scalar values, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). This is carried out mainly to determine the existence of manifested abnormal water diffusivity. This paper developed a method to quantify the diffusion tensor changes among right and left hemispheres. Morphological differences between the hemorrhagic brain injury and healthy subjects are investigated. Specifically, the diffusion orientation and the integrity of the white matter are expressed by the FA. Diffusion characteristics along the axial and radial directions and the mean diffusivity are assessed. The associated diffusivities are related to the diffusion tensor shape for each hemisphere and for the entire brain, based on linear, planar, and spherical measurements in a three-phase plot. This procedure is used to map and to compare changes in the anisotropy from healthy to hemorrhagic brain injury. These measures are combined and acted as a filtering technique. Only those possible macro structural diffusion measures, which are important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization or fiber-tract degradation, are retained. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides some anisotropy measures to efficiently and to accurately discriminate between the brain injuries. Furthermore, it is an established fact that the FA performs better to separate between healthy and temporal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and ischemic stroke (IS)-induced brain injury subjects, whereas the radial diffusivity was more appropriate to discriminate between the left and right hemispheres versus the whole brain for ICH and IS subjects.

N2  -  Advanced MRI techniques, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion MR imaging can give important in vivo physiological and metabolic information, complementing morphologic findings from conventional MRI in the clinical setting. Combining perfusion MRI and MR spectroscopy can help in patients with brain masses in who the pre-operative differential diagnosis is unclear. This review demonstrates the use of dynamic, susceptibility weighted, contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DSC MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to distinguish surgical from non-surgical lesions in the brain. There is overlap in the MRI appearance of many enhancing and ring-enhancing lesions such as gliomas, metastases, inflammatory lesions, demyelinating lesions, subacute ischemia, abscess and some AIDS related lesions. We review examples of histopathologically confirmed high-grade glioma, a middle cerebral artery territory infarct, a turnefactive demyelinating lesion and a metastasis for which conventional MR imaging (MRI) was non-specific and potentially misleading and demonstrate how DSC MRI and MRSI features were used to increase the specificity of neurodiagnosis.
At several institutions, many patients routinely undergo MRI as well as MRSI and DSC MRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements are obtained from regions of maximal perfusion as determined from perfusion color overlay maps. Metabolite levels and ratios are determined for Choline (Cho), N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA), Lactate and Lipids (LL). Metabolite levels are obtained by measuring the peak heights of each metabolite and the ratios are obtained from these measurements for ChoCr, ChoNAA and NAACr.; Neurosurgical intervention carries substantial morbidity, mortality, financial and potential emotional cost to the patient and family. Making a pre-operative diagnosis allows the neurosurgeon to be confident in the choice of treatment plan for the patient and allays considerable patient anxiety. The utility of combining clinical findings with multi-parametric information from perfusion and spectroscopic MR imaging in differentiating surgical lesions from those which do not require surgical intervention is discussed.

N2  -  Cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in rodents has been proposed as an experimental model of white matter damage and vascular dementia. However, the histopathological and behavioral alterations reported in this model are variable and a full characterization of the dynamic alterations is not available. Here we implemented a longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) design, including time-of-flight angiography, high resolution T1-weighted images, T2 relaxometry mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and cerebral blood flow measurements up to 12 weeks after BCCAo or sham-operation in Wistar rats. Changes in MRI were related to behavioral performance in executive function tasks and histopathological alterations in the same animals. MRI frequently (70%) showed various degrees of acute ischemic lesions, ranging from very small to large subcortical infarctions. Independently, delayed MRI changes were also apparent. The patterns of MRI alterations were related to either ischemic necrosis or gliosis. Progressive microstructural changes revealed by diffusion tensor imaging in white matter were confirmed by observation of myelinated fiber degeneration, including severe optic tract degeneration. The latter interfered with the visually cued learning paradigms used to test executive functions. Independently of brain damage, BCCAo induced progressive arteriogenesis in the vertebrobasilar tree, a process that was associated with blood flow recovery after 12 weeks. The structural alterations found in the basilar artery were compatible with compensatory adaptive changes driven by shear stress. In summary, BCCAo in rats induces specific signatures in multimodal MRI that are compatible with various types of histological lesion and with marked adaptive arteriogenesis.

N2  -  Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a new type diffusion-weighted sequence which measures the non-Gaussianity of water diffusion. The present study aimed to investigate whether the parameters of DKI could distinguish between differences in water molecule diffusion in various brain regions under the conditions of acute infarction and to identify the optimal DKI parameter for locating ischemic lesions in each brain region. A total of 28 patients with acute ischemic stroke in different brain regions were recruited for the present study. The relative values of DKI parameters were selected as major assessment indices, and the homogeneity of background image and contrast of adjacent structures were used as minor assessment indices. According to the brain region involved in three DKI parametric maps, including mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (Ka) and radial kurtosis (Kr), 112 groups of regions of interest were outlined in the following regions: Corpus callosum (n= 17); corona radiata (n= 26); thalamus (n= 21); subcortical white matter (n= 24); and cerebral cortex (n= 24). For ischemic lesions in the corpus callosum and corona radiata, significant increases in relative Ka were detected, as compared with the other parameters (P< 0.05). For ischemic lesions in the thalamus, subcortical white matter and cerebral cortices, an increase in the three parameters was detected, however this difference was not significant. Minor assessment indices demonstrated that Ka lacked tissue contrast and the background of Kr was heterogeneous; thus, MK was the superior assessment parameter for ischemic lesions in these regions. In conclusion, Ka is better suited for the diagnosis of acute ischemic lesions in highly anisotropic brain regions, such as the corpus callosum and corona radiate. MK may be appropriate for the lesions in low anisotropic or isotropic brain regions, such as the thalamus, subcortical white matter and cerebral cortices.

N2  -  Surgical resection of gliomas involving eloquent brain areas must be maximal in order to improve patients' survival, and safe to prevent postoperative impairments. Therefore, the precise spatial relationship between the lesion and eloquent brain areas needs to be established. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging are robust methods with increasing indications in neurosurgery for past decade. The aim of this review article is not only to pinpoint the major limitations of these methods in order to avoid erroneous conclusions, but also to detail practical aspects associated with the main paradigms routinely used in functional magnetic resonance imaging, and to discuss recent validation of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging results with direct electrical stimulation during awake surgery.

N2  -  Background-In this study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the pattern of cortical activations after a simple motor task in patients with migraine and white matter (WM) abnormalities on conventional MRI scans of the brain. We also investigated whether the extent of brain activations was correlated with WM structural pathology measured using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI.
Methods-From 15 right-handed patients with migraine and 15 sex- and age-matched, right-handed healthy volunteers, we obtained the following: (1) fMRI (repetitive flexion-extension of the last 4 fingers of the right hand), (2) dual-echo turbo spin echo scans, and (3) pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar sequence to calculate DT-MRI maps. fMRI analysis was performed using SPM99 and cluster detection. We measured the volume, the average mean diffusivity (D), and the average fractional anisotropy of all lesions seen on the dual-echo scans. D histograms of the normal-appearing WM were also produced.; Results-Compared with healthy volunteers, migraine patients had a larger relative activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (P=0.01) and a rostral displacement of the supplementary motor area (P=0.03). The shapes of the curves reflecting the time course for fMRI signal intensity changes were similar between migraine patients and controls for all of the cortical areas we studied. Compared with healthy subjects, migraine patients had significantly lower D histogram peak height of the normal-appearing WM histogram (P=0.02), which was found to be correlated with the extent of displacement of the supplementary motor area (r=-0.80, P<0.001).; Conclusions-This study suggests that functional cortical changes occur in patients with migraine and brain MRI abnormalities and that they might be secondary to the extent of subcortical structural damage.

N2  -  The human brain thalami play essential roles in integrating cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) measurements of the thalami provide important biomarkers of disease progression, but late development and aging confound the interpretation of data collected from patients over a wide age range. Thalamic tissue volume loss due to natural aging and its interplay with lesion-driven pathology has not been investigated previously. In this work, we used standardized thalamic volumetry combined with diffusion tensor imaging, T2 relaxometry, and lesion mapping on large cohorts of controls (N = 255, age range = 6.2-69.1 years) and MS patients (N = 109, age range = 20.8-68.5 years) to demonstrate early age- and lesion-independent thalamic neurodegeneration.

N2  -  To evaluate microstructural cerebral changes in children suffering from typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. For 12 pediatric HUS patients (0.8 - 14.6 years of age) conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) at 1.5 T was retrospectively analyzed. ADC values were measured in 35 different brain regions and compared with age-related, previously published ADC reference values from a healthy pediatric control group. The HUS cohort was divided into 2 subgroups depending on clinical outcome. Subgroup A showed poor neurological outcome whereas subgroup B demonstrated improvement without lasting neurological deficits. Qualitative analysis revealed lesions by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with hypointense correlate on the ADC map in basal ganglia and/or thalami and corresponding T2 hyperintensities in the majority of patients in Subgroup A (80%). Those in Subgroup B did not show qualitative DWI alterations with ADC correlate even when T2 hyperintense lesions were detected in basal ganglia and/or thalami. Quantitative analysis demonstrated abnormal ADC values in all HUS patients with a trend to a greater number of affected regions in Subgroup A compared to Subgroup B (16 versus 11 median number of regions respectively, p = 0.56).
Conclusion: Using DWI qualitative and quantitative differences were found between HUS patients showing poor neurological outcome and those without neurological deficits at discharge. While ADC values indicated more extensive cerebral changes than conventional qualitative findings, both may provide early prognostic indicators for neurological outcome in pediatric HUS patients.; What is Known: circle In patients with STEC-HUS and neurological symptoms, MRI may show hyperintense signals on T2 and altered diffusivity mostly affecting basal ganglia, thalami and periventricular white matter.; What is New: circle In such patients, early MRI including quantitative ADC measurements over different brain regions may allow for detection of signal alterations possibly reflecting microstructural changes in such patients.

N2  -  PurposeThe sensitivity of the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for early detection of brain metastases was investigated in mice and humans.
MethodsMice underwent MRI twice weekly for up to 31 d following intracardiac injection of the brain-homing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231-BR. Patients with small cell lung cancer underwent quarterly MRI for 1 year. MTR and ADC were measured in regions of metastasis and matched contralateral tissue at the final time point and in registered regions at earlier time points. Texture analysis and linear discriminant analysis were performed to detect metastasis-containing slices.; ResultsCompared with contralateral tissue, mouse metastases had significantly lower MTR and higher ADC at the final time point. Some lesions were visible at earlier time points on the MTR and ADC maps: 24% of these were not visible on corresponding T-2-weighted images. Texture analysis using the MTR maps showed 100% specificity and 98% sensitivity for metastasis at the final time point, with 77% sensitivity 2-4 d earlier and 46% 5-8 d earlier. Only 2 of 16 patients developed metastases, and their penultimate scans were normal.; ConclusionsSome brain metastases may be detected earlier on MTR than conventional T-2; however, the small gain is unlikely to justify predictive MRI.

N2  -  The internal capsule conveys information from primary and supplementary motor areas, frontopontine and thalamic peduncles to brain stem and cerebellar regions, and from thalamus to prefrontal cortex. Neurological accidents involving the internal capsule indicate differential functional correlates with its sectors. To examine the microstructural condition of this fiber system and to test functional correlates of its sectors in health and aging, 12 younger and 12 older adults were examined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking and neuropsychological tests. Greater age-related degradation was evident in the anterior than posterior limb and in the superior than inferior division of the internal capsule. The superior division age effect was especially notable in axial and radial diffusivity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) across the three (anterior, genu, posterior) fiber bundles of the inferior division accounted for 27-73% of the variance for each neuropsychological domain. Identification of a triple dissociation indicated selective correlations between anterior FA and set shifting, genu FA and motor skills, and posterior FA and fluency. Quantitative fiber tracking combined with assessment of cognitive and motor functions enabled the identification of selective brain structure-function relations in healthy adults without lesions that were previously observed only in patients with lesions of the internal capsule.

N2  -  Functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used as a non-invasive method for the evaluation of pre-operation motor function. However, patients with cortical function impairment, such as those with hemiparesis, can rarely achieve hand clenching, a typical fMRI task for central sulcus identification, and the method is also of limited use in uncooperative children. Thus, it is important to develop a new method for identifying primary motor areas (PMA) in such individuals. This study used corticospinal tractography to identify the PMA in 20 patients with deep-seated brain tumor. Two regions of interest were set within the brainstem for corticospinal tract (CST) fiber tracking: one at the level of the pons and the other at the level of the cerebral peduncle. The CST fiber tracking results and fMRI activation signals were merged with three-dimensional anatomic MRI findings. The consistency of identifying the PMP, by CST and fMRI was analyzed. fMRI activation signals were distributed mainly in the contralateral central sulcus around the omega-shaped hand knob. The CST consistently propagated from the pons and cerebral peduncle to the suspected PMA location. There was a good correlation between CST fiber tracking results and fMRI activation signals in terms of their abilities to identify the PMA. The differences between fMRI and CST fiber tracking findings may result from our functional task, which consisted only of hand movements. Our results indicate that diffusion tensor imaging is a useful brain mapping technique for identifying the PMA in paralyzed patients and uncooperative children.

N2  -  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography is a noninvasive technique that enables the visualization and quantification of white matter tracts within the brain. It is extensively used in preoperative planning for brain tumors, epilepsy, and functional neurosurgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation. Over the past 25 years, significant advancements have been made in imaging acquisition, fiber direction estimation, and tracking methods, resulting in considerable improvements in tractography accuracy. The technique enables the mapping of functionally critical pathways around surgical sites to avoid permanent functional disability. When the limitations are adequately acknowledged and considered, tractography can serve as a valuable tool to safeguard critical white matter tracts and provides insight regarding changes in normal white matter and structural connectivity of the whole brain beyond local lesions. In functional neurosurgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation, it plays a significant role in optimizing stimulation sites and parameters to maximize therapeutic efficacy and can be used as a direct target for therapy. These insights can aid in patient risk stratification and prognosis. This article aims to discuss state-of-the-art tractography methodologies and their applications in preoperative planning and highlight the challenges and new prospects for the use of tractography in daily clinical practice.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can be used to distinguish brain abscesses from cystic or necrotic brain tumors, which are difficult to distinguish by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Methods: Eleven consecutive patients with brain abscesses [10 pyogenic and I toxoplasmosis (in an AIDS patient)] and 15 with cystic or necrotic brain gliomas or metastases were enrolled in this study. None of these lesions had apparent hemorrhage based on T1-weighted image (T1W1). The DWI was performed using a 1.5-T system, single-shot spin-echo echo-planar pulse sequence with b = 1000 s/mm(2). The ADC was calculated using a two-point linear regression method at b = 0 and b = 1000 s/ mm(2). The ratio (ADCR) of the lesion ADC to control region ADC was also measured. Results: Increased signal was seen in all of the pyogenic abscess cavities to variable degrees on DWI. In vivo ADC maps showed restricted diffusion in the abscess cavity in all pyogenic abscesses [0.65 +/- 0.16 x 10(-3) (mean +/- S.D.) mm(2)/s, mean ADCR = 0.63]. The case with multiple toxoplasmosis abscesses showed low signal intensity on DWI and high ADC values (mean 1.9 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, ADCR = 2.24). All cystic or necrotic tumors but one showed low signal intensity on DWI and their cystic or necrotic areas had high ADC values (2.70 +/- 0.31 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, mean ADCR = 3.42). One fibrillary low-grade astrocytoma had a high DWI signal intensity and a low ADC value in its central cystic area (0.44 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, ADCR = 0.49). Postcontrast TlWls yielded a sensitivity of 60%, a specificity of 27.27%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.94%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 33.33% in the diagnosis of necrotic tumors. DWI yielded a sensitivity of 93.33%, a specificity of 90.91%, a PPVof 93.33%, and a NPV of 90.91%. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for postcontrast TlWl was 0.44 and DWI was 0.92. Analysis of these areas under the ROC curves indicates significant difference between postcontrast TlWl and DWI (P<.001). Conclusion: With some exceptions, DWI is useful in providing a greater degree of confidence in distinguishing brain abscesses from cystic or necrotic brain tumors than conventional MRI and seems to be a valuable diagnostic tool.

N2  -  The sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MR imaging to detect a lesion within 6 hours of stroke onset was approximately 90%. The false negative results were usually small lesions (less than or equal to 1 ml), were seen early, and were usually located in the brain stem. The specificity of this technique was nearly 100% when it was used correctly. The volume and the value of the apparent diffusion coefficient of the detected lesions provided prognostic information. After injection of a contrast agent (perfusion imaging), a time series of volumes were obtained using a T2* sensitive gradient echo EPI sequence. Hemodynamic perturbations of the cerebral parenchyma could be detected as well as the type of perturbation in the lesion. A map representing the mean transit time for each voxel was used to define the maximum volume of the perturbation. A hemodynamic penumbra was defined to be when this volume was larger than the volume detected on the diffusion images. The quantitative measure of cerebral blood flow could predict the irreversibility of the lesions when the value was below 18ml/min/100g, and the extension of the ischemia in the penumbra zone when the value was below a threshold of 30ml/min/100g.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are the most common neoplasms in adults. When brain metastases are located in eloquent areas, their treatment still seems controversial and not clearly defined. It is therefore essential to provide correct preoperative planning to better define extension and characterization of brain metastasis.
METHODS: We retrospectively looked for the tumor database of our institution, patients with single brain metastasis, located in the sylvian area, who underwent resection with the support of intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring between 2008 and 2018.; RESULTS: We retrieved data for 30 adults, each with a single brain metastasis that was located in the sylvian area, including the insula and the lower portion of the motor cortex. Neuronavigation and the intraoperative visualization of the navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation-based reconstruction of functional networks were used to delineate the ideal trajectory toward the lesion. The Karnofsky Performance Status significantly improved in the postoperative period.; CONCLUSIONS: The correct planning of brain metastasis allows more secure removal of the neoplastic lesion, avoiding andor reducing the appearance of neurologic deficits. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation represents a new method that can promote a more complete and safer resection of the metastatic lesion in eloquent areas. An optimal surgical result, in the absence of postoperative neurologic deficits, allows the patient to undertake adjuvant therapy able to prolong survival.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Surgery for tumors in eloquent brain faces immense challenges when attempting to maximize resection and avoid neurological deficits.
OBJECTIVE: In order to give the surgeon real-time atlas-based anatomic information linked to the patient's anatomy, we developed a software-based interface between deformable anatomic templates (DATs) and an intraoperative navigation system.; METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging, andor functional MRI were performed on 3 patients preoperatively for the purposes of tumor resection by the use of neuronavigation. The DAT was registered to the patients' navigation coordinate system and utilized coordinates from the navigation system during surgery. This provided the surgeon with a list of proximal anatomic and functional structures and a real-time image of the atlas at that location fused to the patient's MRI. The clinical feasibility of this approach was evaluated during the resection of 3 eloquent tumors (right postcentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left occipital cuneus gyrus).; RESULTS: Tumor resection was performed successfully in all 3 patients. With the use of the coordinates from the navigation system, anatomic and functional structures and their distances were visualized interactively during tumor resection by using the DAT.; CONCLUSION: This is a proof of concept that an interactive atlas-based navigation can provide detailed anatomic and functional information that supplements MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI. The atlas-based navigation generated distances to important anatomic structures from the navigation probe tip. It can be used to guide direct electrical stimulation and highlight areas to avoid during tumor resection.

N2  -  Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) are believed to play an important role in a subset of patients with late-onset depression by affecting the white matter connectivity in circuitries essential for mood and cognition. In this study we used diffusion tensor imaging-based (DTI-based) tractography to assess white matter fiber tracts affected by deep WMLs (DWMLs) in patients with late-onset major depression and age- and gender-matched controls. Tractography outcome, illustrated as pathways affected by DWMLs, was analyzed for associations with cognitive performance on the Stroop Test (ST). The patients (n = 17) performed significantly worse on the ST than the controls (n = 22). Poor performance on the ST correlated with higher lesion load. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between poor performance on the ST and tracts affected by DWMLs in multiple brain areas in the control group, but very sparse correlation in the patient group. Our results suggest that DWMLs play an important role in the cognitive performance of controls,whereas their influence in depressed patients is overruled by additional, state-dependent factors. Future focus on the tract-specific localization of WMLs using DTI tractography may reveal important associations between neuroconnectivity and clinical measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Background: Ganglioneuroma is a rare benign tumor originating from the sympathetic nerves, and its origination from the trigeminal nerves is even rarer. Only 4 cases of ganglioneuroma originating from the trigeminal nerve have previously been reported, and these studies only reported conventional MRI manifestations. To our knowledge, the advanced MRI features of trigeminal ganglioneuroma have not been reported thus far.
Case presentation: This study reports a case of trigeminal ganglioneuroma in the left cerebellopontine angle. Advanced MRI showed the following tumor characteristics: significantly increased perfusion on perfusion imaging; isointense on diffusion-weighted imaging, whorled appearance within the tumor and no significant signs of damage to the white matter fiber tracts in the fractional anisotropy color map, and compare to the adjacent brain tissue, Choline didn't show markedly elevation, and N-acetylaspartate peak showed slightly reduction on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The tumor was completely resected, and the diagnosis of ganglioneuroma was confirmed by postoperative pathological examination.; Conclusion: This case demonstrates the conventional as well as advanced MRI manifestations of this rare extra-axial tumor, which have never been previously reported. In addition, we reviewed the literature to demonstrate the advanced MRI features of trigeminal ganglioneuroma, in order to aid preoperative diagnosis and differentiation.

N2  -  In this study, neuro-levelset method is proposed and evaluated for segmentation and grading of brain tumors on reconstructed images of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance images. The proposed neuro-levelset method comprises of two independent phases of processing. At first, reconstructed images have been independently processed by three different artificial neural network systems such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), self-organizing map (SOM), and radial basis function (RBF). The images used for these tasks were the cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (TIP), percentage of base at peak (PBP) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images. This processing step ensued in formation of segmentation images of brain tumors. Further, in the second phase, these coarse segmented images of each artificial neural network system have been independently subjected as speed images to levelset method in order to optimize the segmentation performance. This has resulted in construction of three distinct neuro-levelset methods such as MLP-levelset. SOM-levelset and RBF-levelset method. Proposed neuro-levelset methods performed better in segmenting tumor, edema, necrosis, CSF and normal tissues as compared to independent artificial neural network systems. Among three neuro-levelset methods, RBF-levelset system has performed well with average sensitivity and specificity values of 91.43 +/- 2.94% and 94.43 +/- 1.90%, respectively.

N2  -  Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) non-invasively provides maps of microscopic structural information of oriented tissue in vivo, which is finding utility in studies of the aging population. In contrast to the white matter maturation process, investigators have observed significant declines in the white matter ordering in normal as well as in abnormal aging. These studies suggest that water proton non-random, anisotropic diffusion measured by DTI is highly sensitive to otherwise subtle disease processes not normally seen with conventional MRI tissue contrast mechanisms.

N2  -  Central nervous system neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB FOXR2) has recently been described as a class of brain tumors sharing common genetic events and a highly similar DNA methylation profile. Most of these tumors have previously been diagnosed as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Whereas the entity of PNET has been removed from the WHO classification of brain tumors in its current edition, CNS neuroblastoma was kept as an entity, but still lacks any molecular detail. Here, we describe 8 cases of CNS NB FOXR2 focusing on histomorphological and immunohistochemical features and include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 2 of these cases. MRI revealed large supratentorial masses in superficial location with prominent cysts and necrosis, but little edema. Diffusion and enhancement characteristics were variable. Histological analyses showed that most of the cases displayed neuronal differentiation with necrosis, endothelial proliferation, and high vascularity. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong expression of synaptophysin, MAP2, and OLIG2 as well as moderate proliferation. These findings suggest that tumors with the molecular diagnosis of CNS NB FOXR2 may fit well into the WHO entity of CNS neuroblastoma. Our findings may be helpful when establishing an integrated diagnosis and may be indispensable if molecular data are unavailable.

N2  -  Introduction To determine whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings combined with initial clinical factors indicate the depth of shearing lesions in the brain structure and therefore relate to coma duration in diffuse axonal injury (DAI).
Methods A total of 74 adult patients (48 male and 26 female) with DAI were examined with conventional MR imaging and diffusion-weighted MR imaging between 2 hours and 20 days after injury. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained and the mean ADC values of each region of interest (ROI) were measured using MRI console software. The involvement of the brainstem, deep gray matter, and corpus callosum was determined for each sequence separately as well as for the combination of all sequences. The correlations between MR imaging findings indicating the presence of apparent brain injury combined with initial clinical factors were determined.; Results Clinical characteristics, such as initial score on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), age and number of all lesions, and ADC scores were predictive of the duration of coma.; Conclusion It was possible to predict post-traumatic coma duration in DAI from cerebral MR imaging findings combined with clinical prognostic factors in the acute to subacute stage after head injury. Age, ADC scores, GCS score and number of lesions were highly significant in predicting coma duration. The technique presented here might provide a tool for in vivo detection of DAI to allow the prediction of the coma duration during the early stages in patients with traumatic brain injury.

N2  -  AIM: To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), blood oxygen level-dependent imaging (BOLD) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for preoperative assessment in patients with brain gliomas.
MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive glioma patients underwent MRS, BOLD and DTI before operation. The characteristics of images were analysed according to histopathological results.; RESULTS: There is significant elevation of the choline (Cho)creatine (Cr) ratio, Cho peak and depression of the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak in gliomas. Elevation of the ChoCr, ChoNAA ratio and the presence of a lipids peak, were consistent with high-grade malignancy. A motor activation scan was achieved by using a motor task paradigm in 20 patients. Deformation and displacement of the motor activations was found in 5 cases. The margin of tumor and peritumoural white matter tracts were identified using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Three patterns of white matter tracts alteration were identified: displacement, infiltration, and disruption. In all 23 patients, the tumors were completely resected in 6 patients, subtotal resected in 8 patients, partial resected in 9 patients. No secondary neurological deficit was occurred in all patients after operation.; CONCLUSION:The combination of MRS, BOLD, and DTI techniques allows appropriate presurgical planning of brain gliomas.

N2  -  Background Peritumoral edema alters diffusion anisotropy, resulting in false negatives in tractography reconstructions negatively impacting surgical decision-making. With supratotal resections tied to survival benefit in glioma patients, advanced diffusion modeling is critical to visualize fibers within the peritumoral zone to prevent eloquent fiber transection thereafter. A preoperative assessment paradigm is therefore warranted to systematically evaluate multi-subject tractograms along clinically meaningful parameters. We propose a novel noninvasive surgically-focused survey to evaluate the benefits of a tractography algorithm for preoperative planning, subsequently applied to Synaptive Medical's free-water correction algorithm developed for clinically feasible single-shell DTI data.Methods Ten neurosurgeons participated in the study and were presented with patient datasets containing histological lesions of varying degrees of edema. They were asked to compare standard (uncorrected) tractography reconstructions overlaid onto anatomical images with enhanced (corrected) reconstructions. The raters assessed the datasets in terms of overall data quality, tract alteration patterns, and the impact of the correction on lesion definition, brain-tumor interface, and optimal surgical pathway. Inter-rater reliability coefficients were calculated, and statistical comparisons were made.Results Standard tractography was perceived as problematic in areas proximal to the lesion, presenting with significant tract reduction that challenged assessment of the brain-tumor interface and of tract infiltration. With correction applied, significant reduction in false negatives were reported along with additional insight into tract infiltration. Significant positive correlations were shown between favorable responses to the correction algorithm and the lesion-to-edema ratio, such that the correction offered further clarification in increasingly edematous and malignant lesions. Lastly, the correction was perceived to introduce false tracts in CSF spaces and - to a lesser degree - the grey-white matter interface, highlighting the need for noise mitigation. As a result, the algorithm was modified by free-water-parameterizing the tractography dataset and introducing a novel adaptive thresholding tool for customizable correction guided by the surgeon's discretion.Conclusion Here we translate surgeon insights into a clinically deployable software implementation capable of recovering peritumoral tracts in edematous zones while mitigating artifacts through the introduction of a novel and adaptive case-specific correction tool. Together, these advances maximize tractography's clinical potential to personalize surgical decisions when faced with complex pathologies.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEThough diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for diagnosing many pathologies, its use in infectious spondylodiscitis is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the use of DW MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping for the diagnosis of infectious spondylodiscitis.
METHODSIn this retrospective study, 17 patients with confirmed infectious spondylodiscitis were matched by age and level of infected disc with 17 patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) and 17 healthy controls. All patients received conventional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the same imaging session. ADC values of the 3 groups of patients were compared.; RESULTSThe mean age of each group was 67.4 11.6 years. The mean ADCs of the normal control, DDD, and infectious spondylodiscitis groups were 1.76 +- 0.19 x 10(-3), 1.12 +- 0.22 x 10(-3), and 1.27 +- 0.38 x 10(-3) mm(2)second, respectively. The ADCs of the DDD and infectious spondylodiscitis groups were both significantly lower than that of the normal control group (both, P < 0.001).; CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that DWIADC MRI may be useful in the early diagnosis of infectious spondylodiscitis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase-contrast angiographic and diffusion-weighted images obtained I and 2 days after acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke were assessed in 43 patients; 39 underwent perfusion-weighted imaging on day 1. Follow-up phase-contrast angiographic and T2-weighted images (n = 38) were obtained on day 8. Clinical outcome was assessed at 3 months. Patients were assigned to three groups according to angiographic findings on day 1: group 1, absence of flow in proximal MCA (M1 segment); group 2, internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with collateral M1 flow; group 3, flow in ICA and M1. Differences in lesion volumes on diffusion- and perfusion-weighted maps among groups were compared with one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc multiple comparisons.; RESULTS: Patients in group 1 had significantly larger infarct growth, volumes of hypoperfusion on relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow maps, and initial and final infarct volumes than did other patients (P < .05). Initial perfusion deficits on mean transit time maps were significantly (P = .002) larger in group 2 than in group 3, but there were no significant differences in infarct growth (P = .977), final infarct volume on day 8 (P = .947), and clinical outcome (P = .969). Absence of M1 flow on day 1 was significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin score greater than or equal to 3) at 3 months (P = .010, chi(2) test). Discriminant analysis revealed that rCBV maps alone and combination of diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography yielded the highest accuracy in predicting an unfavorable clinical outcome.; CONCLUSION: Phase-contrast MR angiography can provide complementary information to that with diffusion- and perfusion- weighted imaging in predicting the outcome of patients with acute stroke.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: High-definition fiber tracking (HDFT) is a novel combination of processing, reconstruction, and tractography methods that can track white matter fibers from cortex, through complex fiber crossings, to cortical and subcortical targets with subvoxel resolution.
OBJECTIVE: To perform neuroanatomical validation of HDFT and to investigate its neurosurgical applications.; METHODS: Six neurologically healthy adults and 36 patients with brain lesions were studied. Diffusion spectrum imaging data were reconstructed with a Generalized Q-Ball Imaging approach. Fiber dissection studies were performed in 20 human brains, and selected dissection results were compared with tractography.; RESULTS: HDFT provides accurate replication of known neuroanatomical features such as the gyral and sulcal folding patterns, the characteristic shape of the claustrum, the segmentation of the thalamic nuclei, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, the multiple fiber crossing at the centrum semiovale, the complex angulation of the optic radiations, the terminal arborization of the arcuate tract, and the cortical segmentation of the dorsal Broca area. From a clinical perspective, we show that HDFT provides accurate structural connectivity studies in patients with intracerebral lesions, allowing qualitative and quantitative white matter damage assessment, aiding in understanding lesional patterns of white matter structural injury, and facilitating innovative neurosurgical applications. High-grade gliomas produce significant disruption of fibers, and low-grade gliomas cause fiber displacement. Cavernomas cause both displacement and disruption of fibers.; CONCLUSION: Our HDFT approach provides an accurate reconstruction of white matter fiber tracts with unprecedented detail in both the normal and pathological human brain. Further studies to validate the clinical findings are needed.

N2  -  The myelin concentration and the degree of myelination of nerve fibers can provide valuable information on the integrity of human brain tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of myelin-sensitive parameters can help to non-invasively evaluate demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Several different myelin-sensitive MRI methods have been proposed to determine measures of the degree of myelination, in particular the g-ratio. However, variability in underlying physical principles and different biological models influence measured myelin concentrations, and consequently g-ratio values. We therefore investigated similarities and differences between five different myelin-sensitive MRI measures and their effects on g-ratio mapping in the brains of both MS patients and healthy volunteers.We compared two different estimates of the myelin water fraction (MWF) as well as the inhomogeneous mag-netization transfer ratio (ihMTR), magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat), and macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) in 13 patients with MS and 14 healthy controls. In combination with diffusion-weighted imaging, we derived g-ratio parameter maps for each of the five different myelin measures.The g-ratio values calculated from different myelin measures varied strongly, especially in MS lesions. While, compared to normal-appearing white matter, MTsat and one estimate of the MWF resulted in higher g-ratio values within lesions, ihMTR, MTV, and the second MWF estimate resulted in lower lesion g-ratio values.As myelin-sensitive measures provide rough estimates of myelin content rather than absolute myelin con-centrations, resulting g-ratio values strongly depend on the utilized myelin measure and model used for g-ratio mapping. When comparing g-ratio values, it is, thus, important to utilize the same MRI methods and models or to consider methodological differences. Particular caution is necessary in pathological tissue such as MS lesions.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-tensor imaging tractography data into CyberKnife radiosurgery for intracranial tumor management.
Materials and Methods: Functional neuroimaging, anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography images of patients with brain lesions in critical areas were acquired before radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were coregistered using the MIM image fusion software module and then were imported into the CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System (Multiplan 4.0.2) for delineating the target, organs at risk, and possible nearby functionally relevant cortical and subcortical areas. Radiation dose distributions with and without the functionally relevant cortical and subcortical areas into the optimization process were developed and compared.; Results: There were significant differences between the treatment plans with and without the functionally relevant cortical and subcortical areas into the optimization process. An average 22.71% reduction in the maximum dose to functional areas was observed. No neurological complication due to radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period.; Conclusion: The functional neuroimaging could be easily and reliably integrated into the CyberKnife treatment planning. Consideration of functional structures and fiber tracts during treatment planning could clinically reduce the radiation doses to these critical structures, thereby preserving its unique function of brain.

N2  -  We present two cases with diagnoses of cerebral venous thrombosis with extensive pathological changes supporting ischemia on conventional MR imaging (MRI). MR angiography disclosed thrombosis of the vein of Galen and cerebral sinuses. The findings were different on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and on ADC maps. The first case exhibited high signal intensity on DWI and intermediate-to-low signal intensity on ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps in the affected area. This indicated cytotoxic oedema and ischemic lesions. The second case showed intermediate-to-low signal intensity on DWI and high signal intensity on ADC maps. This indicated vasogenic oedema. The severe clinical status of both patients necessitated admittance to the intensive care unit and anticoagulation therapy. In the first case, six months after symptoms onset, signs of organic psychosyndrome, cephalea and vertigo remained. MRI indicated that a residue of the haemorrhage ischemic lesion in the left thalamus persisted, with high signal on T2WI and low signal with mild hypersignal margin on T1WI. In the second case, MR findings and normalization of clinical status after anticoagulation therapy indicated complete remission. We suggest that DWI and ADC contribute to diagnosis and enable a certain degree of prediction of clinical course.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives. Diffusion/perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI/PWI) can provide additional useful information in the diagnosis of patients with brain gliomas in a noninvasive fashion. However, the exact role of these new techniques is still undergoing evaluation. Our hypothesis was that DWI and PWI could be useful for assessment of growth and vascularity of implanted C6 rat gliomas.
Materials and Methods. Thirty-six rats were implanted with C6 glioma cells intracerebrally. Between 1 and 4 weeks after implantation, 8-10 rats were imaged on a clinical, 1.5-T whole-body magnetic resonance system with T-1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T-2-weighted imaging, DWI, PWI, and postcontrast T1WI at each weekly time point. All tumors were examined histologically; tumor cellularity and microvascular density were counted.; Results. On DWIs, statistical differences of apparent diffusion coefficient values for both the tumoral core and peritumoral region were present comparing tumors of 3-4 weeks' growth with tumors of 1-2 weeks' growth. Apparent diffusion coefficient value of tumoral core was negatively correlated with tumor cellularity (r = -0.682, P &LT;.01). Statistical difference of maximal regional cerebral blood volume of tumoral core was present comparing 2-4 weeks with both 1 week after implantation and contralateral white matter (P &LT;.01). Native vessel dilation in regions of normal brain at the periphery of the tumors at 1 week after implantation was observed. Correlation between maximal regional cerebral blood volume of tumor core and microvascular density was present (r = 0.716, P &LT;.01).; Conclusion. DWI and PWI has potential to characterize C6 gliomas in rats, which is a promising model similar to human gliomas. ¬© AUR, 2005.

N2  -  Diffuse axonal injuries (DAI) are found in most traumatic brain injuries (minor, moderate and severe), and are more common than statistic reports show (carried out by clinical studies, not necroptic research). Microscopic studies revealed extended lesions of the brain white matter tracts, particularly under circumstances of brain acceleration/deceleration movement inside the cranium. Clinical symptoms vary with the number of injured axons, from loss of consciousness, brain stem signs and cognitive deficiencies to persistent vegetative states. Imaging diagnosis is more important in DAIS caused by minor and moderate traumatic brain injuries, where false negative images are commonly seen on cranial CT, which is normal or quasi-normal. A cerebral MRI investigation, especially diffusion and gradient-echo sequences, is recommended in these cases. Nevertheless, even 7.9 Tesla high-resolution MRI has its limits, as it only allows viewing of atonal injuries which are large enough to cause signal modification; it does not provided any data on the extent of damage of the functional circuits. The prognostic of diffuse axonal injuries depends on the number of injured axons as well as on the measures taken for functional and structural recovery; a good prognostic indicator might be MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), by drawing color maps (tractographs).

N2  -  Purpose: To determine the feasibility of using combined proton (H-1), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and sodium (Na-23) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor the treatment of uterine leiomyomata (fibroids).
Materials and Methods: Eight patients with uterine leiomyomata were enrolled and treated using MRI-guided high-intensity frequency ultrasound surgery (MRg-HIFUS). MRI scans collected at baseline and posttreatment consisted of T2-, T1-, and H-1 DWI, as well as posttreatment Na-23 MRI. The Na-23 and H-1 MRI were coregistered using a replacement phantom method. Regions of interest in treated and untreated uterine leiomyoma tissue were drawn on H-1 MRI and DWI, wherein the tissue apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC) and absolute sodium concentrations were measured.; Results: Regions of treated uterine tissue were clearly identified on both DWI and Na-23 images. The sodium concentrations in normal myometrium tissue were 35.8 +- 2.1 mmol (mM), in the fundus: 43.4 +- 3.8 mM. and in the bladder; 65.3 +- 0.8 mM with ADC in normal myometrium of 2.2 +- 0.3 x 10(-3)mm(2)see. Sodium concentration in untreated leiomyomata were 28 5 mM, and were significantly elevated (41.6 +- 7.6 mM, P < 0.05) after treatment. Apparent diffusion coefficient values in the treated leiomyomata (1.30 +- 0.38 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec) were decreased compared to areas of untreated leiomyomata (1.75 +- -4048 mu-4050 mu 36 x 10(-3) mm(2)see: P = 0.04).; Conclusion: Multiparametric imaging permits identification of uterine leiomyomata, revealing altered Na-23 MRI and DWI levels following noninvasive treatment that provides a mechanism to explore the molecular and metabolic pathways after treatment.

N2  -  Gliomas are a heterogeneous group that account for similar to 86% of primary brain neoplasms, and include astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumours, as well as a variety of less common histopathological subtypes. Magnetic resonance imaging has become the accepted mode of imaging for the clinical management of these tumours. MRI features bear close resemblance to the histopathology grading and prognosis of these tumours. Currently, conventional MRI is used to aid diagnosis, plan neurosurgical approaches, and monitor response to therapy and disease progression. More recent developments in the field of MRI include MR spectroscopy, perfusion MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, intraoperative MRI and functional MRI. These newer techniques have been adopted with varying success in the management of adult gliomas. This review focuses on the application of advanced MR imaging in the clinical management of adult gliomas.

N2  -  Nineteen patients with acute ischemic stroke (<24 hours) underwent diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted (PWI) magnetic resonance imaging at the acute stage and week later. Eleven patients also underwent technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at the acute stage. Relative (ischemic vs. contralateral control) cerebral blood flow (relCBF), relative cerebral blood volume, and relative mean transit time were measured in the ischemic core, in the area of infarct growth, and in the eventually viable ischemic tissue on PWI maps. The relCBF was also measured from SPECT. There was a curvilinear relationship between the relCBF measured from PWI and SPECT (r = 0.854; P < 0.001). The tissue proceeding to infarction during the follow-up]lad significantly lower initial CBF and cerebral blued volume values on PWI maps (P < 0.001) than the eventually viable ischemic tissue had. The best value for discriminating the area of infarct growth from the eventually viable ischemic tissue was 48% for PWI relCBF and 87% for PWI relative cerebral blood volume. Combined diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging enables one to detect hemodynamically different subregions inside the initial perfusion abnormality. Tissue survival may be different in these subregions and may be predicted.

N2  -  Objectives-To evaluate if patients with acute lacunar syndromes have acute lacunar infarcts or other types of cerebral lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI. Methods-Patients with acute lacunar syndromes underwent echo-planar diffusion MRI of the brain within 3 days after stroke onset. Localization and size of lesions with hyperintense signal were determined, compared with clinical characteristics and with findings on follow-up T2-weighted MRI, Results-Twenty-three patients participated in the study. Thirteen patients had pure motor stroke, 1 pure sensory stroke, 8 sensorimotor stroke, and 1 ataxic hemiparesis. Twenty-two patients had at least one lesion with increased signal on diffusion-weighted NER images. These acute lesions were in the internal capsule/basal ganglia/thalamus in 13 patients, subcortical white matter in 5 patients, brainstem in 2 patients, cortex (multiple small lesions) in 1 patient, and cortex+basal ganglia in 1 patient. The median volume of the lesions was 0.6 mi on the initial examination and on follow-up, of 17 patients after 1 to 5 months, 0.5 mi. Conclusions-Almost all patients with acute ischemic lacunar syndromes have acute lesions on echo-planar diffusion-weighted MRI within 3 days after stroke onset. These lesions are mostly small and subcortical, compatible with lacunar infarcts caused by single penetrating artery occlusion, but in a minor proportion of patients (2 of 23 in our study) a cortical involvement is found.

N2  -  Background and purpose The differential diagnosis between solid glioma and brain inflammation is necessary but sometimes difficult. We assessed the effectiveness of multiple diffusion metrics of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in differentiating solid glioma from brain inflammation and compared the diagnostic performance of different DWI models.Materials and methods Participants diagnosed with either glioma or brain inflammation with a solid lesion on MRI were enrolled in this prospective study from May 2016 to April 2023. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with five b values (500, 1,000, 1,500, 2000, and 2,500 s/mm2) in 30 directions for each b value, and one b value of 0 was included. The mean values of multiple diffusion metrics based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), mean apparent propagator (MAP), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in the abnormal signal area were calculated. Comparisons between glioma and inflammation were performed. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of diffusion metrics were calculated.Results 57 patients (39 patients with glioma and 18 patients with inflammation) were finally included. MAP model, with its metric non-Gaussianity (NG), shows the greatest diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.879) for differentiation of inflammation and glioma with atypical MRI manifestation. The AUC of DKI model, with its metric mean kurtosis (MK) are comparable to NG (AUC = 0.855), followed by NODDI model with intracellular volume fraction (ICVF) (AUC = 0.825). The lowest value was obtained in DTI with mean diffusivity (MD) (AUC = 0.758).Conclusion Multiple diffusion metrics can be used in differentiation of inflammation and solid glioma. Non-Gaussianity (NG) from mean apparent propagator (MAP) model shows the greatest diagnostic performance for differentiation of inflammation and glioma.

N2  -  Purpose Our aim was to investigate the pertinence of diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters obtained at 17.2 T in a 9L glioma rat brain tumor model to evaluate tumor tissue characteristics.
Materials and Methods The local animal ethics advisory committee approved this study. 9L glioma cells were injected intracerebrally to 14 Fischer rats. The animals were imaged at 7 or 12 days after implantation on a 17.2-T MRI scanner, using 72 different b values (2-3025 smm(2)). The signal attenuation, SSo, was fitted using a kurtosis diffusion model (ADCo and K) and a biexponential diffusion model (fractions f(fast) and f(slow) and diffusion coefficients D-fast and D-slow) using b values greater than 300 smm(2). To bridge the 2 models, an average diffusion coefficient <D> and a biexponential index were estimated from the biexponential model as ADCo and K equivalents, respectively. Intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion-related parameters were obtained from the residual signal at low b values, after the diffusion component has been removed. Diffusion and perfusion maps were generated for each fitted parameter on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and regions of interest were drawn in the tumor and contralateral side to retrieve diffusion and perfusion parameters. All rats were killed and cellularity and vascularity were quantitatively assessed using histology for comparison with diffusion and perfusion parameters.; Results Intravoxel incoherent motion maps clearly highlighted tumor areas as generally heterogeneous, as confirmed by histology. For diffusion parameters, ADCo and <D> were not significantly different between the tumor and contralateral side, whereas K in the tumor was significantly higher than in contralateral basal ganglia (P < 0.0001), as well as biexponential index (P < 0.001). ADCo and <D> in the tumor at day 7 were significantly higher than at day 12 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). f(IVIM) in the tumor from the kurtosis diffusion model was significantly higher than in contralateral basal ganglia (P < 0.001). f(IVIM) in the tumor at day 7 was significantly higher than in the tumor at day 12 (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference for D* between the tumor and contralateral side (P = 0.06). A significant negative correlation was found between tumor vascularity and f(IVIM) (P < 0.05) as well as between tumor cell count and <D> (P < 0.01).; Conclusion Quantitative non-Gaussian diffusion and perfusion MRI can provide valuable information on microvasculature and tissue structure to improve characterization of brain tumors.

N2  -  Purpose: To assess any correlation of volume transfer constant (K-trans) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in different brain tumor types at 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with brain tumors (8 men, 5 women; mean age 54.6 +/- 17.7 years) were enrolled in this retrospective study. All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted MR perfusion and diffusion-weighted imaging using a 3 T scanner. K-trans was estimated by specially designed software. For each tumor, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected on corresponding K-trans and ADC maps. Pearson correlation coefficients were obtained for maximum, mean and minimum values of K-trans and ADC of all ROIs. Based on clinicopathologic results, the final diagnoses of patients were glioblastoma multiforme (3), low-grade to anaplastic gliomas (4), meningiomas (3) and metastatic tumors (3). Results: K-trans(max) values were significantly inversely correlated with ADC(min) values (r = -0.536, P < 0.001) and ADC(mean) values (r= -0.465, P < 0.001). K-trans(mean) and K-trans(min) values were significantly inversely correlated with ADC(mean) (r = -0.228, P = 0.038) and ADC(max) values (r = -0.355 , P = 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: We found that irrespective of brain tumor type, there is an inverse correlation between ADC and K-trans. Our findings highlight an intricate relationship between vascular permeability and the tumor microenvironment, probably modulating and/or interacting with changes such as increased cellularity, ischemic insult and varying extracellular matrix composition.

N2  -  Background and objective Contrary to what happens in adult-onset multiple sclerosis (MS), in a previous preliminary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study we showed only subtle normal-appearing brain tissue changes in patients with earlyonset MS. Our objective was to evaluate the presence and extent of tissue damage in the brain normalappearing white matter (NAWM) and gray matter (GM) from a larger population of patients with earlyonset MS. Methods Using diffusion tensor (DT) and magnetization transfer (MT) MR1, we obtained DT and MT ratio (MTR) maps of the NAWM and GM from 23 patients with early-onset MS and 16 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Results Compared with healthy volunteers, patients with early-onset MS had significantly increased average MD (p = 0.02) and FA peak height (p = 0.007) and decreased average FA (p < 0.0001) of the NAWM. Brain dual-echo lesion load was significantly correlated with average FA (r = -0.48, p 0.02) and with FA peak height (r 0.45, p = 0.03) of the NAWM. No MTR and diffusion changes were detected in the GM. Conclusions This study confirms the paucity of the'occult' brain tissue damage in patients with earlyonset MS. It also suggests that in these patients GM is spared by the disease process and that NAWM changes are likely to be secondary to Wallerian degeneration of fibers passing through macroscopic lesions.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  ObjectivesAlthough diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem dissections improved the knowledge of white matter (WM) anatomy, functional information is lacking. Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic resection map of WM.
Experimental designWe studied 130 patients who underwent awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor, spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were co-registered in the MNI space, as well as the resections' areas and residual tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of resection were computed.; Principal observationsThe medial part of dorsal stream (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part indirect anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) subserves speech planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior longitudinal fascicle. Anomias match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF. Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves spatial cognition. Sensori-motor and visual fibers were the most preserved bundles.; ConclusionsWe report the first anatomo-functional atlas of WM connectivity in humans by correlating cognitive data, electrostimulation, and DTI. We provide a valuable tool for cognitive neurosciences and clinical applications. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3117-3136, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Microstructure imaging seeks to noninvasively measure and map microscopic tissue features by pairing mathematical modeling with tailored MRI protocols. This article reviews an emerging paradigm that has the potential to provide a more detailed assessment of tissue microstructure-combined diffusion-relaxometry imaging. Combined diffusion-relaxometry acquisitions vary multiple MR contrast encodings-such as b-value, gradient direction, inversion time, and echo time-in a multidimensional acquisition space. When paired with suitable analysis techniques, this enables quantification of correlations and coupling between multiple MR parameters-such as diffusivity, T-1, T-2, and T-2*. This opens the possibility of disentangling multiple tissue compartments (within voxels) that are indistinguishable with single-contrast scans, enabling a new generation of microstructural maps with improved biological sensitivity and specificity.

N2  -  Objective: To describe the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in a series of severe traumatic brain injuries, their clinical and outcome features, and possible implications.
Design: A descriptive, observational case-series study was carried out.; Patients and interventions: Patients with severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) admitted to the ICU were subjected to MRI study using a 1.5 T scanner. Diffusion-weighted images (DWMR) were obtained using the following echo-planar pulse sequence: TR 10000 ms, TE 126.9 ms, with b values 1000 smm2 in the three spatial dimensions. Combining the three sets of images, an isotropic image conforming a map of the mean ADCs was obtained.; Results: DWMR was performed in 23 patients with severe TBI admitted to the ICU between 2001 and 2004. In the MR images we selected 26 regions of interest (ROIs) where ADC was recorded. We observed a clear increase in diffusion in non-treated space-occupying lesions versus other types of injuries and the normal values. A poorer outcome was recorded in patients with lower ADC values.; Conclusions: Mean ADC in the lesions was greater than the normal values and greater in contusions than in other types of injuries, as an expression of extracellular edema. ADCs were decreased in patients with a poor outcome, suggesting an association between ischemia and the patient prognosis. (c) 2011 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to evaluate parenchymal diffusion properties and metabolite ratios in affected brain tissues of inherited neurometabolic brain diseases with an overview of the current literature about the diagnostic data of both techniques in childhood inherited metabolic brain diseases. The study group was consisting, 19 patients (15 males, 4 females; mean age, 54 months (4.5 years); age range, 1-171 months (14.25 years)) diagnosed with inherited neurometabolic brain disease. Single- and multivoxel proton MRS was carried out and NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, Glx/Cr ratios were calculated. Presence of lactate peak and abnormal different peaks were noted. ADC values were calculated from brain lesions. Results are compared with age and sex matched normal subjects. Elevated NAA/Cr ratio (Canavan disease), galactitol peak (galactosemia) at 3.7 ppm, branched chain amino acids (Maple syrup urine disease-MSUD) at 0.9 ppm were seen on different diseases. In Leigh disease and MSUD restricted diffusion was detected. Different diffusion properties were seen only in one Glutaric aciduria lesions. NAA/Cr ratios and calculated ADC values were significantly different from normal subjects (p<0.05). DWI combined with MRS are complementary methods to routine cranial MRI for evaluating neurometabolic diseases which can give detailed information about neurochemistry of affected brain areas.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-More effective imaging methods are needed to overcome the limitations of CT in the investigation of treatments for acute ischemic stroke. Diffusion-weighted :MRI (DWI) is sensitive in detecting infarcted brain tissue, whereas perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) can detect brain perfusion in the same imaging session. Combining these methods may help in identifying the ischemic penumbra, which is ain important concept in the hemodynamics of acute stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined DWI and PWI in acute (<24 hours) ischemic stroke can predict infarct growth and final size.
Methods-Forty-six patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent DWI and PWI on days 1, 2, and 8. No patient received thrombolysis. Twenty-three patients underwent single-photon emission CT in the acute phase. Lesion volumes were measured from DWI, SPECT, and maps of relative cerebral blood flow calculated from PWI.; Results-The mean volume of infarcted tissue detected by DWI increased from 46.1 to 75.6 cm(3) between days 1 and 2 (P<0.001; n=46) and to 78.5 cm(3) after 1 week (P<0.001; n=42). The perfusion-diffusion mismatch correlated with infarct growth (r=0.699, P<0.001). The volume of hypoperfusion on the initial PWI correlated with final infarct size (r=0.827, P<0.001). The hypoperfusion volumes detected by PWI and SPECT correlated significantly (r=0.824, P<0.001).; Conclusions-Combined DWI and PWI can predict infarct enlargement in acute stroke. PWI can detect hypoperfused brain tissue in good agreement with SPECT in acute stroke.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Different strategies for neuroprotection of neonatal stroke may be required because the developing brain responds differently to hypoxia-ischemia than the mature brain. This study was designed to determine the role of caspase-dependent injury in the pathophysiology of pure focal cerebral ischemia in the immature brain.
Methods-Postnatal day 7 rats were subjected to permanent or transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Diffusion-weighted MRI was used during occlusion to noninvasively map the evolving ischemic core. The time course of caspase-3 activation in ischemic brain tissue was determined with the use of an Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin cleavage assay. The anatomy of caspase-3 activation in the ischemic core and penumbra was mapped immunohistochemically with an anti-activated caspase-3 antibody in coronal sections that matched the imaging planes on diffusion-weighted MRI.; Results-A marked increase in caspase-3 activity occurred within 24 hours of reperfusion after transient MCA occlusion. In contrast, caspase-3 activity remained significantly lower within 24 hours of permanent MCA occlusion. Cells with activated caspase-3 were prominent in the penumbra beginning at 3 hours after reperfusion, while a more delayed but marked caspase-3 activation was observed in the ischemic core by 24 hours after reperfusion.; Conclusions-In the neonate, caspase-3 activation is likely to contribute substantially to cell death not only in the penumbra but also in the core after ischemia with reperfusion. Furthermore, persistent perfusion deficits result in less caspase-3 activation and appear to favor caspase-independent injury.

N2  -  We correlated serial brain MRIs with neuropathological findings in a 16-year-old female whose autopsy was consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion coefficients mapping and neuropathology findings were suggested vasogenic edema in the periaqueductal and peri-the-fourth ventricular areas. This is the first documented case report to make this direct comparison. The characteristic WE changes in the maramillary body was also correlated with the findings of MRI with contrast enhancement. Bilateral cortical lesions revealed by MRI were atypical and rare in WE and were not evidenced by pathological changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Advances in white matter tractography enhance neurosurgical planning and glioma resection, but white matter tractography is limited by biological variables such as edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration or selection biases related to regions of interest or fractional anisotropy values.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an automated tract identification paradigm that corrects for artifacts created by tumor edema and infiltration and provides a consistent, accurate method of fiber bundle identification.; METHODS: An automated tract identification paradigm was developed and evaluated for glioma surgery. A fiber bundle atlas was generated from 6 healthy participants. Fibers of a test set (including 3 healthy participants and 10 patients with brain tumors) were clustered adaptively with this atlas. Reliability of the identified tracts in both groups was assessed by comparison with 2 experts with the Cohen kappa used to quantify concurrence. We evaluated 6 major fiber bundles: cingulum bundle, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the last 3 tracts mediating language function.; RESULTS: The automated paradigm demonstrated a reliable and practical method to identify white mater tracts, despite mass effect, edema, and tract infiltration. When the tumor demonstrated significant mass effect or shift, the automated approach was useful for providing an initialization to guide the expert with identification of the specific tract of interest.; CONCLUSION: We report a reliable paradigm for the automated identification of white matter pathways in patients with gliomas. This approach should enhance the neurosurgical objective of maximal safe resections.

N2  -  Since the seminal works by Brodmann and contemporaries, it is well-known that different brain regions exhibit unique cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic features. Transferring the approach of classifying brain tissues - and other tissues - based on their intrinsic features to the realm of magnetic resonance (MR) is a longstanding endeavor. In the 1990s, atlas-based segmentation replaced earlier multi-spectral classification approaches because of the large overlap between the class distributions. Here, we explored the feasibility of performing global brain classification based on intrinsic MR features, and used several technological advances: ultra-high field MRI, q space trajectory diffusion imaging revealing voxel-intrinsic diffusion properties, chemical exchange saturation transfer and semi-solid magnetization transfer imaging as a marker of myelination and neurochemistry, and current neural network architectures to analyze the data. In particular, we used the raw image data as well to increase the number of input features. We found that a global brain classification of roughly 97 brain regions was feasible with gross classification accuracy of 60%; and that mapping from voxel-intrinsic MR data to the brain region to which the data belongs is possible. This indicates the presence of unique MR signals of different brain regions, similar to their cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic fingerprints.

N2  -  Perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI, dMRI) are valuable diagnostic tools for assessing brain tumors in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of pMRI and dMRI with C-11-methionine positron emission tomography (MET PET) in suspected low-grade gliomas (LGG) prior to surgery. Twenty-four adults with suspected LGG were enrolled in an observational study and examined by MET PET, pMRI and dMRI. Histological tumor diagnosis was confirmed in 23/24 patients (18 gliomas grade II, 5 gliomas grade III). The maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV(max)) and the minimum mean diffusivity (MDmin) were measured in tumor areas with highest MET uptake (hotspot) on PET by using automated co-registration of MRI and PET scans. A clearly defined hotspot on PET was present in all 23 tumors. Regions with rCBV(max) corresponded with hotspot regions in all tumors, regions with MDmin corresponded with hotspot regions in 20/23 tumors. The correlation between rCBV(max) (r = 0.19, P = 0.38) and MDmin (r = -0.41, P = 0.053) with MET uptake in the hotspot was not statistically significant. Taken into account the difficulties of measuring perfusion abnormalities in non-enhancing gliomas, this study demonstrates that co-registered MET PET and pMRI facilitates the identification of regions with rCBV(max). Furthermore, the lack of a clear positive correlation between tumor metabolism in terms of MET uptake and tumor vascularity measured as rCBV(max) suggests that combined pMRI/PET provides complementary baseline imaging data in these tumors.

N2  -  We aimed to establish a rat model of space-occupying hemispheric infarction to evaluate potential treatment strategies. For adequate timing of therapy in future experiments, we studied the development of tissue damage, edema formation, and perfusion over time with different MRI techniques. Permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was performed in 32 Fisher-344 rats. Forty-six MRI experiments including diffusion weighted (DW), T-2-weighted (T2W), flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) perfusion-weighted, and T-1-weighted (T1W) imaging before and after gadolinium were performed at 1, 3, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h of ischemia. MCA occlusion consistently led to infarction of the complete MCA territory. Mortality was 75%. Lesion volumes as derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T, maps increased to rnaximum values of 400 +/- 48 mm(3) at 24 h and 420 +/- 54 mm(3) at 48 h of ischemia, respectively. Midline shift peaked at 24 h. The area with diffusion - perfusion deficit decreased to a minimum at 24 h after onset of ischemia and perfusion of the contralateral hemisphere dropped at the same time point. Leakage of gadolinium through the blood-brain barrier in the entire infarct occurred within 3 h of ischemia. Permanent intraluminal MCA occlusion in Fisher-344 rats is an adequate model for space-occupying cerebral infarction. Rats may benefit from intervention aimed at reducing tissue shift and intracranial pressure (ICP), and at improving cerebral blood flow, if initiated before 24 h after MCA occlusion. The value of treatment modalities depending on an intact blood-brain barrier should be questioned. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system is crucial for an early and reliable diagnosis and monitoring of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Focal white matter (WM) lesions, as detected by MRI, are the pathological hallmark of the disease and show some relation to clinical disability, especially in the long run. Gray matter (GM) involvement is evident from disease onset and includes focal (i.e., cortical lesions) and diffuse pathology (i.e., atrophy). Both accumulate over time and show close relation to physical disability and cognitive impairment. Using advanced quantitative MRI techniques such as magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), proton MR spectroscopy (H-1-MRS), and iron imaging, subtle MS pathology has been demonstrated from early stages outside focal WM lesions in the form of widespread abnormalities of the normal appearing WM and GM. In addition, studies using functional MRI have demonstrated that brain plasticity is driven by MS pathology, playing adaptive or maladaptive roles to neurologic and cognitive status and explaining, at least in part, the clinicoradiological paradox of MS.

N2  -  A newly developed model of transient global ischemia in the rat was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in terms of localization of brain lesions, their extent and severity, and temporal evolution. Such a model, consisting of bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries for 10 minutes and mild hypoxia (15% O-2) for 20 minutes induces delayed neuronal degeneration, necrosis, and gliosis (detected histologically and immunohistochemically). Ischemia was assessed by full suppression of spontaneous electroencephalographic activity. A ''hybrid'' T-2-/diffusion-weighted MR sequence enhancing more effectively the contrast between injured and intact tissues as compared to T-2-weighted MRI was used at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours and at 7 days postischemia. Twenty hypoxic-ischemic rats showed a considerable variability in brain damage. In 8, there were no MRI-detectable lesions at any interval. In the other 12 rats, the severity and extension of neuronal damage varied markedly, but the lesions were always localized (monolaterally in 8 and bilaterally in 4 rats) in the occipital, temporal, or parietal cerebral cortex. Mainly, they were of intermediate severity or were severe (as assessed by MRI hyperintensity) and were accompanied by usually less severe lesions in the thalamus and/or caudate putamen. The hippocampus was affected moderately or severely in 4 of 12 rats. In most cases, there was at 48 hours a considerable growth in severity and/or extension of lesions, which usually remained stable at later intervals. In conclusion, MRI allowed us to follow brain lesions during the first week in this relatively simple and noninvasive model of transient global ischemia.

N2  -  Purpose: Medulloblastoma (MB) is a high-grade rare brain tumor in adults, with heterogeneous imaging features and variable enhancing patterns. Diffusion and spectroscopy multimodal imaging have already been described in adult MB, yet perfusion has not been explored. This study aimed to evaluate vascularity in adult classic and desmoplastic MB, using perfusion-weighted dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and histopathology.
Methods: Six histologically proved MB patients were classified as classic (n=3) and desmoplastic (n=3). DSC perfusion MRI was performed in three centers and retrospectively evaluated. Postprocessing included automatic arterial input function, motion and contrast leakage correction. Region of interest (ROI) delineation was performed on three perfusion slices to obtain a total of three cerebral blood volume ratios (rCBV) that were averaged to serve as the main rCBV. Permeability was evaluated on K2 maps.; Results: Low rCBVs were observed in all cases (mean rCBV = 1.19 +- 0.39). rCBV values were lower than 2 for classic MB and lower than 1 for desmoplastic MB. All cases showed an increase of permeability on K2 maps.; Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that MB exhibits rCBV values close to 1 and increased permeability on DSC perfusion imaging, especially in desmoplastic cases, which could be explained by fibrous matrix. This type of perfusion pattern contrasts with those given by other enhancing subtentorial tumors such as metastasis, high-grade gliomas or hemangioblastomas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  -  Accurate anatomical localisation of specific white matter tracts and the quantification of their tract-specific microstructural damage in conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) can contribute to a better understanding of symptomatology, disease evolution and intervention effects. Diffusion MRI-based tractography is being used increasingly to segment white matter tracts as regions-of-interest for subsequent quantitative analysis. Since MS lesions can interrupt the tractography algorithm's tract reconstruction, clinical studies frequently resort to atlas-based approaches, which are convenient but ignorant to individual variability in tract size and shape. Here, we revisit the problem of individual tractography in MS, comparing tractography algorithms using: (i) The diffusion tensor framework; (ii) constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD); and (iii) damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) deconvolution. Firstly, using simulated and in vivo data from 29 MS patients and 19 healthy controls, we show that the three tracking algorithms respond differentially to MS pathology. While the tensor-based approach is unable to deal with crossing fibres, CSD produces spurious streamlines, in particular in tissue with high fibre loss and low diffusion anisotropy. With dRL, streamlines are increasingly interrupted in pathological tissue. Secondly, we demonstrate that despite the effects of lesions on the fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms, fibre tracking algorithms are still able to segment tracts that pass through areas with a high prevalence of lesions. Combining dRL-based tractography with an automated tract segmentation tool on data from 131 MS patients, the corticospinal tracts and arcuate fasciculi could be reconstructed in more than 90% of individuals. Comparing tract-specific microstructural parameters (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and magnetisation transfer ratio) in individually segmented tracts to those from a tract probability map, we show that there is no systematic disease-related bias in the individually reconstructed tracts, suggesting that lesions and otherwise damaged parts are not systematically omitted during tractography. Thirdly, we demonstrate modest anatomical correspondence between the individual and tract probability-based approach, with a spatial overlap between 35 and 55%. Correlations between tract-averaged microstructural parameters in individually segmented tracts and the probability-map approach ranged between r = .53 (p < .001) for radial diffusivity in the right cortico-spinal tract and r = .97 (p < .001) for magnetisation transfer ratio in the arcuate fasciculi. Our results show that MS white matter lesions impact fibre orientation reconstructions but this does not appear to hinder the ability to anatomically reconstruct white matter tracts in MS. Individual tract segmentation in MS is feasible on a large scale and could prove a powerful tool for investigating diagnostic and prognostic markers.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo determine whether lesion to activation distance (LAD) on presurgical blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and degree of white matter involvement by primary or metastatic brain lesions predict perioperative motor and language deficits.
METHODSWe retrospectively evaluated 76 patients with intra-axial brain lesions referred for presurgical fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We measured expressive, receptive, global language and motor LAD and assessed degree of involvement of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). We performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine whether the LAD and the degree of CSTSLF involvement were statistically significantly different between patients with and without preoperative or postoperative neurological deficits.; RESULTSIn preoperatively symptomatic patients, motor and expressive language LAD were significantly lower (z = -3.78, P = .0002, and z = -2.51, P = .01, respectively) than in asymptomatic patients. No significant difference was noted in LAD between postoperative symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, except for a trend level effect for motor LAD (P = .07). The degree of CST involvement was significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 3.40, P = .0007 and z = 2.97, P = .003, respectively, for pre- and postoperative motor deficits).The degree of SLF involvement was significantly different between preoperatively (but not postoperatively) symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (z = 2.85, P = .004).; CONCLUSIONPresurgical motor and expressive language LAD as well as degree of tract involvement on DTI are predictive of preoperative but not postoperative deficits, except for CST DTI and (trend level) motor LAD; inability of language LAD to predict postoperative deficits suggests that preoperative fMRI is valuable to neurosurgeons in avoiding resection of eloquent cortex.

N2  -  Aim of the study: Prognosticationmaybe difficult in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially useful in the prediction of neurological outcome, and it may detect acute ischemia at an early stage. In a pilot setting we determined the prevalence and development of cerebral ischemia using serial MRI examinations and neurological assessment.
Methods: Ten witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were included. MRI was carried out approximately 2 h after admission to the hospital, repeated after 24 h of therapeutic hypothermia and 96 h after the arrest. The images were assessed for development of acute ischemic lesions. Neurophysiological and cognitive tests as well as a self-reported quality-of-life questionnaire, Short Form-36 (SF-36), were administered minimum 12 months after discharge.; Results: None of the patients had acute cerebral ischemia on MRI at admission. Three patients developed ischemic lesions after therapeutic hypothermia. There was a change in the apparent diffusion coefficient, which significantly correlated with the temperature (p < 0.001). The neurophysiological tests appeared normal. The patients scored significantly better on SF 36 than the controls as regards both bodily pain (p = 0.023) and mental health (p = 0.016).; Conclusions: MRI performed in an early phase after cardiac arrest has limitations, as MRI performed after 24 and 96 h revealed ischemic lesions not detectable on admission. ADC was related to the core temperature, and not to the volume distributed intravenously. Follow-up neurophysiologic tests and self-reported quality of life were good. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Distinct injuries to various limbic white matter pathways have been reported to be associated with different aspects of cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers a noninvasive method to map tissue microstructural organization. We utilized quantitative magnetic resonance imaging methods to analyze the main limbic system-white matter structures in MS patients with cognitive impairment (CI).
METHODS: Ten cognitively nonimpaired MS (MSNI) patients and 36 patients with diagnosed CI (MSCI) underwent the minimal assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS) battery. DTI measures of fornix, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus (UF) included tract volume and corresponding fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (AD) diffusivities. These were statistically analyzed for associations with CI after adjusting for the confounders.; RESULTS: Fornix FA and RD, left cingulum FA, MD, and RD, right cingulum FA, MD, and RD, and left UF FA showed significant differences between MSNI and MSCI (P < .001). Fornix FA (r = -.6) and RD (r = .52), and right cingulum FA (r = -.54) and RD (r = .5) correlated significantly with CI in regression analyses.; CONCLUSIONS: The extent of disruption of microstructural disorganization in the main limbic pathways using DTI impacts the extent of CI seen in subjects with MS.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To compare acute measurements of flow heterogeneity (FH) and mean transit time (MTT) with follow-up,data to determine which method yields better predictive measures,of final infarct volumes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:. Twenty-three patients with symptoms of stroke underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging during the acute stage, and the tissue at risk was estimated from MTT, maps and maps generated by means of detecting abnormal FH. Final infarct volumes were calculated from T2-weighted follow-up MR image measurement. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the two predictive maps (MTT and FH) with T2-weighted follow-up maps.; RESULTS: Eleven (48%) patients experienced infarct growth. Both the MTT and the FH maps enabled prediction, of 10 of these cases. There were five false-positive cases with, MTT measurement but three with FH measurement. In terms of predicting final infarct volumes, the final infarct size on the MTT maps was overestimated by 75%. The final infarct size on the FH maps also was overestimated, but by only 15%. MTT map measurements were significantly different from follow-up MR image measurements (P = .005), but FH map measurements were not (P = .059).; CONCLUSION: FH maps may enable,more precise prediction of final infarct volume in stroke patients.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) aims to disentangle multiple biological signal sources in each imaging voxel, enabling the computation of innovative maps of tissue microstructure. DW-MRI model development has been dominated by brain applications. More recently, advanced methods with high fidelity to histology are gaining momentum in other contexts, for example, in oncological applications of body imaging, where new biomarkers are urgently needed. The objective of this article is to review the state-of-the-art of DW-MRI in body imaging (ie, not including the nervous system) in oncology, and to analyze its value as compared to reference colocalized histology measurements, given that demonstrating the histological validity of any new DW-MRI method is essential. In this article, we review the current landscape of DW-MRI techniques that extend standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), describing their acquisition protocols, signal models, fitting settings, microstructural parameters, and relationship with histology. Preclinical, clinical, and in/ex vivo studies were included. The most used techniques were intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM; 36.3% of used techniques), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI; 16.7%), vascular, extracellular, and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumors (VERDICT; 13.3%), and imaging microstructural parameters using limited spectrally edited diffusion (IMPULSED; 11.7%). Another notable category of techniques relates to innovative b-tensor diffusion encoding or joint diffusion-relaxometry. The reviewed approaches provide histologically meaningful indices of cancer microstructure (eg, vascularization/cellularity) which, while not necessarily accurate numerically, may still provide useful sensitivity to microscopic pathological processes. Future work of the community should focus on improving the inter-/intra-scanner robustness, and on assessing histological validity in broader contexts.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI tractography is increasingly used in pre-operative neurosurgical planning to visualize critical fiber tracts. However, a major challenge for conventional tractography, especially in patients with brain tumors, is tracing fiber tracts that are affected by vasogenic edema, which increases water content in the tissue and lowers diffusion anisotropy. One strategy for improving fiber tracking is to use a tractography method that is more sensitive than the traditional single-tensor streamline tractography.
We performed experiments to assess the performance of two-tensor unscented Kalman filter (UKF) tractography in edema. UKF tractography fits a diffusion model to the data during fiber tracking, taking advantage of prior information from the previous step along the fiber. We studied UKF performance in a synthetic diffusion MRI digital phantom with simulated edema and in retrospective data from two neurosurgical patients with edema affecting the arcuate fasciculus and corticospinal tracts. We compared the performance of several tractography methods including traditional streamline, UKF single-tensor, and UKF two-tensor. To provide practical guidance on how the UKF method could be employed, we evaluated the impact of using various seed regions both inside and outside the edematous regions, as well as the impact of parameter settings on the tractography sensitivity. We quantified the sensitivity of different methods by measuring the percentage of the patient-specific fMRI activation that was reached by the tractography.; We expected that diffusion anisotropy threshold parameters, as well as the inclusion of a free water model, would significantly influence the reconstruction of edematous WM fiber tracts, because edema increases water content in the tissue and lowers anisotropy. Contrary to our initial expectations, varying the fractional anisotropy threshold and including a free water model did not affect the UKF two-tensor tractography output appreciably in these two patient datasets. The most effective parameter for increasing tracking sensitivity was the generalized anisotropy (GA) threshold, which increased the length of tracked fibers when reduced to 0.075. In addition, the most effective seeding strategy was seeding in the whole brain or in a large region outside of the edema.; Overall, the main contribution of this study is to provide insight into how UKF tractography can work, using a two-tensor model, to begin to address the challenge of fiber tract reconstruction in edematous regions near brain tumors.

We aim to test the effect of a denoising algorithm based on a Deep Learning Reconstruction (DLR) technique on quantitative MRI parameters while reducing scan time. In 22 consecutive patients with brain tumors, DLR applied to fast and noisy MR sequences preserves the mean values of quantitative parameters (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, T1 and T2 -relaxation time) and produces maps with higher structural similarity compared to long duration sequences. This could promote wider use of these biomarkers in clinical setting. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  -  Purpose: The median survival for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common type of brain tumor, is less than 1 year. Animal glioma models that are more predictive of therapeutic response in human patients than traditional models and that are genetically and histologically accurate are an unmet need. The nestin tv-a (Ntv-a) genetically engineered mouse spontaneously develops glioma when infected with ALV-A expressing platelet-derived growth factor, resulting in autocrine platelet-derived growth factor signaling.
Experimental Design: In the Ntv-a genetically engineered mouse model, T2-weighted and T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images were correlated with histology, glioma grade (high or low), and survival. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was therefore used to enroll mice with high-grade gliomas into a second study that tested efficacy of the current standard of care for glioma, temozolomide (100 mgkg qdx5 i.p., n = 13).; Results: The Ntv-a model generated a heterogeneous group of gliomas, some with high-grade growth rate and histologic characteristics and others with characteristics of lower-grade gliomas. We showed that MRI could be used to predict tumor grade and survival. Temozolomide treatment of high-grade tv-a gliomas provided a 14-day growth delay compared with vehicle controls. Diffusion MRI measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient showed an early decrease in cellularity with temozolomide, similar to that observed in humans.; Conclusions: The use of MRI in the Ntv-a model allows determination of glioma grade and survival prediction, distribution of mice with specific tumor types into preclinical trials, and efficacy determination both by tumor growth and early apparent diffusion coefficient response.

N2  -  Background: High-grade gliomas (HGGs) and brain metastases (BMs) can display similar imaging characteristics on conventional MRI. In HGGs, the peritumoral edema may be infiltrated by the malignant cells, which was not observed in BMs.
Purpose: To determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient values could differentiate HGGs from BMs.; Material and Methods: Fifty-seven patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before treatment. The minimum and mean ADC in the enhancing tumor (ADC(min), ADC(mean)) and the minimum ADC in the peritumoral region (ADC(edema)) were measured from ADC maps. To determine whether there was a statistical difference between groups, ADC values were compared. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff ADC value for distinguishing between HGGs and BMs.; Results: The mean ADC(min) values in the intratumoral regions of HGGs were significantly higher than those in BMs. No differences were observed between groups regarding ADC(mean) values. The mean ADC(min) values in the peritumoral edema of HGGs were significantly lower than those in BMs. According to ROC curve analysis, a cutoff value of 1.332x10(-3) mm(2)s for the ADC(edema) generated the best combination of sensitivity (95%) and specificity (84%) for distinguishing between HGGs and BMs. The same value showed a sensitivity of 95.6% and a specificity of 100% for distinguishing between GBMs and BMs.; Conclusion: ADC values from DWI were found to distinguish between HGGs and solitary BMs. The peritumoral ADC values are better than the intratumoral ADC values in predicting the tumor type.

N2  -  Noninvasive differential diagnosis of brain tumors is currently based on the assessment of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coupled with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC). However, a definitive diagnosis often requires neurosurgical interventions that compromise patients' quality of life. We apply deep learning on DSC images from histology-confirmed patients with glioblastoma, metastasis, or lymphoma. The convolutional neural network trained on similar to 50,000 voxels from 40 patients provides intratumor probability maps that yield clinical-grade diagnosis. Performance is tested in 400 additional cases and an external validation cohort of 128 patients. The tool reaches a three-way accuracy of 0.78, superior to the conventional MRI metrics cerebral blood volume (0.55) and percentage of signal recovery (0.59), showing high value as a support diagnostic tool. Our open-access software, Diagnosis In Susceptibility Contrast Enhancing Regions for Neurooncology (DISCERN), demonstrates its potential in aiding medical decisions for brain tumor diagnosis using standard-of-care MRI.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives. Treatment of brain neoplasms can greatly benefit from better delineation of bulk neoplasm boundary and the extent and degree of more subtle neoplastic infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality for evaluation before and after therapy, typically combining conventional sequences with more advanced techniques such as perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The purpose of this study is to quantify the multiparametric imaging profile of neoplasms by integrating structural MRI and DTI via statistical image analysis methods to potentially capture complex and subtle tissue characteristics that are not obvious from any individual image or parameter.
Materials and Methods. Five structural MRI sequences, namely, B0, diffusion-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, TI-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted, and two scalar maps computed from DTI (ie, fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) are used to create an intensity-based tissue profile. This is incorporated into a nonlinear pattern classification technique to create a multiparametric probabilistic tissue characterization,. which is applied to data from 14 patients with newly diagnosed primary high-grade neoplasms who have not received any therapy before imaging.; Results. Preliminary results demonstrate that this multiparametric tissue characterization helps to better differentiate among neoplasm, edema, and healthy tissue, and to identify tissue that is likely to progress to neoplasm in the future. This has been validated on expert assessed tissue.; Conclusion. This approach has potential applications in treatment, aiding computer-assisted surgery by determining the spatial distributions of healthy and neoplastic tissue, as well as in identifying tissue that is relatively more prone to tumor recurrence.

N2  -  Background. Usefulness and ability of diffusion and perfusion weighted magnetic resonance images (DWI and PWI) to detect intracerebral haemodynamic disturbance have not been fully evaluated.
Methods. After the right common carotid artery had been ligated, rats were exsanguinated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 35, 42, or 50 mm Hg (n=6, each group). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated from DWIs and lesion volume (area) was defined based on ADC values (ADC lesion volume (area)).; Results. ADC lesion volume during exsanguination in the 35 mm Hg group (417 (111) mm(3), P<0.01) was significantly larger than in the 42 mm Hg group (87 (84) mm(3)) and 50 mm Hg group (42 (58) mm 3). The low relative cerebral blood flow area, calculated from PWI, was significantly larger during exsanguination in the 35 mm Hg group than in the other groups. ADC lesion volume in the six rats that died within 3 days of the MRI study was significantly larger (median 421 mm(3), range 205-476 mm(3), P<0.005) than in the 12 rats that survived for 3 days (median 26 mm(3), range 3-517 mm(3)). Rats with an ADC lesion area over 14 mm(2) on the coronal slice including the caudate putamen during exsanguination died within 3 days or revealed a more severe histopathological outcome than those that survived for 3 days.; Conclusions. Incomplete cerebral ischaemia created by the combination of common carotid artery occlusion and exsanguination could be detected by DWI and PWI both qualitatively and quantitatively. The size of the lesion on ADC mapping was found to correlate with mortality and outcome.

N2  -  Background: Early detection of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in the asphyxic newborn is important because present prognostic factors are inadequate. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions may have additional benefit if initiated in time.
Purpose: To assess whether the use of a combined protocol including conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) could detect pathological findings in a piglet model 7 hours after HI.; Material and Methods: Ten piglets were submitted to HI for 30 min followed by reoxygenation with 21% O2 for 7 hours. MRI at 1.5T was done prior to and 7 hours after the HI. Single-voxel proton MRS was performed, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in the basal ganglia. MRS identified N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac). Histology and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) staining was performed in the basal ganglia at the end of the experiment.; Results: Compared to baseline, ADC, NAACho, and NAACr were significantly reduced after 7 hours (P0.001, P=0.01, and P=0.05, respectively) and FA values were increased (P0.025). The ratios of LacCho and LacNAA were significantly higher after 7 hours compared to baseline (P0.001). Presence of necrosis correlated well with reduced ADC (RS=0.91) and presence of Lac (RS=0.80). Histology and MAP-2 staining showed more than 90% necrosis in eight piglets, 60% in one piglet, and no necrosis in one piglet.; Conclusion: Diffusion MRI and proton MRS can detect HI injury in the piglet brain 7 hours after hypoxia. DWI and MRS can be used to give useful prognostic information. This piglet model may potentially be used to mimic clinical situations and is suitable for further research investigating HI injury.

N2  -  Purpose: Performance of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules. Method: In a retrospective study with malignant nodules of 14 patients, H-MRS and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) were performed. Choline (Cho) peak, Cho/creatine (Cr) ratio, and ADC values of malignant nodules were correlated with the five benign nodules and four normal-appearing thyroid lobe parenchymata. The gold standard reference was fine needle aspiration biopsy and histopathology. Results: At echo time 40-144-ms acquisitions, average Cho/Cr ratio for the malignant nodules was 2.95 +/- 1.54-5.30 +/- 2.38, cutoff values were >0.805 and >1.225, and ADC values were 0.06 +/- 0.02. Conclusion: H-MRS acquisitions, DWI, and ADC mapping give diagnostic data about the nature of the nodules. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) of the pleura are rare soft-tissue tumors that are presumed to be of mesenchymal origin. Most SFTs are histologically benign, but up to 20% of SFTs may be malignant. In addition, malignant transformation may occur within histologically benign SFTs, though it is rare. However, it is difficult to diagnose malignant SFTs of the pleura by means of conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article we present the first case of malignant SFT of the pleura in an 81-year-old man in which the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and ADC map based on diffusion-weighted MRI were very useful for identifying malignant transformation.

N2  -  To facilitate the development of new brain metastasis (BM) treatment, an easy-to-use and clinically relevant animal model with imaging platform is needed. Rhabdomyosarcoma BM was induced in WAG/Rij rats. Post-implantation surveillance and characterizations were systematically performed with multiparametric MRI including 3D T1 and T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T1 and T2 mapping, and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), which were validated by postmortem digital radiography (DR), mu CT angiography and histopathology. The translational potential was exemplified by the application of a vascular disrupting agent (VDA). BM was successfully induced in most rats of both genders (18/20). Multiparametric MRI revealed significantly higher T2 value, pre-contrast-enhanced (preCE) T1 value, DWI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and CE ratio, but a lower post-contrast-enhanced (postCE) T1 value in BM lesions than in adjacent brain (p < 0.01). PWI showed the dynamic and higher contrast agent uptake in the BM compared with the adjacent brain. DR, mu CT and histopathology characterized the BM as hypervascular tumors. After VDA treatment, the BM showed drug-related perfusion changes and partial necrosis as evidenced by anatomical, functional MRI parameters and postmortem findings. The present BM model and imaging modalities represent a feasible and translational platform for developing BM-targeting therapeutics.

N2  -  Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody with activity against recurrent malignant glioma inducing high rates of objective responses as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the mechanisms of the anti-tumor action of bevacizumab are controversial. In particular, it is unclear whether and when bevacizumab induces hypoxia in gliomas. Vascular normalization with hyperperfusion and enhanced oxygen delivery to the tumor has been suggested as an alternative mechanism. We analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in 18 consecutive patients with recurrent malignant glioma before and after exposure to bevacizumab. Stroke-like lesions with diffusion restriction on DWI and corresponding ADC decrease were induced by bevacizumab within the previously enhancing tumor area in 13 of 18 patients. These lesions were detectable as early as 4 weeks after initiation of therapy and were maintained for up to 80 weeks. In one patient, an ADC-decreased lesion was biopsied, and histology showed atypical necrosis and nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha upregulation but no tumor recurrence. Normalized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were analyzed in selected patients. Both parameters were decreased in responders with diffusion-restricted lesions. Within the tumor bed, bevacizumab induces diffusion-restricted lesions in the presence of reduced rCBF and rCBV. The cause of these alterations is unclear but may involve atypical necrosis and chronic hypoxia.

N2  -  Two young patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) of the brain stem are described. In spite of similar lesion sites in the brain stem, reaching from the upper medulla to the mesencephalon, the outcomes of the patients were very different: one made a full clinical recovery within three weeks while the other remained in a locked-in state more than a year after the disease episode. Both patients also differed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings on admission. The patient who remained in a locked-in state had pathological diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) scans and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient maps initially, with severe tissue destruction on follow up computed tomography, while the patient who recovered fully showed initially increased apparent diffusion coefficient values and almost complete resolution of MRI changes on follow up. Thus a comparison of these two cases may indicate differences in the underlying pathology in ADEM (vasogenic v cytotoxic oedema) that may be crucial for estimating tissue damage and clinical outcome.

N2  -  Selective neuronal death of the hippocampal CAI area after mild ischemia is known as delayed neuronal death (DND). Progression of DND was evaluated using 7 T MRI in gerbils. in the CAI, the T2 relaxation time started to increase on day 3 and was significantly higher on day 4 than that of the control gerbils. However, the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC) was significantly lower on day I than in the control and continued to decline up to day 4. Changes in T2 coincided with loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity, while the ADC decrease preceded these changes. After I month, the ADC had returned to within the normal range, while T2 had decreased to below the control level. These results suggest that MRI is useful for monitoring DND.

N2  -  In this article, we review the clinical applications of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the radiotherapy treatment of several key clinical sites, including those of the central nervous system, the head and neck, the prostate, and the cervix. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is an imaging technique that is rapidly gaining widespread acceptance owing to its ease and wide availability. DWI measures the mobility of water within tissue at the cellular level without the need of any exogenous contrast agent. For radiotherapy treatment planning, DWI improves upon conventional imaging techniques, by better characterization of tumor tissue properties required for tumor grading, diagnosis, and target volume delineation. Because DWI is also a sensitive marker for alterations in tumor cellularity, it has potential clinical applications in the early assessment of treatment response following radiation therapy.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based fiber tracking is a noninvasive magnetic resonance technique that can delineate the course of white matter fibers.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of this DT imaging-based fiber tracking for surgery in patients with gliomas near the pyramidal tract (PT).; METHODS: Subjects comprised 32 patients with gliomas near the PT. DT imaging-based fiber tracks of the PT were generated before and within 3 days after surgery in all patients. A tractography-integrated navigation system was used during the operation. Cortical and subcortical motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were also monitored during resection to maximize the preservation of motor function. The threshold intensity for subcortical MEPs was examined by searching the stimulus points and changing the stimulus intensity. Minimum distance between the resection border and the illustrated PT was measured on postoperative tractography.; RESULTS: In all subjects, DT imaging-based tractography of the PT was successfully performed, preoperatively demonstrating the relationship between tumors and the PT. With the use of the tractography-integrated navigation system and intraoperative MEPs, motor function was preserved postoperatively in all patients. A significant correlation was seen between threshold intensity for subcortical MEPs and the distance between the resection border and PT on postoperative DT imaging.; CONCLUSION: DT imaging-based fiber tracking is a reliable and accurate method for mapping the course of subcortical PTs. Fiber tracking and intraoperative MEPs were useful for preserving motor function in patients with gliomas near the PT.

N2  -  This study investigates the development of a small focal cortical lesion produced in a model of brain injury. Two approaches were chosen: diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and histology. DW images were collected before devascularization and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after treatment. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated from the DW images to quantify lesion development. As a second measure of injury, tissue morphology was analyzed using cresyl violet histochemistry. A significant reduction in ADC values within the cortex below the injury site by 0.5 days after surgery was observed. Between 5 and 14 days the ADC values recovered to control levels. ADC changes were also observed in the contralateral cortex at 0.5, 1 and 5 days. The decrease in ADC observed at the early time points suggested cytotoxic edema, whereas the recovery to control levels at later time points suggested infarct formation. This model of brain injury resulted in progressive but relatively slow formation of a pan-necrotic infarct within 14 days. In particular, substantial amounts of cell death were not observed until 2 days after surgery.. Overall, the quantitative and histological measures of this lesion are consistent with those observed for an ischemic type of injury, however, the time course of these lesions' development are consistent with other models of traumatic brain injury. Our data demonstrates that DWI is a highly sensitive metric for ischemic-type damage that results from brain injury. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BY. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Accurate localization of anatomically and functionally separate SMA tracts is important to improve planning prior to neurosurgery. Using fMRI and probabilistic DTI techniques, we assessed the connectivity between the frontal language area (Broca's area) and the rostral pre-SMA (language SMA) and caudal SMA proper (motor SMA).
Materials and methods: Twenty brain tumor patients completed motor and language fMRI paradigms and DTI. Peaks of functional activity in the language SMA, motor SMA and Broca's area were used to define seed regions for probabilistic tractography.; Results: fMRI and probabilistic tractography identified separate and unique pathways connecting the SMA to Broca's area the language SMA pathway and the motor SMA pathway. For all subjects, the language SMA pathway had a larger number of voxels (P < 0.0001) and higher connectivity (P < 0.0001) to Broca's area than did the motor SMA pathway. In each patient, the number of voxels was greater in the language and motor SMA pathways than in background pathways (P < 0.0001). No differences were found between patients with ipsilateral and those with contralateral tumors for either the language SMA pathway (degree of connectivity: P < 0.36; number of voxels: 0.35) or the motor SMA pathway (degree of connectivity, P < 0.28; number of voxels, P < 0.74).; Conclusion: Probabilistic tractography can identify unique white matter tracts that connect Language SMA and motor SMA to Broca's area. The language SMA is more significantly connected to Broca's area than is the motor subdivision of the SMA proper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose To evaluate perfusion, diffusion, and spectroscopy values in enhancing and non-enhancing lesions for patients with newly diagnosed gliomas of different grades.
Materials and Methods Sixty-seven patients with newly diagnosed glioma were entered into the study 20 grade II, 26 grade III and 21 grade IV. MR data were acquired at 1.5T and included diffusion weighted images (5967 patients), dynamic perfusion weighted images (3067 patients) and 3D H-1 MR spectroscopy (6467 patients). Enhancing and non-enhancing lesions were delineated by a neuroradiologist and applied to maps of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), relative anisotropy (RA) and metabolite intensities.; Results The median rCBV within enhancing regions of grade IV gliomas was significantly elevated relative to enhancing regions in grade III gliomas and normal brain. ADC was elevated relative to normal brain, but was not significantly different between grades or between enhancing and non-enhancing regions. The RA was higher in the non-enhancing region of grade IV gliomas relative to grade II and grade III. Levels of lactate plus lipid were significantly elevated in grade IV relative to grade II and grade III gliomas. Both enhancing and non-enhancing regions in grade IV gliomas showed significant correlations between CBV, ADC and choline levels.; Conclusion The data were consistent with grade IV gliomas having higher membrane turnover, increased cell density and increased vascularity within enhancing lesions. Analysis of the correlations among parameters within grade IV gliomas suggested that high vascularity (high rCBV) was correlated with increased cellularity (low ADC) and increased membrane turnover (high choline) in these lesions. The non-enhancing region of grades 11 and III gliomas had MR parameters consistent with increased cellularity andor membrane turnover. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: For quick and stable identification of the primary motor area (PMA), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired and corticospinal tractography was mathematically visualized.
METHODS: Data sets of DTI, anatomic magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging with finger-tapping tasks were acquired during the same investigation in 30 patients with a brain lesion affecting the motor system. Off-line processing of DTI data was performed to visualize the corticospinal tract, placing a seed area in the cerebral pecluncle of the midbrain, where the corticospinal tract is densely concentrated. Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields and intraoperative cortical somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded with electrical stimulation of the median nerve to confirm the results of the corticospinal tractography.; RESULTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and somatosensory evoked magnetic fields failed to identify the PMA in eight patients (16.7%) and one patient (3.8%) investigated, respectively, because of cortical dysfunctions caused by brain lesions. DTI data were acquired within 3 minutes without patient tasks. Using the appropriate seed area and fractional anisotropy, corticospinal tractography successfully indicated the PMA location in all patients. The suspected PMA and central sulcus locations were confirmed by the cortical somatosensory evoked potentials.; CONCLUSION: Corticospinal tractography enables identification of the PMA and is beneficial, particularly for patients who present with dysfunction of the PMA.

N2  -  The most common malignant primary brain tumor, glioblastorna multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease with a grim prognosis. Patient survival is typically less than two years and fewer than 10% of patients survive more than five years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can have great utility in the diagmosis, grading, and management of patients with GBM as many of the physical manifestations of the pathologic processes in GBM can be visualized and quantified using MRI. Newer MRI techniques such as dynamic contrast enhanced and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI provide functional information about the tumor hemodynarnic status. Diffusion MRI can shed light on tumor cellularity and the disruption of white matter tracts in the proximity of tumors. MR spectroscopy can be used to study new tumor tissue markers such as IDII mutations. MRI is helping to noninvasively explore the link between the molecular basis of gliornas and the imaging characteristics of their physical processes. We, here, review several approaches to MR-based imaging and discuss the potential for these techniques to quantify the physical processes in glioblas Loma, including tumor cellularity and vascularity, metabolite expression, and pat terns of tumor growth and recurrence. We conclude with challenges and opportunities for further research in applying physical principles to better understand the biologic process in this deadly disease. (C) 2014 AACR,

N2  -  Background and purpose: The excess fluid as a result of vasogenic oedema and the subsequent tissue cavitation obscure the microstructural characterisation of ischaemic tissue by conventional diffusion and relaxometry MRI. They lead to a pseudo-normalisation of the water diffusivity and transverse relaxation time maps in the subacute and chronic phases of stroke. Within the context of diffusion MRI, the free water elimination and mapping method (FWE) with echo time dependence has been proposed as a promising approach to measure the amount of free fluid in brain tissue robustly and to eliminate its biasing effect on other biomarkers. In this longitudinal study of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in the rat brain, we investigated the use of FWE MRI with echo time dependence for the characterisation of the tissue microstructure and explored the potential of the free water fraction as a novel biomarker of ischaemic tissue condition. Methods: Adult rats received a transient MCAo. Diffusion-and transverse relaxation-weighted MRI experiments were performed longitudinally, pre-occlusion and on days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 after MCAo on four rats. Histology was performed for non-stroke and 1, 3 and 10 days after MCAo on three different rats at each time point. Results: The free water fraction was homogeneously increased in the ischaemic cortex one day after stroke. Between three and ten days after stroke, the core of the ischaemic tissue showed a progressive normalisation in the amount of free water, whereas the inner and outer border zones of the ischaemic cortex depicted a large, monotonous increase with time. The specific lesions in brain sections were verified by H&E and immunostaining. The tissue-specific diffusion and relaxometry MRI metrics in the ischaemic cortex were significantly different compared to their conventional counterpart. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the free water fraction in FWE MRI with echo time dependence is a valuable biomarker, sensitive to the progressive degeneration in ischaemic tissue. We showed that part of the heterogeneity previously observed in conventional parameter maps can be accounted for by a heterogeneous distribution of free water in the tissue. Our results suggest that the temporal evolution of the free fluid fraction map at the core and inner border zone can be associated with the pathological changes linked to the evolution

N2  -  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an uncommon inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and can be defined strictly as scattered focal or multifocal (disseminated) inflammation of brain or spinal cord, or both. An ADEM usually reveals patchy demyelinated lesions with a high signal on T-2-weighted sequences. Here, we report a case of a 39-year-old mail with ADEM. Echo-planar"trace" diffusion magnetic resonance imaging revealed high signal intensity changes at the lesion sites on b=1000 s/mm(2) images, initially suggesting restricted diffusion. On corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, however, the lesions have a high signal intensity and high ADC values, compared with the normal white matter. This was consistent with the presence of elevated diffusion, and hence, vasogenic edema.

N2  -  Early reperfusion following stroke results in reduced tissue injury. Paradoxically, restoration of blood flow under certain conditions may also cause delayed neuronal damage (reperfusion injury). The interrelationship of changes in T1, T2 and diffusion weighted images of tissue water were studied in mouse models of permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia. A sham surgery or either permanent or transient (30 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were induced in 14 mice. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain were acquired including: T2 maps, T1 maps and diffusion weighted spin-echo images to produce apparent diffusion coefficient of water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Images were collected on average 90 min after MCAO in both the transient and permanent ischemia groups. Scans were repeated at 24 h post-occlusion in mice with transient ischemia. Permanent MCAO resulted in decreases in ADC and no significant change in T2 acutely following MCAO. There were increases in T1 compared to sham controls within the ischemic region in mice following either transient or permanent MCAO (P<0.001). In contrast to permanent MCAO, there were increases in T2 (P<0.001) in the infarct area present in the reperfusion phase within 90 min of transient MCAO. There was considerable infarct growth at 24 h (P<0.001). This study demonstrates that following either type of occlusion there are early increases in T1 suggesting an elevated water content in the stroke lesion, while only following transient MCAO are there early increases in T2, indicative of early vasogenic oedema with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.

N2  -  Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a dynamic process caused by disruptive lesions affecting components of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT). The authors applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate longitudinal changes of the GMT components in a child with HOD after neurosurgery for a midbrain tumor. Diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired on a 1.5-T MRI scanner using a balanced pair of diffusion gradients along 20 noncollinear directions 1 day and 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery. Measurements from regions of interest (ROIs) were sampled in the affected inferior olivary nucleus, ipsilateral red nucleus, and contralateral superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles and dentate nucleus. For each ROT, fractional anisotropy and the mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated. In the affected inferior olivary nucleus, the authors found a decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean, axial, and radial diffusivities 3 months after surgery, while 3 months later fractional anisotropy increased and diffusivities decreased. For all other GMT components, changes in DTI scalars were less pronounced, and fractional anisotropy mildly decreased over time. A detailed analysis of longitudinal DTI scalars in the various GMT components may shed light on a better understanding of the dynamic complex histopathological processes occurring in pediatric HOD over time.

N2  -  In this study, the uninjured periventricular area of a female patient who presented with complete paralysis of the left extremities following middle cerebral artery infarction was analyzed using diffusion tensor tractography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor tractography revealed interrupted corticospinal tract at the infarct lesion in the corona radiata at 2 weeks after onset, which descended through the spared periventricular area at 6 months after onset. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a motor pathway of the affected hand that was compatible with the lateral corticospinal tract. At 6 months after onset, motor function in the affected extremities recovered to normal levels, which suggested that motor function in the affected hand recovered by the corticospinal tract that passed through the spared periventricular area. The arterial territory of the spared periventricular area corresponded with the anterior choroidal artery. These results suggest that care should be taken in spared periventricular areas in patients with lesions at the corona radiata level.

N2  -  We present the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of five patients with acute Wernicke's encephalopathy. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images demonstrated symmetrical hyperintense lesions within the dorsomedial thalami, periaqueductal white matter, and the tectum of the midbrain. None of the lesions enhanced with gadolinium. In addition to conventional MRI sequences, we performed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). In all patients, DWI showed symmetrical pathologic thalamic and midbrain signal hyperintensities more distinctly than did conventional T2-weighted or FLAIR sequences. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map images showed slight signal reductions in four patients, suggesting restricted diffusion within these regions. In one patient, the signal intensity within the affected thalami was isointense with the ipsilateral basal ganglia on ADC map images. For enhanced detection of pathology, we conclude that DWI should be included in the imaging protocols of patients suspected to suffer from Wernicke's encephalopathy.

N2  -  In the central nervous system, gliomas are the most common, but complex primary tumors. Genome-based molecular and clinical studies have revealed different classifications and subtypes of gliomas. Neuroradiological approaches have non-invasively provided a macroscopic view for surgical resection and therapeutic effects. The connectome is a structural map of a physical object, the brain, which raises issues of spatial scale and definition, and it is calculated through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI. In this study, we reviewed the basic principles and attributes of the structural and functional connectome, followed by the alternations of connectomes and their influences on glioma. To extend the applications of connectome, we demonstrated that a series of multi-center projects still need to be conducted to systemically investigate the connectome and the structural-functional coupling of glioma. Additionally, the brain-computer interface based on accurate connectome could provide more precise structural and functional data, which are significant for surgery and postoperative recovery. Besides, integrating the data from different sources, including connectome and other omics information, and their processing with artificial intelligence, together with validated biological and clinical findings will be significant for the development of a personalized surgical strategy.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging is a technique that enables physicians the portrayal of white matter tracts in vivo. We used this technique in order to depict the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in 15 consecutive patients between 2012 and 2015. Men and women of all ages were included. There were six women and nine men. The mean age was 58.6 years (39-77). Nine patients were candidates for an eventual deep brain stimulation. Eight of them suffered from Parkinson's disease and one had multiple sclerosis. The remaining six patients suffered from different lesions which were situated in the frontal lobe. These were 2 metastasis, 2 meningiomas, 1 cerebral bleeding, and 1 glioblastoma. We used a 3DT1-sequence for the navigation. Furthermore 12- and DTI- sequences were performed. The FOV was 200 x 200 mm(2), slice thickness 2 mm, and an acquisition matrix of 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 X 2 x 2 mm. 3-Tesla-MRI was carried out strictly axial using 32 gradient directions and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2. b-value was 800 s/mm(2). The maximal angle was 50 degrees. Additional scanning time was <9 min. We were able to visualize the MFB in 12 of our patients bilaterally and in the remaining three patients we depicted the MFB on one side. It was the contralateral side of the lesion. These were 2 meningiomas and one metastasis. Portrayal of the MFB is possible for everyday routine for neurosurgical interventions. As part of the reward circuitry it might be of substantial importance for neurosurgeons during deep brain stimulation in patients with psychiatric disorders. Surgery in this part of the brain should always take the preservation of this white matter tract into account.

N2  -  Objectives To determine whether radiomics features derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) can improve the differentiation between radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) and tumor recurrence (TR) in glioma patients.
Methods A total of 4199 radiomics features were extracted from conventional MRI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps, obtained from 96 pathologically confirmed WHO grade 2 similar to 4 gliomas with enhancement after standard treatment. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to test segmentation stability between two doctors. Radiomics features were selected using the Mann-Whitney U test, LASSO regression, and RFE algorithms. Four machine learning classifiers were adopted to establish radiomics models. The diagnostic performance of multiparameter, conventional, and single-parameterMRI radiomics models was compared using the area under the curve (AUC). The models were evaluated in the subsequent independent validation set (n = 30).; Results Eight important radiomics features (3 from conventional MRI, 1 from ADC, and 4 from CBF) were selected. Support vector machine (SVM) was chosen as the optimal classifier. The diagnostic performance of the multiparameter MRI radiomics model (AUC 0.96) was higher than that of the conventional MRI (AUC 0.88), ADC (AUC 0.91), and CBF (AUC 0.95) radiomics models. For subgroup analysis, the multiparameter MRI radiomics model showed similar performance, with AUCs of 0.98 in WHO grade 2 similar to 3 and 0.96 in WHO grade 4.; Conclusion The incorporation of noninvasive DWI and ASL into the MRI radiomics model improved the diagnostic performance in differentiating RIBI from TR; ASL, especially, played a significant role.

N2  -  A 54-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman presented with glioblastoma manifesting as seizure and headache, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging of the two patients revealed hypointense area on T-1-weighted imaging, and hyperintense area on T-2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, with no enhancement after gadolinium administration. Both patients underwent conservative therapy under diagnoses of non-neoplastic cerebral lesion. Six months later, they suffered aggravated symptoms and new neurological deficits. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed hypointense area on diffusion-weighted imaging and ring enhancement on T-1-weighted imaging with gadolinium at the site of the previously detected lesions. The tumors showed growth pattern of superficial origin. The large enhanced masses were totally removed through craniotomy under neuronavigator guidance. The histological diagnoses were glioblastoma. Glioblastoma may mimic non-neoplastic conditions on neuroimaging in the early stages. Close follow up of such patients is essential.

N2  -  Anti-inflammatory therapy has provided hope for a new effective treatment of brain ischemic stroke. In this study, adult male Wistar rats subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 60 min were allocated to treatment of the anti-inflammatory compound alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or saline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology were used to evaluate the effects of alpha-MSH. MRI volumetry was performed to measure infarct size, and MRI measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed to evaluate changes in the extra/intracellular volume ratio. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used as a reference method to measure infarct sizes. The ADC value of the infarct area decreased significantly two days after MCAO in both groups. Simultaneously the infarct volume determined from the ADC map decreased in the a-MSH treated group compared to the control group. Five days after MCAO, ADC returned to baseline levels in both groups. The infarct volume in the a-MSH group was smaller compared to the saline treated group as demonstrated both by MRI and TTC staining. This study showed that the extra/intracellular ratio (reflected by ADC) following focal brain ischemic stroke could be affected by alpha-MSH. Secondly, we showed that the infarct volume was reduced by alpha-MSH. The volumetric dimensions of the infarct areas measured by MRI were comparable to those measured by histology.

N2  -  There is evidence from histopathological studies that glioma tumor cells migrate preferentially along large white matter bundles. If the peritumoral white matter structures can be used to predict the likely trajectory of migrating tumor cells outside of the surgical margin, then this information could be used to inform the delineation of radiation therapy (RT) targets. In theory, an anisotropic expansion that takes large white matter bundle anatomy into account may maximize the chances of treating migrating cancer cells and minimize the amount of brain tissue exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) can be used in combination with fiber tracking algorithms to model the trajectory of large white matter pathways using the direction and magnitude of water movement in tissue. The method presented here is a tool for translating a DW-MRI fiber tracking (tractography) dataset into a white matter path length (WMPL) map that assigns each voxel the shortest distance along a streamline back to a specified region of interest (ROI). We present an open-source WMPL tool, implemented in the package Diffusion Imaging in Python (DIPY), and code to convert the resulting WMPL map to anisotropic contours for RT in a commercial treatment planning system. This proof-of-concept lays the groundwork for future studies to evaluate the clinical value of incorporating tractography modeling into treatment planning.

N2  -  In this study, we established a Wistar rat model of right middle cerebral artery occlusion and observed pathological imaging changes (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], T(2)FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) following cerebral infarction. The pathological changes were divided into three phases: early cerebral infarction, middle cerebral infarction, and late cerebral infarction. In the early cerebral infarction phase (less than 2 hours post-infarction), there was evidence of intracellular edema, which improved after reperfusion. This improvement was defined as the ischemic penumbra. In this phase, a high DWI signal and a low apparent diffusion coefficient were observed in the right basal ganglia region. By contrast, there were no abnormal T2WI and T(2)FLAIR signals. For the middle cerebral infarction phase (2-4 hours post-infarction), a mixed edema was observed. After reperfusion, there was a mild improvement in cell edema, while the angioedema became more serious. A high DWI signal and a low apparent diffusion coefficient signal were observed, and some rats showed high T2WI and T(2)FLAIR signals. For the late cerebral infarction phase (4-6 hours post-infarction), significant angioedema was visible in the infarction site. After reperfusion, there was a significant increase in angioedema, while there was evidence of hemorrhage and necrosis. A mixed signal was observed on DWI, while a high apparent diffusion coefficient signal, a high T2WI signal, and a high T(2)FLAIR signal were also observed. All 86 cerebral infarction patients were subjected to T2WI, T(2)FLAIR, and DWI. MRI results of clinic data similar to the early infarction phase of animal experiments were found in 51 patients, for which 10 patients (10/51) had an onset time greater than 6 hours. A total of 35 patients had MRI results similar to the middle and late infarction phase of animal experiments, of which eight patients (8/35) had an onset time less than 6 hours. These data suggest that defining the "therapeutic time window" as the time 6 hours after infarction may not be suitable for all patients. Integrated application of MRI sequences including T2WI, T(2)FLAIR, DW-MRI, and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping should be used to examine the ischemic penumbra, which may provide valuable information for identifying the "therapeutic time window".

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: Q-space analysis using high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) data provides information on tissue microstructure in contrast to conventional MR imaging (MRI) based on low b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of mean displacement (MDP) map in stroke patients using q-space diffusion-weighted MRI (QSI).
Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients presenting with a total of 22 acute or subacute cerebral infarctions were included. MR protocol consisted of conventional MR sequences, DWI (b-value; 1000 smm(2)) and QSI (b-value; maximum 12,000 smm2). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of conventional DWI and MOP maps of QSI data were obtained and compared in the ischemic lesions and corresponding normal tissues.; Results: Decreased ADC values were present in all lesions. There was no correlation between ADC and MOP values in the lesions (r = 0.21). MOP values of the lesions were 8.60 +- 1.26 pm (mean +- SD). Most of the lesions (1622) had higher MOP values than normal brain tissue. Three lesions showed lower MOP values and three showed mixed MOP values.; Conclusions: The MOP maps using QSI data provides additional information for stroke patients compared to conventional DWI.

N2  -  In the progression of ischemia, pH is important and is essential in elucidating the association between metabolic disruption, lactate formation, acidosis and tissue damage. Chemical exchange-dependent saturation transfer (CEST) imaging can be used to detect tissue pH and, in particular, a specific form of CEST magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), termed amide proton transfer (APT) MRI, which is sensitive to pH and can detect ischemic lesions, even prior to diffusion abnormalities. The critical parameter governing the ability of CEST to detect pH is the sequence. In the present study, a novel strategy was used, based on the gradient echo sequence (GRE), which involved the insertion of a magnetization transfer pulse in each repetition time (TR) and minimizing the TR for in vivo APT imaging. The proposed GRE-APT MRI method was initially verified using a tissue-like pH phantom and optimized MRI parameters for APT imaging. In order to assess the range of acute cerebral infarction, rats (n=4) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and MRI scanning at 7 telsa (T). Hyperacute ischemic tissue damage was characterized using multiparametric imaging techniques, including diffusion, APT and T-2-Weighted MRI. By using a magnetization transfer pulse and minimizing TR, GRE-APT provided high spatial resolution and a homogeneous signal, with clearly distinguished cerebral anatomy. The GRE-APT and diffusion MRI were significantly correlated with lactate content and the area of cerebral infarction in the APT and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps matched consistently during the hyperacute period. In addition, compared with the infarction area observed on the ADC MRI map, the APT map contained tissue, which had not yet been irreversibly damaged. Therefore, GRE-APT MRI waa able to detect ischemic lactic acidosis with sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, suggesting the potential use of pH MRI as a surrogate imaging marker of impaired tissue metabolism for the diagnosis and prognosis of hyperacute stroke.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The clinical outcomes for patients undergoing resection of diffuse glioma within the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) are understudied. Anatomically, the MFG is richly interconnected to known language areas, and nearby subcortical fibers are at risk during resection. The goal of this study was to determine the functional outcomes and intraoperative mapping results related to resection of MFG gliomas. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate if subcortical tract disruption on imaging correlated with functional outcomes. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of 39 patients with WHO grade II-IV diffuse gliomas restricted to only the MFG and underlying subcortical region that were treated with resection and had no prior treatment. Intraoperative mapping results and postoperative neurological deficits by discharge and 90 days were assessed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was used to assess subcortical tract integrity on pre- and postoperative imaging. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 37.9 years at surgery, and the median follow-up was 5.1 years. The mean extent of resection was 98.9% for the cohort. Of the 39 tumors, 24 were left sided (61.5%). Thirty-six patients (92.3%) underwent intraoperative mapping, with 59% of patients undergoing an awake craniotomy. No patients had positive cortical mapping sites overlying the tumor, and 12 patients (33.3%) had positive subcortical stimulation sites. By discharge, 8 patients had language dysfunction, and 5 patients had mild weakness. By 90 days, 2 patients (5.1%) had persistent mild hand weakness only. There were no persistent language deficits by 90 days. On univariate analysis, preoperative tumor size (p = 0.0001), positive subcortical mapping (p = 0.03), preoperative tumor invasion of neighboring subcortical tracts on DTI tractography (p = 0.0003), and resection cavity interruption of subcortical tracts on DTI tractography (p < 0.0001) were associated with an increased risk of having a postoperative deficit by discharge. There were no instances of complete subcortical tract transections in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS MFG diffuse gliomas may undergo extensive resection with minimal risk for long-term morbidity. Partial subcortical tract interruption may lead to transient but not permanent deficits. Subcortical mapping is essential to reduce permanent morbidity during resection of MFG tumors by avoiding complete transection of critical subcortical tracts.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has become one of the most important imaging modalities for noninvasively probing tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis MRI (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion, which in turn has been shown to increase sensitivity towards, e.g., disease and orientation mapping in neural tissue. However, the specificity of DKI is limited as different sources can contribute to the total intravoxel diffusional kurtosis, including: variance in diffusion tensor magnitudes (K-iso), variance due to diffusion anisotropy (K-aniso), and microscopic kurtosis ( mu K ) related to restricted diffusion, microstructural disorder, and/or exchange. Interestingly, mu K is typically ignored in diffusion MRI signal modelling as it is assumed to be negligible in neural tissues. However, recently, Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI) based on Double-Diffusion-Encoding (DDE) was introduced for kurtosis source separation, revealing non negligible mu K in preclinical imaging. Here, we implemented CTI for the first time on a clinical 3T scanner and investigated the sources of total kurtosis in healthy subjects. A robust framework for kurtosis source separation in humans is introduced, followed by estimation of mu K (and the other kurtosis sources) in the healthy brain. Using this clinical CTI approach, we find that mu K significantly contributes to total diffusional kurtosis both in grey and white matter tissue but, as expected, not in the ventricles. The first mu K maps of the human brain are presented, revealing that the spatial distribution of mu K provides a unique source of contrast, appearing different from isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis counterparts. Moreover, group average templates of these kurtosis sources have been generated for the first time, which corroborated our findings at the underlying individual-level maps. We further show that the common practice of ignoring mu K and assuming the multiple Gaussian component approximation for kurtosis source estimation introduces significant bias in the estimation of other kurtosis sources and, perhaps even worse, compromises their interpretation. Finally, a twofold acceleration of CTI is discussed in the context of potential future clinical applications. We conclude that CTI has much potential for future in vivo microstructural characterizations in healthy and pathological tissue.

N2  -  Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common source of morbidity from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. With no overt lesions on structural MRI, diagnosis of chronic mild TBI in military veterans relies on obtaining an accurate history and assessment of behavioral symptoms that are also associated with frequent comorbid disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Military veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan with mild TBI (n = 30) with comorbid PTSD and depression and non-TBI participants from primary (n = 42) and confirmatory (n = 28) control groups were assessed with high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). White matter-specific registration followed by whole-brain voxelwise analysis of crossing fibers provided separate partial volume fractions reflecting the integrity of primary fibers and secondary (crossing) fibers. Loss of white matter integrity in primary fibers (P < 0.05; corrected) was associated with chronic mild TBI in a widely distributed pattern of major fiber bundles and smaller peripheral tracts including the corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), forceps minor, forceps major, superior and posterior corona radiata, internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and others. Distributed loss of white matter integrity correlated with duration of loss of consciousness and most notably with feeling dazed or confused, but not diagnosis of PTSD or depressive symptoms. This widespread spatial extent of white matter damage has typically been reported in moderate to severe TBI. The diffuse loss of white matter integrity appears consistent with systemic mechanisms of damage shared by blast- and impact-related mild TBI that involves a cascade of inflammatory and neurochemical events.

N2  -  RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopic findings of the hyperacute stage of cerebral fat embolism in cats and the time needed for the development of vasogenic edema.
METHODS. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 30 minutes (group 1, n = 9) and at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after embolization with triolein (group 2, n = 10). As a control for group 2, the same acquisition was obtained after embolization with polyvinyl alcohol particles (group 3, n = 5). Magnetic resonance images were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Electron microscopic examination was done in all cats.; RESULTS. In group 1, the lesions were iso- or slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion-weighted (DWIs) images, hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map image, and markedly enhanced on the gadolinium-enhanced Tl-weighted images (Gd-T1WIs). In group 2 at 30 minutes, the lesions were similar to those in group 1. Thereafter, the lesions became more hyperintense on T2WIs and DWIs and more hypointense on the ADC map image. The lesions were enhanced on Gd-T1WIs at all acquisition times. In group 3, the lesions showed mild hyperintensity on T2WIs at 6 hours but hypointensity on the ADC map image from 30 minutes, with a tendency toward a greater decrease over time. The lesions were not enhanced on Gd-T1WIs at any time point. Electron microscopic findings revealed discontinuity of the capillary endothelial wall, perivascular and interstitial edema, and swelling of glial and neuronal cells in groups 1 and 2. Cellular swelling and interstitial edema were more prominent in group 2. In group 3, interstitial edema was seen; however, discontinuity of the endothelial wall was absent.; CONCLUSIONS. The lesions were hyperintense on T2WIs and DWIs, hypointense on the ADC map image, and enhanced on Gd-T1WIs. On electron microscopy, the lesions showed cytotoxic and vasogenic edema with disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Vasogenic edema seems to develop within 30 minutes in cerebral fat embolism in cats.

N2  -  Objective: On diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, posterior fossa tumors may exhibit the various signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflecting their histology and cellularity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ADC and tumor cellularity in medulloblastoma and other posterior fossa tumors.
Methods: Pre-operative diffusion-weighted MR images were retrospectively reviewed in 26 patients with posterior fossa neoplasms: 11 medulloblastomas, one atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor (ATRT), four glioblastomas, four ependymomas, three pilocytic astrocytomas and three hemangioblastomas. The minimum ADC (minADC) value of each tumor was determined on ADC maps derived from isotropic diffusion-weighted MR images. The minADC values were compared by a two-tailed t-test. Tumor cellularity measured in surgical specimens was compared with the minADC value by simple linear regression analysis.; Results: The mean minADC value of the medulloblastoma was significantly lower than those of ependymoma, pilocytic astrocytoma and hemangioblastoma without overlap in the range of minADC values. Therefore, medulloblastomas could be clearly differentiated by absolute minADC values. ATRT and glioblastoma had similar minADC values to medulloblastoma. Tumor cellularity was negatively correlated with the minADC value in medulloblastomas and other posterior fossa tumors.; Discussion: The low minADC value of medulloblastomas reflects the high tumor cellularity. Analysis of ADC values has high predictive value for the differentiation of medulloblastoma from other posterior fossa tumors. Neurol Res 2009; 31: 940-946

N2  -  Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and hippocampal atrophy are related to verbal memory failures and may ultimately result in Alzheimer's disease. However, verbal memory failures are often present before structural changes on conventional MRI appear. Changes in microstructural integrity of the hippocampus, which cannot be detected with conventional MRI, may be the underlying pathological substrate. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated the relation between the microstructural integrity of the hippocampus and verbal memory performance in 503 nondemented elderly with SVD. Methods: The Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion tensor and Magnetic resonance imaging Cohort study is a prospective cohort study among 503 nondemented elderly with cerebral SVD aged between 50 and 85 years. All participants underwent T1 MPRAGE, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, DTI scanning and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. After manual segmentation of the hippocampi, we calculated the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy in both hippocampi. The relation between memory performance and hippocampal DTI parameters was adjusted for age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, hippocampal, and white-matter lesions volume and lacunar infarcts. Results: We found inverse relations between hippocampal MD and verbal memory performance (beta = -0.22; P < 0.001), immediate recall (beta = -0.22; P < 0.001), delayed recall (beta = -0.20; P < 0.001), and forgetting rate (beta = -0.13; P = 0.025), most pronounced in participants with a normal hippocampal volume. Conclusion: Microstructural integrity of the hippocampus assessed by DTI is related to verbal memory performance in elderly with SVD, also in participants with an intact appearing hippocampus. Changes in hippocampal microstructure may be an early marker of underlying neurodegenerative disease, before macrostructural (i.e., volumetric) changes occur. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

N2  -  The goal of this study is to spatially discriminate tumor from treatment effect (TE), within the contrast-enhancing lesion, for brain tumor patients at all stages of treatment. To this end, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI-derived diffusion and perfusion parameters to distinguish pure TE from pure glioblastoma (GBM) was determined utilizing spatially-correlated biopsy samples. From July 2010 through June 2015, brain tumor patients who underwent pre-operative DWI and DSC-MRI and stereotactic image-guided biopsy were considered for inclusion in this IRB-approved study. MRI-derived parameter maps included apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), normalized cerebral blood flow (nCBF), normalized and standardized relative cerebral blood volume (nRCBV, sRCBV), peak signal-height (PSR) and percent signal-recovery (PSR). These were co-registered to the Stealth MRI and median values extracted from the spatially-matched biopsy regions. A ROC analysis accounting for multiple subject samples was performed, and the optimal threshold for distinguishing TE from GBM determined for each parameter. Histopathologic diagnosis of pure TE (n = 10) or pure GBM (n = 34) was confirmed in tissue samples from 15 consecutive subjects with analyzable data. Perfusion thresholds of sRCBV (3575; SN/SP% = 79.4/90.0), nRCBV (1.13; SN/SP% = 82.1/90.0), and nCBF (1.05; SN/SP% = 79.4/80.0) distinguished TE from GBM (P < 0.05), whereas ADC, PSR, and PH could not (P > 0.05). The thresholds for CBF and CBV can be applied to lesions with any admixture of tumor or treatment effect, enabling the identification of true tumor burden within enhancing lesions. This approach overcomes current limitations of averaging values from both tumor and TE for quantitative assessments.

N2  -  Brain abscesses (BAs) are focal infections of the central nervous system (CNS) that start as a localised area of weakening of the brain parenchyma (cerebritis) and develops into a collection of pus surrounded by a capsule. Pyogenic (bacterial) BAs represent the majority of all BAs; in some cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic management can be challenging. Imaging has a primary role in differentiating BAs from other lesions. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is essential for the identification of the lesion, its localisation and its morphological features. However, cMRI does not allow to reliably differentiate BAs from other intracranial mass lesions such as necrotic tumours. Advanced sequences, such as diffu-sion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and proton MR spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) are very useful in the differential diagnosis from other brain lesions, such as non-pyogenic abscesses or necrotic tumours, and provide essential information on structural, vascular and meta-bolic characteristics allowing greater neuroradiological confidence. The aim of this pictorial review is to provide a practical approach showing the added value of more advanced MRI techniques in their diagnostic management.

N2  -  Radiation to the brain and adjuvant chemotherapy may produce late delayed changes from several months to years after treatment of intracranial malignancies with a reported prevalence of 5-24%. The pattern of treatment-related injury may vary from diffuse periventricular white matter lesions to focal or multifocal lesions. Differentiation of treatment-related injury from tumor progression/recurrence may be difficult with conventional MR imaging (MRI). With both disease processes, the characteristic but nonspecific imaging features are vasogenic edema, contrast enhancement, and mass effect. This pictorial essay presents MRI spectra of late therapy-induced injuries in the brain with a particular emphasis on radiation necrosis, the most common and severe form. Novel MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), proton MR spectroscopy (MRS), and perfusion MRI, improve the possibilities of better characterization of treatment-related changes. Advanced MRI techniques allow for the assessment of metabolism and physiology and may increase specificity for therapy-induced changes.

N2  -  Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults and children. Recently, we have developed an adult rat model of minor stroke containing a peri-infarct region with a modest T-2 increase and mild ischemic damage. We hypothesized that a neonatal minor stroke with mild peri-ischemic changes could also be produced, but with potential ontogenic differences. Using our minor photothrombosis method, we produced a range of severities of ischemic lesions (mini, minor, moderate and severe) within magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices of adult and neonatal rats. In both age groups, the lesion region showed a marked increase in T-2 and diffusion-weighted intensity and decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), corresponding to a cortical infarct detected using fluorojade and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Perilesional regions showed modest increases in T-2 and ADC in adults, but not neonates, and this corresponded to scattered cell death, but not necessarily extravasation of plasma protein, i.e. blood-brain barrier disruption. Mini and minor insults in neonates generally showed homogeneous and rather modest changes in T-2 and ADC. MR perfusion maps demonstrated a penumbral area of greater hypoperfusion in adults compared with neonates. Together, the results indicate that, in neonatal cortex, a similar severity of photothrombosis occurs throughout the area of photoactivation, whereas, in adult brain, spontaneous clot lysis and/or partial thrombosis occurs adjacent to permanently occluded vessels. Thus, by comparing differing severities of photothrombotic ischemia in neonates and adults, ontogenic differences were detectable using MRI, with mature brain having a greater penumbral region. Mild ischemic injury and scattered cell death in both neonates and adults could be identified by a modest increase in T-2 and decrease in ADC. A better understanding of the effects of development on ischemic responses and associated MRI changes will provide a basis for the improved diagnosis of mild or minor ischemic insults relevant to pediatric and adult stroke.

N2  -  The parameters that characterize the intricate water diffusion in tumors may serve to reveal their distinct pathology. Specifically, the application of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid in characterizing breast cancer, as well as monitoring response to therapy. We present here a non-invasive, quantitative MRI investigation, at high spatial resolution, of water diffusion in hormonal dependent MCF7 breast tumors implanted orthotopically in immunodeficient mice. Distinctive MRI protocols were designed in this study, utilizing a broad range of diffusion times and diffusion gradient strengths. Application of these protocols allowed water diffusion in the tissue extracellular and intracellular compartments to be distinguished, and the effect of restricted diffusion and water exchange on the water diffusion in these compartments to be evaluated. Pixel-by-pixel analysis yielded parametric maps of the estimated volume fraction and apparent diffusion coefficient of each compartment. The diffusion of the water in the extracellular microenvironment was approximately two fold slower than that of free water, and in the intracellular compartment was about one order of magnitude slower than that of free water and demonstrated restriction of water diffusion at long diffusion times. Mapping of the water fraction in each compartment was further employed to monitor changes during tumor progression and to assess tumor response to hormonal manipulation with a new antiestrogenic drug, tamoxifen methiodide (TMI). It was found that, in parallel to the growth arrest by this drug, the volume fraction of the slowly diffusing water increased, suggesting a TMI-induced cell swelling. This study can serve as a basis for extending diffusion breast MRI in the clinical setting. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Standards for residual tumour measurement after resection of gliomas with no or minimal enhancement have not yet been established. In this study residual volumes on early and late postoperative T2-/FLAIR-weighted MRI are compared.
A retrospective cohort included 58 consecutive glioma patients with no or minimal preoperative gadolinium enhancement. Inclusion criteria were first-time resection between 2007 and 2009 with a T2-FLAIR-based target volume and availability of preoperative, early (< 48 h) and late (1-7 months) postoperative MRI. The volumes of non-enhancing T2FLAIR tissue and diffusion restriction areas were measured.; Residual tumour volumes were 22% smaller on late postoperative compared with early postoperative T2-weighted MRI and 49% smaller for FLAIR-weighted imaging. Postoperative restricted diffusion volume correlated with the difference between early and late postoperative FLAIR volumes and with the difference between T2 and FLAIR volumes on early postoperative MRI.; We observed a systematic and substantial overestimation of residual non-enhancing volume on MRI within 48 h of resection compared with months postoperatively, in particular for FLAIR imaging. Resection-induced ischaemia contributes to this overestimation, as may other operative effects. This indicates that early postoperative MRI is less reliable to determine the extent of non-enhancing residual glioma and restricted diffusion volumes are imperative.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) provide useful data for tumor evaluation. To assess the contribution of these multimodal techniques in grading glial neoplasms, we compared the value of DWI, PWI and MRS in the evaluation of histologically proven high- and low-grade gliomas in a population of 105 patients.
Independently for each modality, the following variables were used to compare the tumors: minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) normalized values between tumor and healthy tissue, maximum ChoCr ratio and minimum NAACr ratio in tumor, and scored lactate and lipid values in tumor. The Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were employed to compare DWI, PWI and MRS between tumor types. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which parameters best increased the diagnostic accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. ROC curves were determined for parameters with high sensitivity and specificity to identify threshold values to separate high- from low-grade lesions.; Statistically significant differences were found for rCBV tumornormal tissue ratio, and NAACr ratio in tumor and ChoCr ratio in tumor between low- and high-grade tumors. The best performing single parameter for group classification was the normalized rCBV value; including all parameters, statistical significance was reached by rCBV tumornormal tissue ratio, NAACr tumor ratio and lactate. From the ROC curves, a high probability for a neoplasm to be a high-grade lesion was associated with a rCBV tumornormal tissue ratio of > 1.16 and NAACr tumor ratio of < 0.44.; Combining PWI and MRS with conventional MR imaging increases the accuracy of the attribution of malignancy to glial neoplasms. The best performing parameter was found to be the perfusion level.

N2  -  A subgroup of patients with breast cancer suffers from mild cognitive impairment after chemotherapy. To uncover the neural substrate of these mental complaints, we examined cerebral white matter (WM) integrity after chemotherapy using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in combination with detailed cognitive assessment. Postchemotherapy breast cancer patients (n = 17) and matched healthy controls (n 18) were recruited for DTI and neuropsychological testing, including the self-report cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ). Differences in DTI WM integrity parameters [fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)] between patients and healthy controls were assessed using a voxel-based two-sample-t-test. In comparison with healthy controls, the patient group demonstrated decreased FA in frontal and temporal WM tracts and increased MD in frontal WM. These differences were also confirmed when comparing this patient group with an additional control group of nonchemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients (n 10). To address the heterogeneity observed in cognitive function after chemotherapy, we performed a voxel-based correlation analysis between FA values and individual neuropsychological test scores. Significant correlations of FA with neuropsychological tests covering the domain of attention and processing/psychomotor speed were found in temporal and parietal WM tracts. Furthermore, CFQ scores correlated negatively in frontal and parietal WM. These studies show that chemotherapy seems to affect WM integrity and that parameters derived from DTI have the required sensitivity to quantify neural changes related to chemotherapy-induced mild cognitive impairment.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed without doubt to the most important investigation method in multiple sclerosis. MRI is very sensitive to detect MS lesions but unfortunately of limited specificity. The purpose of this review is 1. to work up the MRI characteristics of MS lesions, 2. to derive recommendations for MRT-protocolls for daily radiological work and 3. to discuss new MR developments.
MS lesions in the acute inflammatory stage show first an enhancement of GD-DTPA due to break down of the blood brain barrier and develop a T2-hyperintensity due to an edema. The following disease course is categorized in a phase of reparation and remyelinisation respectively, of gliosis and a defect stage. MS-plaques in the remyelinisation and gliotic phase appear as hyperintens lesion on T2-weighted scans. Chronic MS lesions with a defect are also T2-hyperintens and demonstrate additionally due to severe axonal loss a hypointensity on short TR SE scans.; MS lesions exhibit a characteristic distribution. They are found typically periventricular, in the corpus callosum and at the calloso-septal interface, cortico-subcortical and infratentorial. The most important MR criteria to predict conversion from suspected (CSMS) to clinical definite MS (CDMS) are GD-DTPA enhancement and juxtacortical lesion localisation followed by the parameter periventricular and infratentorial localisation.; Based on guidelines for the use of MRI in drug studies and on equivalent recommendations for the routine diagnostic we suggest rational and economic MRT protocols for cerebral, spinal, and N. opticus investigations. Such standardised protocols shall help to make MRI investigations more efficient and better comparable. New MR developments include measurement of magnetisation transfer and T2-relaxation, diffusion weighted imaging, proton MR spectroscopy, and quantification of lesion load. These methods can analyse more specifically tissue changes in MS plaques and yet can reveal changes in normal appearing white matter.

N2  -  Purpose: To characterize therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstems of childhood brain tumor patients by serial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Methods and Materials: We analyzed 109 DTI studies from 20 brain tumor patients, aged 4 to 23 years, with normal-appearing brainstems included in the treatment fields. Those with medulloblastomas, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n = 10) received postoperative craniospinal irradiation (23.4-39.6 Gy) and a cumulative dose of 55.8 Gy to the primary site, followed by four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade gliomas (n = 10) received erlotinib during and after irradiation (54-59.4 Gy). Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were computed and spatially registered to three-dimensional radiation dose data. Volumes of interest included corticospinal tracts, medial lemnisci, and the pons. Serving as an age-related benchmark for comparison, 37 DTI studies from 20 healthy volunteers, aged 6 to 25 years, were included in the analysis.; Results: The median DTI follow-up time was 3.5 years (range, 1.6-5.0 years). The median mean dose to the pons was 56 Gy (range, 7-59 Gy). Three patterns were seen in longitudinal FA and apparent diffusion coefficient changes: (1) a stable or normal developing time trend, (2) initial deviation from normal with subsequent recovery, and (3) progressive deviation without evidence of complete recovery. The maximal decline in FA often occurred 1.5 to 3.5 years after the start of radiation therapy. A full recovery time trend could be observed within 4 years. Patients with incomplete recovery often had a larger decline in FA within the first year. Radiation dose alone did not predict long-term recovery patterns.; Conclusions: Variations existed among individual patients after therapy in longitudinal evolution of brainstem white matter injury and recovery. Early response in brainstem anisotropy may serve as an indicator of the recovery time trend over 5 years after radiation therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Reversible corpus callosum splenial (CCS) lesions are rare findings and usually detected incidentally. We presented a case of 15-year-old boy with a diagnoses of nephrotic syndrome. He was referred for neuropsychiatric symptoms following dose reduction on steroid treatment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal lesion in the CCS, hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR and hypointense on T1 images with diffusion restriction on apparent diffusion coefficient map. Follow-up MRI 3 weeks later showed complete resolution of the lesion. It was probably result of focal intramyelinic edema due to excytotoxic mechanisms and/or arginine-vasopressin release.

N2  -  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disorder characterized by progressive and irreversible loss of muscular function. As muscular disease progresses, the repair mechanisms cannot compensate for cellular damage, leading inevitably to necrosis and progressive replacement by fibrous and fatty tissue. Cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure are the main causes of death in DMD. In addition to the well-described muscle and heart disease, cognitive dysfunction affects around 30% of DMD boys. Myocardial fibrosis, assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), is an early marker of heart involvement in both DMD patients and female carriers. In parallel, brain MRI identifies smaller total brain volume, smaller grey matter volume, lower white matter fractional anisotropy and higher white matter radial diffusivity in DMD patients. The in vivo brain evaluation of mdx mice, a surrogate animal model of DMD, showed an increased inorganic phosphate (P(i))/phosphocreatine (PCr) and pH. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach using techniques of magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging as a tool to create a heart and brain imaging map in DMD patients that could potentially facilitate the patients' risk stratification and also future research studies in the field.

N2  -  Although extensive surgical resection represents the first treatment in brain tumors. the risk of postoperative sequelae still persists. Consequently, neurosurgical procedure should be adapted to (1) the behavior of the tumor (2) its cerebral location (3) the individual functional organization of the brain (4) the dynamic interactions between these parameters.
I first review the advantages and limitations of the non-invasive metabolic (SPECT, PET, SRM, DWI). functional (PET, fMRI, NIRS, MEG) and anatomical (DTI) neuroimaging techniques, which contribute to select the surgical indications and to plan the procedure. In addition, intraoperative electrical stimulation can be used during the resection, if necessary on awake patient when cognitive functions need to be mapped, in order to detect cortico-subcortical structures functionally essential.; Second, the applications of these methods for tumor surgery are considered, with the following interests:; Finally, the results of pre-, intra- and post-operative functional mappings can be combined, to better understand both short-term and long-term plasticity mechanisms associating functional cortical reshaping and connectivity changes - due initially to the tumor growth, then to its resection.

N2  -  Purpose
Perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide important biomarkers for brain tumor analysis. Our aim was to investigate if regions of increased perfusion or tumor with restricted diffusion on the immediate post-operative MRI examination would be predictive of time to tumor progression in patients with high-grade gliomas.; Materials and methods; Twenty-three patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively analyzed. We measured the perfusion at the resection area and evaluated the presence or absence of the restricted diffusion in residual tumor masses. The associations of the perfusion, diffusion and contrast enhancement (delayed static enhancement (DSE)) characteristics with time to tumor progression were statistically calculated. We also evaluated if the location of the tumor progression was concordant to the areas of the elevated perfusion, tumor type restricted diffusion and enhancement.; Results; Patients with >200 days to progression are more likely to have no elevated relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) ratio (p = 0.0004), no tumor restriction (p = 0.024), and no DSE (p = 0.052). The elevated mean rCBV ratio (p<0.001) and tumor type restricted diffusion (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with a higher risk of progression. All cases with rCBV ratio of >1.5 progressed in 275 days or earlier. Tumors tended to progress at the area where patients with post-operative MRIs showed elevated perfusion (p = 0.006), tumor-type restricted diffusion (p = 0.005) and DSE (p = 0.008).; Conclusions; Post-operative analysis of rCBV, tumor type restricted diffusion and enhancement characteristics are predictive of time to progression, risk of progression and where tumor progression is likely to occur.

N2  -  Purpose. Metastatic complications are responsible for 90% of cancer-associated mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to observe the brain's microstructure and potentially correlate changes with metastasis occurrence. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is an MRI technique that utilizes the kinetics of water molecules within the body. The aim of this study is to use DWI to characterize diffusion changes within brain metastases in cancer patients pre- and post-stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 113 metastases from 13 patients who underwent SRS for brain metastasis recurrence. Longitudinal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were registered to Gd-T1 images and CT, and clinical metastasis ROIs from all SRS treatments were retrospectively transferred onto these ADC maps for analysis. Metastases were characterized based on pre-SRS diffusion pattern, primary cancer site, and post-SRS outcome. ADC values were calculated pre- and post-SRS. Results.ADC values were significantly elevated (980.2 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) and 1040.3 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) pre- and post-SRS, respectively) when compared to healthy brain tissue (826.8 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1)) for all metastases. Three identified pre-SRS patterns were significantly different before SRS and within 6 months post-SRS. No significant differences were observed between different primaries pre-SRS. Post-SRS, Lung metastases ADC decreased by 86.2 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1), breast metastases increased by 116.7 x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1), and genitourinary metastases showed no significant ADC change. SRS outcomes showed ADC variability pre-treatment but no significant differences pre- and post-SRS, except at 6-9 months post-SRS where progressing metastases were elevated when compared to other response groups. Conclusion. This study provided a unique opportunity to characterize diffusion changes in brain metastases before their manifestation on standard Gd-T1 images and post-SRS. Identified patterns may improve early detection of brain metastases as well as predict their response to treatment.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which almost all the organs are involved. Neuropsychiatric SLE is of one of the major concerns in the clinical evaluation of this disease. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are often nonspecific or negative. In this study, we explored the use of diffusion tensor imaging in assisting with the diagnosis of SLE.
Methods: Data from 34 SLE patients (age range, 18-73 years) and 29 age-matched volunteers (age range, 29-64 years) were analyzed. MRI was performed on a 1.5-T clinical MR scanner with a quadrature head coil. The average diffusion constant (D-av) and diffusion anisotropy maps fractional anisotropy (FA) were determined on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Regional diffusion measurements were made by region of interest in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC) and frontal lobe and thalamus. The diffusion distribution was fitted to a triple-Gaussian model. The mean of the brain tissue distribution was determined as a mean diffusion constant for the whole brain (BDav). Student's t test was used to determine the diffusion difference between SLE patients and control subjects. The SLE patients were separated into two groups according to their MRI results. A P value lower than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.; Results: Twenty of the 34 SLE patients with abnormal MRI results showed findings dominated by nonspecific white matter disease. The BDav and D-av values of the frontal lobe, splenium CC and anterior IC were significantly higher in all SLE patients as compared with the control subjects. The SLE patients with normal MRI results also showed higher BDav and (Dav) values in the frontal lobe, splenium and anterior and posterior limbs of the IC as compared with the control subjects. There was no significant difference in the Dav values of the thalamus between the SLE patients and the control subjects. The BDav value in the SLE patient group was robustly correlated with the D-av values of the frontal lobe, splenium and thalamus. These correlations were found to be similarly significant for the SLE patients with normal MRI findings. The diffusion anisotropy measurements showed that splenium CC had the highest FA value in both the control subjects and SLE patients. Overall, SLE patients had lower FA values in the genu and splenium CC as compared with the control subjects. In the group of patients with normal MRI findings, the FA values of the genu and splenium CC as well as the anterior IC were also lower than those in the control subjects. Pearson's correlation statistics revealed robust correlations between the measurements of D-av and FA values in the SLE patient group.; Conclusion: Quantitative diffusion imaging and diffusion anisotropy showed early changes in the brains of the SLE patients. Increased BDav and D-av values of the frontal lobe as well as decreased anisotropy in the genu CC and anterior IC may represent preclinical signs of central nervous system involvement of SLE even when the routine MRI findings are negative or nonspecific. Quantitative diffusion analysis may prove to be useful in detecting the initial brain involvement of SLE and may enable monitoring of early disease progression and treatment efficacy.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical application of 3-T intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI), awake craniotomy, multimodal functional mapping, and intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) for resection of dominant-sided insular gliomas.
METHODS: From March 2011 to June 2013, 30 gliomas involving the dominant insular lobe were resected in the IMRIS 3.0-T iMRI integrated neurosurgical suite. For 20 patients, awake craniotomy with cortical electrical stimulation mapping was performed to locate the language areas. For 10 patients who were not suitable for awake surgery, general anesthesia and functional navigation were performed. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography-based navigation, continuous motor evoked potential monitoring, and subcortical electrical stimulation mapping were applied to localize and monitor the motor pathway in all cases. iMRI was used to assess the extent of resection. The results of intraoperative imaging, IONM, and the surgical consequences were analyzed.; RESULTS: Intraoperative imaging revealed residual tumor in 26 cases and led to further resection in 9 cases. As a result, the median extent of resection was increased from 90% to 93% (P = 0.008) in all cases, and from 88% to 92% (P = 0.018) in low-grade gliomas. The use of iMRI also resulted in an increase in the percentage of gross and near total resection from 53% to 77% (P = 0.016). The rates of permanent language and motor deficits resulting from tumor removal were 11% and 7.1%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: The combination of iMRI, awake craniotomy, multimodal brain mapping, and IONM tailored for each patient permits the maximal safe resection of dominant-sided insular glioma.

N2  -  Background and purpose: The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the cortical apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from brain diffusion-weighted images vary with changes in the position of the subject against a static magnetic field.
Materials and methods: To focus on the variations in ADC due to the change of subject positioning, a simulation was performed using a digital brain phantom. The magnetic field inhomogeneities in the digital phantom were calculated for each subject position while changing the angle between the direction of the static field and the head of the digital phantom. The angle was changed from 0 to 40 degrees at 10-degree intervals. For each angle, the diffusion-weighted images were simulated based on magnetic resonance physics in which the magnetic field inhomogeneity was taken into account. The relative differences of average ADC values between the tilt angles were calculated to evaluate the variations in ADC. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparisons of ADC values between the tilt angles for each cortical region.; Results: In the cortical regions distorted by magnetic field inhomogeneities, the average ADC values differed significantly according to the position of the subject (P < 0.05). The range of the relative differences in average ADC values in relation to the differences in subject positioning was approximately 1% to 12%.; Conclusion: Our results suggest that subject positioning against a static field is one of the factors affecting the accuracy of cortical ADC measurements derived from brain diffusion-weighted images.

N2  -  We report on a four-year-old girl with head trauma caused by a motor vehicle accident. She presented with delirium, oculomotor palsy and ptosis in her left eye, left hemiparesis, and pyramidal signs in all extremities. Computed tomography on the day of admission showed diffuse cerebral edema with right-sided predominance. Magnetic resonance images on day 3 of admission showed lesions of diffuse axonal injury and contusion in the corpus callosum and right occipital and bilateral temporal lobes. There was a low-intensity lesion in the white matter of the right hemisphere on T2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2.-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps and diffusion-weighted images. This low-intensity lesion disappeared by day 7, and a transient brain atrophy in the right hemisphere appeared on day 28. The low signal intensity in the cerebral white matter was apparently different from that associated with contusion and typical diffuse axonal injury, and might represent a late-onset accumulation of non-heme iron and free radicals in the white matter after head trauma.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to examine the quantitative relationship between changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transverse relaxivity (Delta R(2)*) measurements of relative perfusion deficits within the gradients of a focal ischemic insult. Sixty minutes after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, rats (n = 7) were subjected to spin echo diffusion-weighted scans followed by fast low-angle shot (FLASH) perfusion-sensitive scans. Diffusion-weighted images showed clear ischemic lesions in the affected basal ganglia and cortex. Ischemic deficits were demonstrated as a decrease in first-pass transit of injected boluses of gadodiamide. ADC maps were generated and regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained to span the range of ADC reductions from the lesion center or core to the periphery or penumbra. Corresponding ROIs from the bolus injection images were used to calculate perfusion indexes relative to contralateral levels as ratios of Delta R(2)* integrals and ratios of Delta R(2)* peak values. In all animals, the degree of ADC reductions was related to the degree of Delta R(2)* perfusion deficits, ranging from severe ischemia in the core of the lesion to intermediate and moderate changes toward the lesion periphery. In the ischemic periphery, ADC reductions were linearly correlated with Delta R(2)* peak ratios. However, no significant correlation was found between ADC reductions and Delta R(2)* integral ratios. These data suggest that magnetic resonance measurements of ADC and Delta R(2)* peak ratios can be used to quantitatively assess the variable gradients in focal ischemia, including potentiallyn critical areas at risk in the ischemic periphery.

N2  -  Objective To determine if histograms of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) can be used to differentiate paediatric brain tumours.
Methods Imaging of histologically confirmed tumours with pre-operative ADC maps were reviewed (54 cases, 32 male, mean age 6.1 years; range 0.1-15.8 years) comprising 6 groups. Whole tumour ADC histograms were calculated; normalised for volume. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to differentiate tumour types using histogram metrics, initially for all groups and then for specific subsets.; Results All 6 groups (5 dysembryoplastic neuroectodermal tumours, 22 primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET), 5 ependymomas, 7 choroid plexus papillomas, 4 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours (ATRT) and 9 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA)) were compared. 74% (4054) were correctly classified using logistic regression of ADC histogram parameters. In the analysis of posterior fossa tumours, 80% of ependymomas, 100% of astrocytomas and 94% of PNET-medulloblastoma were classified correctly. All PNETs were discriminated from ATRTs (22 PNET and 4 supratentorial ATRTs) (100%).; Conclusions ADC histograms are useful in differentiating paediatric brain tumours, in particular, the common posterior fossa tumours of childhood. PNETs were differentiated from supratentorial ATRTs, in all cases, which has important implications in terms of clinical management.; Key Points; MR based apparent diffusion coefficient histograms can help differentiate paediatric brain tumours; ADC histogram parameters correctly classified the great majority of posterior fossa tumours.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) could be used as measures of cell density and necrotic fraction of tumors. Tumors of four human melanoma xenograft fines were subjected to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). ADCs were calculated from the images and related to cell density and necrotic fraction, as determined from histological sections. A significant correlation was found between the ADC of the viable tissue and cell density, regardless of whether tumors of different lines or different regions within individual tumors were considered. Necrosis was found in two of the lines. A single region of massive necrosis that could be differentiated from the viable tissue in ADC maps was found in one line, whereas a number of smaller necrotic regions that could not be identified in ADC maps were found in the other line. Tumor ADC was significantly correlated with the necrotic fraction of the former, but not of the latter line. Our results suggest that ADCs can be used as measures of cell density and necrotic fraction of some but not of all tumors, depending on whether the individual necrotic regions are large enough to be differentiated from the viable tissue with the obtained spatial resolution of the DW images.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Contrast enhancement in a brain tumor on magnetic resonance imaging is typically indicative of a high-grade glioma. However, a significant proportion of nonenhancing gliomas can be either grade II or III. While gross total resection remains the primary goal, imaging biomarkers may guide management when surgery is not possible, especially for nonenhancing gliomas. The utility of diffusion tensor imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated in differentiating nonenhancing gliomas.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on imaging data from 72 nonenhancing gliomas, including grade II (n = 49) and III (n = 23) gliomas. Diffusion tensor imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast data were used to generate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity as well as cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and mean transit time maps. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression and area under the curve analyses were used to measure sensitivity and specificity of imaging parameters. A sub-analysis was performed to evaluate the utility of imaging parameters in differentiating between different histologic groups.; RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis indicated that tumor volume and relative mean transit time could differentiate between grade II and III nonenhancing gliomas. At a cutoff value of 0.33, this combination provided an area under the curve of 0.71, 70.6% sensitivity, and 64.3% specificity. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated much higher sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation of astrocytomas from oligodendrogliomas or identification of grades within these histologic subtypes.; CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging and dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging can aid in differentiation of nonenhancing grade II and III gliomas and between histologic subtypes.

N2  -  Cerebral gliomas are the most common primary brain neoplasms in adults and represent one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the general population. Prognosis and decisions on management depend on the histological type and grade of the lesion 1.2. Histopathological analysis is the "gold standard" in formulating the diagnosis of type and grade, but requires an open or stereotactic biopsy, a procedure which carries an appreciable risk of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of various biopsy procedures depends on the amount of tissue obtained and the accurate targeting of areas of high diagnostic yield. Diagnostic pitfalls are the intrinsic heterogeneity of cerebral tumors and the frequent coexistence of small foci of high grade transformation 2 in the background of a largely low grade lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CT scanning if MRT is not available or contraindicated, is the method of choice for the preoperative evaluation of cerebral gliomas, but has limited sensitivity and specificity in the definition of tumor type and grade, and sometimes can provide ambiguous or misleading information(1). This may be attributable to the difficulty in discriminating between tumor and edema or nonspecific treatment effects, and to the existence of gadolinium-enhanced necrosis, which may be mistaken for tumor, or high grade tumor that do not enhance. These problems may be overcome by the development of imaging modalities that highlight structural, functional and/or metabolic properties of the tumor. Positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography may be valid candidates for such analysis(3,4), but there would be considerable savings in cost and patient discomfort if similar information could be defined using an MR methodology. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI) is a noninvasive technique that provides metabolic information within tissues. Brain gliomas generally have increased choline (Cho) and decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and variable levels of creatine (Cr), while the presence of lactate and/or lipids (LL) usually indicates necrosis. Several studies have demonstrated that H-1-MRSI can be used to guide surgical resection or biopsies, define radiotherapy planning and monitor treatment effects or progression to higher grade(5). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a MR technique that is sensitive to the molecular motion of water, thereby providing information on the structural features of biological tissues. The diffusion parameter called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can play a role in the evaluation of tumors and post-therapy monitoring, giving information that has been linked to cellularity and structural integrity(6,7). However, data regarding the distinction between different tumor types and grades, or between tumor infiltration and vasogenic edema(6,8,9) are somewhat conflicting. Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), using an exogenous endovascular tracer such as gadopentetate dimeglumine, provides information on the hemodynamics of tumor tissue. The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), a widely used PWI parameter, strictly reflects the tumor microvasculature and angiogenesis, and is useful in grading cerebral gliomas. rCBV maps can guide stereotactic biopsy and monitor response to therapy(10).
In recent years, several authors have used a combination of 1H-MRSI, DWI andor PWI in addition to conventional MRI to enhance its ability to differentiate solid tumor from othr intratumoral or peritumoral components(11-12), radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor(13), stable from progressing tumors(14), and among tumor types andor grades (11,12,15). All the above MR techniques have been performed mainly at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 Tesla.

N2  -  Introduction: Although ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury varies between cortical and subcortical regions, its effects on specific regions remain unclear. In this study, we used various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of I/R injury within the salvaged ischemic penumbra (IP) and reperfused ischemic core (IC) of a rodent model, with the aim of enhancing therapeutic strategies by elucidating these dynamics. Materials and methods: A total of 17 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 1 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion with a suture model. MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), T2-weighted imaging, perfusionweighted imaging, and T1 mapping, was conducted at multiple time points for up to 5 days during the I/R phases. The spatiotemporal dynamics of blood-brain barrier (BBB) modifications were characterized through changes in T1 within the IP and IC regions and compared with mean diffusivity (MD), T2, and cerebral blood flow. Results: During the I/R phases, the MD of the IC initially decreased, normalized after recanalization, decreased again at 24 h, and peaked on day 5. By contrast, the IP remained relatively stable. Both the IP and IC exhibited hyperperfusion, with the IP reaching its peak at 24 h, followed by resolution, whereas hyperperfusion was maintained in the IC until day 5. Despite hyperperfusion, the IP maintained an intact BBB, whereas the IC experienced persistent BBB leakage. At 24 h, the IC exhibited an increase in the T2 signal, corresponding to regions exhibiting BBB disruption at 5 days. Conclusions: Hyperperfusion and BBB impairment have distinct patterns in the IP and IC. Quantitative T1 mapping may serve as a supplementary tool for the early detection of malignant hyperemia accompanied by BBB leakage, aiding in precise interventions after recanalization. These findings underscore the value of MRI markers in monitoring ischemia-specific regions and customizing therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.

N2  -  Brain tumor surgery requires a delicate tradeoff between complete removal of neoplastic tissue while minimizing loss of brain function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have emerged as valuable tools for non-invasive assessment of human brain function and are now used to determine brain regions that should be spared to prevent functional impairment after surgery. However, image analysis requires different software packages, mainly developed for research purposes and often difficult to use in a clinical setting, preventing large-scale diffusion of presurgical mapping. We developed a specialized software able to implement an automatic analysis of multimodal MRI presurgical mapping in a single application and to transfer the results to the neuronavigator. Moreover, the imaging results are integrated in a commercially available wearable device using an optimized mixed-reality approach, automatically anchoring 3-dimensional holograms obtained from MRI with the physical head of the patient. This will allow the surgeon to virtually explore deeper tissue layers highlighting critical brain structures that need to be preserved, while retaining the natural oculo-manual coordination. The enhanced ergonomics of this procedure will significantly improve accuracy and safety of the surgery, with large expected benefits for health care systems and related industrial investors.

N2  -  Background. - Carotid artery stenosis is associated with the occurrence of acute and chronic ischemic lesions that increase with age in the elderly population. Diffusion Imaging and ADC mapping may be an appropriate method to investigate patients with chronic hypoperfusion consecutive to carotid stenosis. This non-invasive technique allows to investigate brain integrity and structure, in particular hypoperfusion induced by carotid stenosis diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a carotid stenosis on the parenchyma using ADC mapping.
Methods. - Fifty-nine patients with symptomatic (33) and asymptomatic (26) carotid stenosis were recruited from our multidisciplinary consultation. Both groups demonstrated a similar degree of stenosis. All patients underwent MRI of the brain including diffusion-weighted MR imaging with ADC mapping. Regions of interest were defined in the anterior and posterior paraventricular regions both ipsilateral and contralateral to the stenosis (anterior circulation). The same analysis was performed for the thalamic and occipital regions (posterior circulation).; Results. - ADC values of the affected vascular territory were significantly higher on the side of the stenosis in the periventricular anterior (P < 0.001) and posterior (P < 0.01) area. There was no difference between ipsilateral and contralateral ADC values in the thalamic and occipital regions.; Conclusions. - We have shown that carotid stenosis is associated with significantly higher ADC values in the anterior circulation, probably reflecting an impact of chronic hypoperfusion on the brain parenchyma in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This is consistent with previous data in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Reaction-diffusion models have been proposed for decades to capture the growth of gliomas. Nevertheless, these models require an initial condition: the tumor cell density distribution over the whole brain at diagnosis time. Several works have proposed to relate this distribution to abnormalities visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we verify these hypotheses by stereotactic histological analysis of a non-operated brain with glioblastoma using a 3D-printed slicer. Cell density maps are computed from histological slides using a deep learning approach. The density maps are then registered to a postmortem MR image and related to an MR-derived geodesic distance map to the tumor core. The relation between the edema outlines visible on T2-FLAIR MRI and the distance to the core is also investigated. Our results suggest that (i) the previously proposed exponential decrease of the tumor cell density with the distance to the core is reasonable but (ii) the edema outlines would not correspond to a cell density iso-contour and (iii) the suggested tumor cell density at these outlines is likely overestimated. These findings highlight the limitations of conventional MRI to derive glioma cell density maps and the need for other initialization methods for reaction-diffusion models to be used in clinical practice.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been employed in many brain pathologies, but with few studies only and heterogeneous results in herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in comparison to DWI yields additional directional diffusion data, adding information and enabling a more differentiated description of brain pathologies. The authors addressed the question whether tissue changes as identified on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be further characterized by DTI, in particular whether different forms of edema may occur in HSVE. Six patients with HSVE confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were studied. Patients were examined with MRI including DTI in the early stage of the infection. Conventional MRI- and DTI-derived parameter maps were analyzed for signal change qualitatively and by region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the affected brain parenchyma. All patients showed typical clinical characteristics of HSVE and lesions in the mediobasal temporal structures and insula. In two cases hemorrhagic inflammatory tissue changes were found. DTI analysis showed slightly reduced mean diflusivity (MD) and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the earliest phase. Patients scanned at day 14 or later had lesions with increased MD and reduced FA in accordance with inflammatory vasogenic edema. This study confirms signal change consistent with the presence of inflammatory vasogenic edema in HSVE as the most prominent DTI finding. In the early stage slight reductions of MD may be found, which might be due to a specific mechanism of viral infection.

N2  -  Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, well known as classical homocystinuria, is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of homocysteine and sulfur metabolism. CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine. The clinical features of untreated CBS deficiency include myopia, ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies resembling Mar-fan syndrome, and thromboembolic events. Cerebral white matter lesions (CWMLs), identified in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are related to various clinical conditions including ischemia, inflammation, demyelination, infection, a tumor, and metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria. The presence of CWMLs is, however, believed to be a very rare condition in CBS-deficient patients. Herein, we report reversible CWMLs associated with hypermethioninemia caused by poor protein restriction and betaine therapy in a 21-year-old male with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency. T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffuse high signal intensity in subcortical areas extending to the deep white matter. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed high signal intensity, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map demonstrated decreased ADC value in the lesions. The course of improvement after correct methionine restriction was successively followed by brain MRI. The CWMLs had regressed at 1 month after restriction, and disappeared after 5 months. ADC values were very low before proper methionine restriction, but normalized after 2 months. Use of betaine in the presence of elevated plasma methionine may increase the risk of reversible CWMLs in some CBS-deficient patients.

N2  -  Poststroke hyperglycemia is associated with a poor outcome yet clinical management is inadequately informed. We sought to determine whether clinically relevant levels of hyperglycemia exert detrimental effects on the early evolution of focal ischemic brain damage, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, in normal rats and in those modeling the 'metabolic syndrome'. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) or fructose-fed spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (ffSHRSP) rats were randomly allocated to groups for glucose or vehicle administration before permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Diffusion-weighted imaging was carried out over the first 4 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion and lesion volume calculated from apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Infarct volume and immunostaining for markers of oxidative stress were measured in the fixed brain sections at 24 hours. Hyperglycemia rapidly exacerbated early ischemic damage in both WKY and ffSHRSP rats but increased infarct volume only in WKY rats. There was only limited evidence of oxidative stress in hyperglycemic animals. Acute hyperglycemia, at clinically relevant levels, exacerbates early ischemic damage in both normal and metabolic syndrome rats. Management of hyperglycemia may have greatest benefit when performed in the acute phase after stroke in the absence or presence of comorbidities.

N2  -  The purpose of our study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy via multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in orthotopic mouse brain tumor models. Stereotactic-guided intracranial inoculation of MDA-MB-231 cells was performed in nude mice. Thirty tumor bearing mice were randomized into three groups, and each group received either IA docetaxel administration (n = 10), intravenous (IV) docetaxel administration (n = 10), or IA solvent injection (n = 10) as control. Treatment response was monitored by diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI obtained 1 day before and 8 days after therapy initiation. Imaging results were correlated with histopathology. In the results, IA chemotherapy showed a significant decrease in tumor volume (86.5 +/- A 15.6 %) compared to the IV chemotherapy (121.1 +/- A 39.6 %) and control (126.2 +/- A 22.0 %) 8 days after therapy (p < 0.05). Furthermore, IA chemotherapy resulted in a significant increase in mean tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (116.8 +/- A 44.9 %); in contrary IV chemotherapy (66.6 +/- A 26.9 %) and control (69.1 +/- A 29.5 %) showed a significant decrease in ADC values corresponding to further tumor growth (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in perfusion parameters including initial area under the curve, K-trans, K-ep, and V-e between the groups (p > 0.05). Histopathology confirmed necrosis and necroptosis in the tumors after IA chemotherapy. In conclusion, IA chemotherapy may lead to effective inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and offer potential benefit of inducing higher degree of treatment response than IV chemotherapy.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Improving the accuracy of brain tumour radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning is important to optimise patient outcomes. This systematic review investigates primary studies providing clinical evidence for the integration of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) biomarkers and MRI radiomics to optimise brain tumour RT planning. Materials and methods: PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched for all years until June 21, 2022. The search identified original articles demonstrating clinical evidence for the use of qMRI biomarkers and MRI radiomics for the optimization of brain cancer RT planning. Relevant information was extracted and tabulated, including qMRI metrics and techniques, impact on RT plan optimization and changes in target and normal tissue contouring and dose distribution. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were grouped according to the qMRI biomarkers into: 1) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI; five studies); 2) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; seven studies); and 3) MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI; seven studies). No relevant MRI-based radiomics studies were identified. Integration of DTI maps offers the potential for improved organs at risk (OAR) sparing. MRSI metabolic maps are a promising technique for improving delineation accuracy in terms of heterogeneity and infiltration, with OAR sparing. No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the integration of DWI metrics and PWI maps. Conclusions: Integration of qMRI metrics into RT planning offers the potential to improve delineation and OAR sparing. Clinical trials and consensus guidelines are required to demonstrate the clinical benefits of such approaches.

T2  -  CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING REVIEWS

N2  -  Soon after the invention of intraoperative MR imaging in 1997, various applications have been presented. Besides being an early resection control, intraoperative MRI was used to update neuro-navigation and replace frame based stereotactic systems. Recently, advanced MR imaging techniques (including MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), and dynamic susceptibility weighted MR imaging (DSC-MRI)) were introduced, applied in an intraoperative environment. Feasibility and clinical applications have previously been presented. This review summarizes all these advanced techniques and discusses advantages and disadvantages during the resection of a lesion using intraoperative MRI.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-To characterize the spatial pattern of cerebral ischemic vulnerability to hypoperfusion in stroke patients.
Methods-We included 90 patients who underwent admission CT perfusion and MRI within 12 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Infarcted brain lesions ("core") were segmented from admission diffusion-weighted imaging and, along with the CT perfusion parameter maps, coregistered onto MNI-152 brain space, which was parcellated into 125 mirror cortical and subcortical regions per hemisphere. We tested the hypothesis that the percent infarction increment per unit of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) reduction differs statistically between regions using regression analysis to assess the interaction between regional rCBF and region variables. Next, for each patient, a "vulnerability index" map was constructed with voxel values equaling the product of that voxel's rCBF and infarction probability (derived from the MNI-152-transformed, binary, segmented, diffusion-weighted imaging lesions). Voxel-based rCBF threshold for core was determined within the upper 20(th) percentile of vulnerability index map voxel values.; Results-Different regions had different percent infarction increase per unit rCBF reduction (P=0.001). The caudate body, putamen, insular ribbon, paracentral lobule, and precentral, middle, and inferior frontal gyri had the highest ischemic vulnerability to hypoperfusion. A voxel-based rCBF threshold of <0.42 optimally distinguished infarct core in the highly-vulnerable regions, whereas rCBF <0.16 distinguished core in the remainder of the brain.; Conclusions-We demonstrated regional ischemic vulnerability of the brain to hypoperfusion in acute stroke patients. Location-specific, rather than whole-brain, rCBF thresholds may provide a more accurate metric for estimating infarct core using CT perfusion maps. (Stroke. 2011;42:1255-1260.)

N2  -  Background and Purpose. A pattern of decreased intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps is useful in the early detection of ischemic brain injury. Less information exists with regard to patients with acute neurologic deficits in whom there is abnormal conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increased ADC intensity. Methods. The authors identified 13 patients with acute neurologic deficits who underwent diffusion MRI and had calculated ADC maps demonstrating hyperintensity in regions characterized by computed tomography hypodensity and MRI T2 hyperintensity. The initial and follow-up imaging characteristics and clinical syndromes were recorded. Results. Clinical syndromes included hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy, hyperperfusion following carotid endarterectomy, venous sinus thrombosis, HIV encephalopathy, and brain tumor. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was hyperintense in 3 of 13 patients, isointense in 4 of 13 patients, heterogeneous in 3 of 13 patients, and hypointense in 3 of 13 patients. The ADC values in these regions were significantly higher than those in control regions (P < .0001). At early follow-up, MRI abnormalities resolved completely in 3 of 13 patients and partially in 9 of 13 patients. MRI abnormalities were unchanged in 1 patient. Conclusions. In the evaluation of patients with acute neurologic deficits, ADC hyperintensity may identify a subset of patients with vasogenic edema of nonischemic etiology. Frequently, these conditions are potentially reversible if appropriately managed. DWI and conventional images alone are not sufficient to identify these neurologic conditions.

N2  -  Pediatric hepatobiliary imaging is important for evaluation of not only congenital or structural disease but also metabolic or diffuse parenchymal disease and tumors. A variety of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can be used for these assessments. In ultrasonography, conventional ultrasound imaging as well as vascular imaging, elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can be used, white in MRI, fat quantification, T2/T2* mapping, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance elastography, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can be performed. These techniques may be helpful for evaluation of biliary atresia, hepatic fibrosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and hepatic masses in children. In this review, we discuss each tool in the context of management of hepatobiliary disease in children, and cover various imaging techniques in the context of the relevant physics and their clinical. applications for patient care.

N2  -  Background The human white matter pathway network is complex and of critical importance for functionality. Thus, learning and understanding white matter tract anatomy is important for the training of neuroscientists and neurosurgeons. The study aims to test and evaluate a new method for fiber dissection using augmented reality (AR) in a group which is experienced in cadaver white matter dissection courses and in vivo tractography. Methods Fifteen neurosurgeons, neurolinguists, and neuroscientists participated in this questionnaire-based study. We presented five cases of patients with left-sided perisylvian gliomas who underwent awake craniotomy. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) was performed and the language-related networks were visualized separated in different tracts by color. Participants were able to virtually dissect the prepared DTI FTs using a spatial computer and AR goggles. The application was evaluated through a questionnaire with answers from 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum). Results Participants rated the overall experience of AR fiber dissection with a median of 8 points (mean +/- standard deviation 8.5 +/- 1.4). Usefulness for fiber dissection courses and education in general was rated with 8 (8.3 +/- 1.4) and 8 (8.1 +/- 1.5) points, respectively. Educational value was expected to be high for several target audiences (student: median 9, 8.6 +/- 1.4; resident: 9, 8.5 +/- 1.8; surgeon: 9, 8.2 +/- 2.4; scientist: 8.5, 8.0 +/- 2.4). Even clinical application of AR fiber dissection was expected to be of value with a median of 7 points (7.0 +/- 2.5). Conclusion The present evaluation of this first application of AR for fiber dissection shows a throughout positive evaluation for educational purposes.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intraoperative displacement of major white matter tracts during glioma resection by comparing preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking.
METHODS: In 37 patients undergoing glioma surgery, preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions. For three-dimensional tractography, we implemented a knowledge-based multiple-region-of-interest approach applying user-defined seed regions in the color-coded maps of fractional anisotropy. Tracking was initiated in both the retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the principal eigenvector in each voxel of the region of interest. The tractography results were also assigned color, applying the convention used in color-coded fractional anisotropy maps.; RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking was technically feasible in all patients. Fiber tract visualization gave a quick and intuitive overview of the displaced course of white matter tracts in three-dimensional space. Comparison of preoperative and intraoperative tractography depicted a marked shifting of major white matter tracts during glioma removal. Maximum white matter tract shifting ranged from -8 to +15 mm (+2.7 -6.0 mm; mean +- standard deviation); in 29.7%, an inward and in 62.2%, an outward shifting was detected.; CONCLUSION: Comparing preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking visualizes a marked shifting and deformation of major white matter tracts because of tumor removal. This shifting emphasizes the need for an intraoperative update of navigation systems during resection of deep-seated tumor portions near eloquent brain areas. Fiber tracking is a method not only for preoperative neurosurgical visualization but also for further intraoperative planning.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the features of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in cortical tubers and white-matter lesions in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Materials and methods: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were performed in 14 patients with clinically established TS. Based on these DT images, ADC and FA maps were generated. The ADC values in 32 cortical tubers, and the ADC and FA values in 18 white-matter lesions were measured and compared with those of the corresponding contralateral regions.; Results: Compared with the corresponding contralateral regions, cortical tubers of TS patients had significantly higher ADC values (P<0.001); white-matter lesions had significantly higher ADC values (P<0.001) and significantly lower FA values (P<0.001).; Conclusion: DTI is a useful tool for demonstrating changes in cortical tubers and white-matter lesions resulting from TS.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Maximal safe resection is the goal of modem surgical treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) located close to the motor cortex (M1) and/or the corticospinal tract (CST). Preoperative planning based on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and fluorescence-guided resection (FGR) using sodium-fluorescein have been separately described to increase the extent of resection (EOR) while preserving the motor pathway. We assessed the efficacy of the combination of these techniques for surgery of motor-eloquent HGGs.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with motor-eloquent HGGs operated at the Departments of Neurosurgery of the University of Messina, Italy. and of the Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany, between 2016 and 2019. All patients underwent nTMS mapping of M1, and nTMS-based DTI tractography of CST. Tumor resection was guided by intraoperative neurophysiological mapping (IONM) supported by sodium-fluorescein fluorescence and by intraoperative visualization of the nTMS-based information through neuronavigation. EOR and new permanent motor deficits were compared with a historical control group of patients operated exclusively with IONM guidance.; RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled, while 55 patients were included as controls. The gross total resection (GTR) rate was significantly higher in patients operated using nTMS + FGR compared with controls (64.5% vs. 47.2%, P=0.04). As well, postoperative new permanent motor deficits were reduced in the study group vs. controls (11.4% vs. 20%).; CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the combination of sodium-fluorescein FOR with nTMS-based planning improved surgical treatment of motor-eloquent HGGs. It represents a valuable support to IONM-guided resection, increasing the GTR rate while reducing the occurrence of permanent motor deficits.

N2  -  Aim of this study was to determine the spectrum and prevalence of pathological intracranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with acute bacterial meningitis.
We retrospectively identified all consecutive patients with cerebral spinal fluid proven bacterial meningitis who presented at our neurology department between 2007 and 2012. Pathogenic agents and clinical symptoms were noted. MR-examinations were evaluated regarding presence and localization of pathological signal alterations in the different sequences by two neuroradiologists in consensus.; A total of 136 patients with purulent bacterial meningitis were identified. In 114 cases the bacterial pathogen agent was proven and in 75 patients an MRI was available. In 62 of the 75 (82.7 %) patients meningitis-associated pathologic imaging findings were evident on MRI. Overall, intraventricular signal alterations, i.e., signs of pyogenic ventriculitis, were present in 41 cases (54.7 %), while sulcal signal changes were found in 22 cases (29.3 %). Intraparenchymatous signal alterations affected the cortex in 15 cases (20 %), and the white matter in 20 patients (26.7 %). The diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences were most sensitive in the detection of these changes and showed any pathologic findings in 67.6 and 79.6 %, respectively. Patients with streptococcal meningitis showed significantly more often (n = 29 of 34, 85.3 %) intraventricular andor sulcal diffusion restrictions than patients with meningitis caused by other agents (n = 12 of 37, 32.4 %) (p < 0.0001).; Pathological MR findings are frequently found in patients with acute bacterial meningitis. Intraventricular diffusion restrictions, i.e., signs of pyogenic ventriculitis, are more often found in patients with streptococcal, especially pneumococcal, infection.

N2  -  The ultimate goal of any cancer therapy is to target the elimination of neoplastic cells. Although newer therapeutic strategies are in constant development, therapeutic assessment has been hampered by the inability to assess, rapidly and quantitatively, efficacy in vivo. Diffusion imaging and, more recently, sodium MRI have demonstrated their distinct abilities to detect therapy-induced alterations in tumor cellularity, which has been demonstrated to be indicative of therapeutic efficacy. More importantly, both imaging modalities detect tumor response much earlier than traditional methodologies that rely on macroscopic volumetric changes. In this study, the correlation between tumor sodium and diffusion was further tested to demonstrate the sensitivity of sodium imaging to gauge tumor response to therapy by using a 9L rat gliosarcoma treated with varying doses of BCNU [1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea]. This orthotopic model has been demonstrated to display variability in response to BCNU therapy where initial insult has been shown to lead to drug-resistance. In brief, a single 26.6 mg/kg BCNU dose yielded dramatic responses in both diffusion and sodium MRI. However, a second equivalent BCNU dose yielded a much smaller change in diffusion and sodium, suggesting a drop in tumor sensitivity to BCNU. The MRI responses of animals treated with 13.3 mg/kg BCNU were much lower and similar responses were observed after the initial and secondary applications of BCNU. Furthermore, these results were further validated using volumetric measurements of the tumor and also ex vivo determination of tumor sensitivity to BCNU. Overall, these experiments demonstrate the sensitivity and applicability of sodium and diffusion MRI as tools for dynamic assessment of tumor response to therapy.

N2  -  Background White matter change is a well-known abnormality in congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection, but grading remains challenging and clinical relevance unclear.Objective To investigate if quantitative measurement of white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neonatal brain can predict outcome in cCMV.Materials and methods A retrospective, single-center observational study, including patients with cCMV who had a neonatal brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging, was performed between 2007 and 2020. Regions of interest were systematically placed in the white matter on the ADC maps. Two pediatric radiologists independently scored additional brain abnormalities. Outcome measures were neonatal hearing and cognitive and motor development. Statistical analysis included simple and penalized elastic net regression.Results Neonatal brain MRI was evaluated in 255 patients (median age 21 days, 25-75 percentiles: 14-28 days, 121 male). Gyral abnormalities were noted in nine patients (3.5%), ventriculomegaly in 24 (9.4%), and subependymal cysts in 58 (22.7%). General white matter ADC was significantly higher in patients with neonatal hearing loss and cognitive and motor impairment (P< 0.05). For neonatal hearing loss, simple logistic regression using only general white matter was the best prediction model, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC)=0.76. For cognitive impairment, interacting elastic net regression, including other brain abnormalities and frontoparietal white matter ADC, performed best, with AUC=0.89. For motor impairment, interacting elastic net regression, including other brain abnormalities and deep anterior frontal white matter performed best, with AUC=0.73.Conclusion Neonatal white matter ADC was significantly higher in patients with clinical impairments. Quantitative ADC measurement may be a useful tool for predicting clinical outcome in cCMV.

N2  -  White matter (WM) injury and survival after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has received insufficient attention. WM disruption surrounding the hematoma has been documented in animal models with histology, but rarely in human ICH with noninvasive means, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A few human MRI studies have investigated changes in long WM tracts after ICH remote from the hematoma, like the corticospinal tract, but have not attempted to obtain an unbiased quantification of WM changes within and around the hematoma over time. This study attempts such quantification from 3 to 30 days post ictus. Thirteen patients with mild to moderate ICH underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI at 3, 14, and 30 days. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were used to calculate the volume of tissue with FA > 0.5, both within the hematoma (lesion) and in the perilesional tissue. At day 3, the percentages of both lesional and perilesional tissue with an FA > 0.5 were significantly less than contralateral, unaffected, anatomically identical tissue. This perilesional contralateral difference persisted at day 14, but there was no significant difference at day 30. The loss of perilesional tissue with FA > 0.5 increased with increasing hematoma size at day 3 and day 14. All patients had some tissue within the lesion with FA > 0.5 at all time points. This did not decrease with duration after ictus, suggesting the persistence of white matter within the hematoma/lesion. These results outline an approach to quantify WM injury, both within and surrounding the hematoma, after mild to moderate ICH using DTI MRI. This may be important for monitoring treatment strategies, such as hematoma evacuation, and assessing efficacy noninvasively.

N2  -  Diffusion- and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study the putative effects of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphism in stroke. Thirty-one patients with acute stroke, comparative for age and gender were scanned, nine of whom were ApoE allele epsilon4 carriers. Initially, less than 24 hours from the onset of stroke, the epsilon4 carriers had significantly smaller volumes of hypoperfusion on relative cerebral blood volume map (P = 0.001), and smaller infarct volumes (P = 0.008) compared with the noncarriers. By day 8, this difference in the infarct volumes had disappeared, suggesting relatively enhanced infarct growth. On average, the total infarct volume increased 145% of the initial infarct volume in the epsilon4 carriers, and 84% in the noncarriers. There were strong correlations between the imaging findings and clinical status initially and with the outcome 3 months after the stroke in the epsilon4 noncarriers, but, with a single exception at acute phase, a lack thereof in the epsilon4 carriers. These patterns were virtually similar in a subgroup of patients with middle cerebral artery stroke. These data support the hypothesis of increased general vulnerability of the brain in the e4 carriers. Thus, the effects of ApoE polymorphism should be accounted for when interpreting diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI studies, particularly if predicting lesion growth.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of obtaining magnetic resonance-measured cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (MR-CMRO2) in acute ischemic stroke patients. Seven stroke patients were serially imaged: 4.5 +/- 0.9 hours (tp1), 3 to 5 days (tp2), and I to 3 months (tp3) after symptom onset. Diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and multiecho gradient-echo/spin-echo images were acquired; cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction maps were obtained from which CMRO2 was calculated as the product of cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction. The final infarct lesions obtained from tp3 T2-weighted images and the "penumbra" obtained from the tp1 perfusion-weighted image-defined lesion were coregistered onto tp1 CMRO2 maps. CMRO2 values in the region of brain that eventually infarcted were reduced to 0.40 +/- 0.24 of the respective region on the contralateral hemisphere. The "salvaged penumbra" defined by the area of mismatch between the final infarct and the tp1 perfusion-weighted lesion demonstrated an average CMRO2 value of 0.55 +/- 0.11 of the contralateral hemisphere. Although our results are preliminary and require further evaluation, the ability to obtain in vivo measurements of MR-CMRO2 noninvasively potentially can provide information for determining brain tissue viability in acute ischemic stroke patients.

N2  -  According to the US Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common form of head injury. Medical imaging data provides clinical insight into tissue damage/injury and injury severity, and helps medical diagnosis. Computational modeling and simulation can predict the biomechanical characteristics of such injury, and are useful for development of protective equipment. Integration of techniques from computational biomechanics with medical data assessment modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging or MRI) has not yet been used to predict injury, support early medical diagnosis, or assess effectiveness of personal protective equipment. This paper presents a methodology to map computational simulations with clinical data for interpreting blunt impact TBI utilizing two clinically different head injury case studies. MRI modalities, such as T1, T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), were used for simulation comparisons. The two clinical cases have been reconstructed using finite element analysis to predict head biomechanics based on medical reports documented by a clinician. The findings are mapped to simulation results using image-based clinical analyses of head impact injuries, and modalities that could capture simulation results have been identified. In case 1, the MRI results showed lesions in the brain with skull indentation, while case 2 had lesions in both coup and contrecoup sides with no skull deformation. Simulation data analyses show that different biomechanical measures and thresholds are needed to explain different blunt impact injury modalities; specifically, strain rate threshold corresponds well with brain injury with skull indentation, while minimum pressure threshold corresponds well with coup-contrecoup injury; and DWI has been found to be the most appropriate modality for MRI data interpretation. As the findings from these two cases are substantiated with additional clinical studies, this methodology can be broadly applied as a tool to support injury assessment in head trauma events and to improve countermeasures (e.g., diagnostics and protective equipment design) to mitigate these injuries.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the quantitative DTI parameters of the CST in patients suffering from subcortical gliomas affecting the CST using generally available navigation software.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 22 subjects with diagnosis of primary cerebral glioma and preoperative motor deficits. Exclusion criteria were: involvement of motor cortex, lesion involving both hemispheres, previous surgical treatment. All patients were studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. Volume, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity value (MD) of the entire CSTs were estimated. Moreover, distance from midline, diameters, FA and MD were calculated on axial images at the point of minimal distance between tumor and CST. Statistical analysis was performed.; Results: There was a statistically significant difference of CST volume between affected and non-affected hemispheres (p<0.01). Mean overalllocal FA, overalllocal MD and sagittal diameter of CST were also significantly different between the two sides (p<0.05). Correlation tests resulted positive between the shift of CST and overalllocal MD. Moreover there is significance between CST volume of tumor hemisphere and preoperative duration of motor deficits (p<0.05).; Conclusion: The present study has demonstrated for the first time a significant difference of DTI based quantitative parameters of the CST between a tumor affected and a non-affected hemisphere in patients with a corresponding motor deficit. This preliminary data suggests a correlation between DTI based integrity of CST and its function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background Intracranial cavernous malformations (CMs), commonly known as cavernomas or cavernous angiomas, are low-flow, well-circumscribed vascular lesions composed of sinusoidal spaces lined by a single layer of endothelium and separated by a collagenous matrix without elastin, smooth muscle, or other vascular wall elements. A diameter greater than 3 cm for a CM is unlikely. These lesions may have atypical appearances on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI with advanced techniques such as a susceptibility-weighted image or T2-gradient echo, a diffusion-weighted image and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient map, and diffusion tensor tractography have revolutionized the diagnostic approach to these lesions. Materials and Method The present study reviews the etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, MRI strategy, and MRI appearances of the CMs, with a few examples of the giant CMs from our archive. Results Intracranial giant CMs may have unexpected locations, sizes, numbers, and varied imaging appearances due to repeated hemorrhages, unusual enhancement patterns, intense perifocal edema, and unusual associations, making the differential diagnosis difficult. Conclusion Familiarity with the MRI appearances of the giant intracranial CMs and the differential diagnosis improves diagnostic accuracy and patient management.

N2  -  Proteolytic disruption of the extracellular matrix with opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) because of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) occurs in reperfusion injury after stroke. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition blocks the early disruption of the BBB, but the long-term consequences of short-term MMP inhibition are not known. Recently, a method to quantify BBB permeability by graphical methods was described, which provides a way to study both early disruption of the BBB and long-term effects on recovery in the same animal. We used a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB1101, to determine both the usefulness of the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for treatment studies and the long-term effects on recovery. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed in control (N = 6) and drug-treated (N = 8) groups on a dedicated 4.7-T MRI scanner. Adult Wistar-Kyoto underwent a 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by an MRI study after 3 h of reperfusion, which consisted of T2- and diffusion-weighted techniques. Additionally, a rapid T1 mapping protocol was also implemented to acquire one pre-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid baseline data set followed by postinjection data sets at 3-min intervals for 45 mins. The same animal was imaged again at 48 h for lesion size estimation. Data was postprocessed pixel-wise to generate apparent diffusion coefficient and permeability coefficient maps. Treatment with BB1101 significantly reduced BBB permeability at 3 h, but failed to reduce lesion size at 48 h. Behavioral studies showed impairment in recovery in treated rats. Magnetic resonance imaging allowed for the monitoring of multiple parameters in the same animal. Our studies showed that BB-1101 was an excellent inhibitor of the BBB damage. However, results show that BB-1101 may be responsible for significant deterioration in neurologic status of treated animals. Although these preliminary results suggest that BB-1101 is useful in reducing early BBB leakage owing to reperfusion injury in stroke, further studies will be needed to determine whether the later detrimental effects can be eliminated by shorter time course of drug delivery.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To determine if water diffusivity within lymphomas and high-grade astrocytomas correlates with cellularity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in 11 patients with brain lymphomas (19 lesions) and in 17 patients with astrocytomas (19 lesions) were retrospectively reviewed. Regions of interest were drawn on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in enhancing tumor. ADC values were normalized by dividing ADC values of tumors by those of normal-appearing regions and expressing the quotient as a ratio. Histologic samples from 11 patients with astrocytomas (11 lesions) and seven patients with lymphoma (seven lesions) were reviewed. Cellularity was measured by calculating the percentage of nuclear area and the percentage of cytoplasmic area and expressing the results as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (NC) ratio. The ADC and NC ratios of both tumor types were compared by using a two-tailed t test.; RESULTS: Mean ADC ratio of lymphomas was 1.15 (SD, 0.33; standard error of the mean SEMI, 0.10), and that of high-grade astrocytomas was 1.68 (SD, 0.48; SEM, 0.11) (P <.01). Mean NC ratio of lymphoma was 1.45 (SD, 0.94; SEM, 0.36), and that of high-grade astrocytomas was 0.24 (SD, 0.18; SEM, 0,05) (P <.01).; CONCLUSION: Measurements of water diffusivity and cellularity suggest that higher cellularity contributes to more restricted diffusion.

N2  -  Oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE) sequences provide access to short diffusion times and may provide insight into micro-scale internal structures of pathologic lesions based on an analysis of changes in diffusivity with differing diffusion times. We hypothesized that changes in diffusivity acquired with a shorter diffusion time may permit elucidation of properties related to the internal structure of extra-axial brain tumors. This study aimed to investigate the utility of changes in diffusivity between short and long diffusion times for characterizing extra -axial brain tumors. In total, 12 patients with meningothelial meningiomas, 13 patients with acoustic neu-romas, and 11 patients with pituitary adenomas were scanned with a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using OGSE and pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) (effective diffusion times [Aeff]: 6.5 ms and 35.2 ms) with b-values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2. Relative percentage changes between shorter and longer diffusion times were calculated using region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of brain tu-mors on A1, A2, A3, and mean diffusivity (MD) maps. The diffusivities of PGSE, OGSE, and relative percentage changes were compared among each tumor type using a multiple comparisons Steel-Dwass test. The mean (standard deviation) MD at Aeff of 6.5 ms was 1.07 +/- 0.23 10-3 mm2/s, 1.19 +/- 0.18 10-3 mm2/s, 1.19 +/- 0.21 10-3 mm2/s for meningothelial meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, and pituitary adenomas, respectively. The mean (standard deviation) MD at Aeff of 35.2 ms was 0.93 +/- 0.22 10-3 mm2/s, 1.07 +/- 0.19 10-3 mm2/s, 0.82 +/- 0.21 10-3 mm2/s for meningothelial meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, and pituitary adenomas, respectively. The mean (standard deviation) of the relative percentage change was 15.7 +/- 4.4%, 12.4 +/- 8.2%, 46.8 +/- 11.3% for meningothelial meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, and pituitary adenomas, respectively. Compared to me-ningiomas and acoustic neuromas, pituitary adenoma exhibited stronger diffusion time-dependence with diffu-sion times between 6.5 ms and 35.2 ms (P < 0.05). In conclusion, differences in diffusion time-dependence may be attributed to differences in the internal structures of brain tumors. DWI with a short diffusion time may provide additional information on the microstructure of each tumor and contribute to tumor diagnosis.

N2  -  MRI is the standard modality to assess anatomy and response to treatment in brain and spine tumors given its superb anatomic soft tissue contrast (e.g., T1 and T2) and numerous additional intrinsic contrast mechanisms that can be used to investigate physiology (e.g., diffusion, perfusion, spectroscopy). As such, hybrid MRI and radiotherapy (RT) devices hold unique promise for Magnetic Resonance guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT). In the brain, MRgRT provides daily visualizations of evolving tumors that are not seen with cone beam CT guidance and cannot be fully characterized with occasional standalone MRI scans. Significant evolving anatomic changes during radiotherapy can be observed in patients with glioblastoma during the 6-week fractionated MRIgRT course. In this review, a case of rapidly changing symptomatic tumor is demonstrated for possible therapy adaptation. For stereotactic body RT of the spine, MRgRT acquires clear isotropic images of tumor in relation to spinal cord, cerebral spinal fluid, and nearby moving organs at risk such as bowel. This visualization allows for setup reassurance and the possibility of adaptive radiotherapy based on anatomy in difficult cases. A review of the literature for MR relaxometry, diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopy during RT is also presented. These techniques are known to correlate with physiologic changes in the tumor such as cellularity, necrosis, and metabolism, and serve as early biomarkers of chemotherapy and RT response correlating with patient survival. While physiologic tumor investigations during RT have been limited by the feasibility and cost of obtaining frequent standalone MRIs, MRIgRT systems have enabled daily and widespread physiologic measurements. We demonstrate an example case of a poorly responding tumor on the 0.35 T MRIgRT system with relaxometry and diffusion measured several times per week. Future studies must elucidate which changes in MR-based physiologic metrics and at which timepoints best predict patient outcomes. This will lead to early treatment intensification for tumors identified to have the worst physiologic responses during RT in efforts to improve glioblastoma survival.

N2  -  Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a well-known demyelinating disease to cause cognitive dysfunction. The limbic system, relevant to memory, can be easily overlooked in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Purpose To investigate the distribution and frequency of demyelinating lesions affecting white matter connections of the limbic system based on localization with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) color maps compared to three-dimensional T2-weighted (T2W) and FLAIR volumes in MS patients.; Material and Methods One hundred and fifty patients with a known diagnosis of MS were identified for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA)-compliant retrospective cross-sectional study. DTI-derived FA color maps, co-registered to T2W and FLAIR images, were analyzed for lesions affecting the three white matter tracts of the limbic system including cingulum, fornix, and mammilothalamic tracts by two investigators. The approximate location of the lesions on FLAIR was always confirmed on the co-registered DTI-derived FA color maps.; Results Of the 150 patients analyzed, 14.6% had cingulum lesions, 2.6% had fornix lesions, and 2.6% had mammilothalamic tract lesions; 21.3% of patients had at least one of the three tracts affected.; Conclusion A relatively high frequency of lesions involving the limbic tracts may explain memory deficits and emotional dysfunction commonly experienced by patients with MS. The combined information from T2W, FLAIR, and DTI-derived FA color map allowed for more accurate localization of lesions affecting the major white matter tracts of the limbic system.

N2  -  Patients with functionally eloquent brain lesions are at risk of functional decline in the course of resection. Given tumor-related plastic reshaping and reallocation of function, individual data are needed for patient counseling and risk assessment prior to surgery. This study evaluates the utility of mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for individual risk evaluation of surgery-related decline of motor or language function in the clinical setting. In total, 250 preoperative nTMS mappings (100 language and 150 motor mappings) derived from 216 patients (mean age: 57.0 +/- 15.5 years, 58.8% males; glioma World Health Organization (WHO) grade I & II: 4.2%, glioma WHO grade III & IV: 83.4%, arteriovenous malformations: 1.9%, cavernoma: 2.3%, metastasis: 8.2%) were included. Deterministic tractography based on nTMS motor or language maps as seed regions was performed with 25%, 50%, and 75% of the individual fractional anisotropy threshold (FAT). Lesion-to-tract distances (LTDs) were measured between the tumor mass and the corticospinal tract (CST), arcuate fascicle (AF), or other closest language-related tracts. LTDs were compared between patients and correlated to the functional status (no/transient/permanent surgery-related paresis or aphasia). Significant differences were found between patients with no or transient surgery-related deficits and patients with permanent surgery-related deficits regarding LTDs in relation to the CST (p < 0.0001), AF (p <less than or equal to> 0.0491), or other closest language-related tracts (p <= 0.0435). The cut-off values for surgery-related paresis or aphasia were <= 12 mm (LTD-CST) and <= 16 mm (LTD-AF) or <= 25 mm (LTD-other closest language-related tract), respectively. Moreover, there were significant associations between the status of surgery-related deficits and the LTD when considering the CST (range r: -0.3994 to -0.3910, p < 0.0001) or AF (range r: -0.2918 to -0.2592, p = 0.0135 and p = 0.0473 for 25% and 50% FAT). In conclusion, this is the largest study evaluating the application of both preoperative functional mapping and function-based tractography for motor and language function for risk stratification in patients with functionally eloquent tumors. The LTD may qualify as a viable marker that can be seamlessly assessed in the clinical neurooncological setup.

N2  -  Although the addition of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) to standard-dose radiation (60 Gy) improves survival, the pattern of failure continues to be local. Conventional contrast enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for radiation planning reflect anatomic rather than molecular or functional, properties of the tumor. Functional and metabolic MRI and positron emission tomography are able to detect metabolic and functional abnormalities beyond the tumor volume seen on conventional MRI, assess early response to treatment, and delineate the regions of high risks for failure in high-grade gliomas. This article focuses on the potential of these functional and metabolic imaging techniques to refine our clinical target volumes. Semin Radiat Oncol 19:155-162 (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  This study presents a method for computing a probabilistic atlas that describes the spatial distributions of acute infarcts of the brain. The data consisted of diffusion-weighted-images (DWI) and high-resolution T1-weighted MR images representing 22 studies from 22 subjects. All DWI data sets contained high-intensity lesions on B-1000 maps, known from clinical history to be related to acute stroke. To compute the atlas, manually segmented infarcts on original DWI were spatially transformed and registered to a common coordinate system. This coordinate system allowed combining all lesions into a statistical atlas in the model space. As a result, the computed probabilistic map showed mild left-sided predominance of brain infarcts, which likely represents asymmetry in eloquence of brain regions. In our opinion, the statistical atlas of acute brain infarcts can facilitate computer-based detection of stroke in large image data sets.

N2  -  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multi-organ involvement and results in neurological and psychiatric (NP) symptoms in up to 40% of the patients. To date, the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) poses a challenge due to the lack of neuroradiological gold standards. In this study, we aimed to better localize and characterize normal appearing white matter (NAWM) changes in NPSLE by combining data from two quantitative MRI techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI). 9 active NPSLE patients (37 +/- 13 years, all females), 9 SLE patients without NP symptoms (44 +/- 11 years, all females), and 14 healthy controls (HC) (40 +/- 9 years, all females) were included in the study. MTI, DTI and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were collected from all subjects on a 3 T MRI scanner. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) maps and white matter lesion maps based on the FLAIR images were created for each subject. MTR and DTI data were then co-analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and a cumulative lesion map to exclude lesions. Significantly lower MTR and FA and significantly higher AD, RD and MD were found in NPSLE compared to HC in NAWM regions. The differences in DTI measures and in MTR, however, were only moderately co-localized. Additionally, significant differences in DTI measures, but not in MTR, were found between NPSLE and SLE patients, suggesting that the underlying microstructural changes detected by MD are linked to the onset of NPSLE. The co-analysis of the anatomical distribution of MTI and DTI measures can potentially improve the diagnosis of NPSLE and contribute to the understanding of the underlying microstructural damage.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine the potential of using a computer-aided detection method to intelligently distinguish peritumoral edema alone from peritumor edema consisting of tumor using a combination of high-resolution morphological and physiological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques available on most clinical MRI scanners.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study consisted of patients with two types of primary brain tumors: meningiomas (n = 7) and glioblastomas (n = 11). Meningiomas are typically benign and have a clear delineation of tumor and edema. Glioblastomas are known to invade outside the contrast-enhancing area. Four classifiers of differing designs were trained using morphological, diffusion-weighted, and perfusion-weighted features derived from MRI to discriminate tumor and edema, tested on edematous regions surrounding tumors, and assessed for their ability to detect nonenhancing tumor invasion.; Results: The four classifiers provided similar measures of accuracy when applied to the training and testing data. Each classifier was able to identify areas of nonenhancing tumor invasion supported with adjunct images or follow-up studies.; Conclusion: The combination of features derived from morphological and physiological imaging techniques contains the information necessary for computer-aided detection of tumor invasion and allows for the identification of tumor invasion not previously visualized on morphological, diffusion-weighted, and perfusion-weighted images and maps. Further validation of this approach requires obtaining spatially coregistered tissue samples in a study with a larger sample size.

N2  -  Background: Although magnetic resonance imaging, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging, has increasingly been used as part of a multimodal approach to prognostication in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, the performance of quantitative analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, as compared to standard radiologist impression, has not been well characterized. This retrospective study evaluated quantitative ADC analysis to the identification of anoxic brain injury by diffusion abnormalities on standard clinical magnetic resonance imaging reports. Methods: The cohort included 204 previously described comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Clinical outcome was assessed by (1) 3-6 month post-cardiac-arrest cerebral performance category and (2) coma recovery to following commands. Radiological evaluation was obtained from clinical reports and characterized as diffuse, cortex only, deep gray matter structures only, or no anoxic injury. Quantitative analyses of ADC maps were obtained in specific regions of interest (ROIs), whole cortex, and whole brain. A subgroup analysis of 172 was performed after eliminating images with artifacts and preexisting lesions. Results: Radiological assessment outperformed quantitative assessment over all evaluated regions (area under the curve [AUC] 0.80 for radiological interpretation and 0.70 for the occipital region, the best performing ROI, p = 0.011); agreement was substantial for all regions. Radiological assessment still outperformed quantitative analysis in the subgroup analysis, though by smaller margins and with substantial to near-perfect agreement. When assessing for coma recovery only, the difference was no longer significant (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.81 for the occipital region, p = 0.70). Conclusions: Although quantitative analysis eliminates interrater differences in the interpretation of abnormal diffusion imaging and avoids bias from other prediction modalities, clinical radiologist interpretation has a higher predictive value for outcome. Agreement between radiological and quantitative analysis improved when using high-quality scans and when assessing for coma recovery using following commands. Quantitative assessment may thus be more subject to variability in both clinical management and scan quality than radiological assessment.

N2  -  Differentiation of cerebral tumor pathology currently relies on interpretation of conventional structural MRI and in some cases histology. However, more advanced MRI methods may provide further insight into the organization of cerebral tumors and have the potential to aid diagnosis. The objective of this study was to use multimodal quantitative MRI to measure the imaging signatures of meningioma and low-grade glioma (LGG). Nine adults with meningioma and 11 with LGG were identified, and underwent standard structural, quantitative longitudinal relaxation time (T-1) mapping, magnetization transfer and diffusion tensor MRI. Maps of mean (< D >), axial (lambda(AX)) and radial (lambda(RAD)) diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and T-1 were generated on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Using structural and echo-planar T-2-weighted MRI, manual region-of-interest segmentation of brain tumor, edema, ipsilateral and contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) was performed. Differences in imaging signatures between the different tissue types, both absolute mean values and ratios relative to contralateral NAWM, were assessed using t-tests with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. For both absolute mean values and ratios relative to contralateral NAWM, there were significant differences in (D), lambda(AX), lambda(RAD), FA, MTR and T-1 between meningioma and LGG tumor tissue, respectively. Only T-1 and FA differed significantly between edematous tissue associated with the two tumor types. These results suggest that multimodal MRI biomarkers are significantly different, particularly in tumor tissue, between meningioma and LGG. By using quantitative multimodal MRI it may be possible to identify tumor pathology non-invasively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Locating the pyramidal tract (PT) is difficult in patients with thalamic or basal ganglia tumors, especially when the surrounding anatomical structures cannot be identified using computed tomography or magnetic resonance images. Hence, we objected to find a way to predict the location of the PT in patients with thalamic and basal ganglia tumors
MethodologyPrincipal Findings: In 59 patents with thalamic or basal ganglia tumors, the PTs were constructed by with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber tracking (FT). In axial slices crossing the foramen of Monro, the tumor position was classified according to three lines. Line 1 was vertical and crossed the vertex point of the anterior limbs of the internal capsule. Lines 2 and line 3 were horizontal and crossed the foramen of Monro and joint of the middle and lateral thirds of the posterior limbs, respectively. Six (10.17%) patients were diagnosed with type 1 tumor, six (10.17%) with type 2, seven (11.86%) with type 3a, five (8.47%) with type 3b, 17 (28.81%) with type 4a, six (10.17%) with type 4b, three (5.08%) with type 5, and nine (15.25%) with type 6. In type 1 tumors, the PTs were located at the 12 o'clock position of the tumor, type 2 at six o'clock, type 3a between nine and 12 o'clock, type 3 between six and nine o'clock, type 4a between 12 and three o'clock, type 4b at three o'clock, type 5 between six and nine o'clock, and type 6 between three and six o'clock.; ConclusionsSignificance: The position of the PT relative to the tumor could be determined according to the tumor location. These results could prove helpful in determining the location of the PT preoperatively.

N2  -  PURPOSE:  To correlate the findings on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images with the cytologic and histologic findings in ischemic tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A photochemical model of cerebral infarction in rats was studied with diffusion- and T2-weighted MR imaging. The development of lesions was followed from 20 minutes to 5 days after the onset of ischemia. Apparent water diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated and correlated with light and electron microscopic findings.; RESULTS: T2-weighted images clearly showed vasogenic edema but did not enable distinction between areas with cellular damage and the surrounding edematous regions. In contrast, the ADC, which was elevated in nonischemic edematous regions, was diminished in areas with histologic evidence of ischemic damage or necrosis. In the core of the infarct, the ADC became elevated when electron microscopy revealed cellular lysis.; CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted images may help ascertain the extent of cellular damage and death after stroke.

N2  -  Diffusion MRI measures of the human brain provide key insight into microstructural variations across individuals and into the impact of central nervous system diseases and disorders. One approach to extract information from diffusion signals has been to use biologically relevant analytical models to link millimetre scale diffusion MRI measures with microscale influences. The other approach has been to represent diffusion as an anomalous transport process and infer microstructural information from the different anomalous diffusion equation parameters. In this study, we investigated how parameters of various anomalous diffusion models vary with age in the human brain white matter, particularly focusing on the corpus callosum. We first unified several established anomalous diffusion models (the super-diffusion, sub-diffusion, quasi-diffusion and fractional Bloch-Torrey models) under the continuous time random walk modelling framework. This unification allows a consistent parameter fitting strategy to be applied from which meaningful model parameter comparisons can be made. We then provided a novel way to derive the diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) model, which is shown to be a degree two approximation of the sub-diffusion model. This link between the DKI and sub-diffusion models led to a new robust technique for generating maps of kurtosis and diffusivity using the sub-diffusion parameters beta(SUB) and D-SUB. Superior tissue contrast is achieved in kurtosis maps based on the sub-diffusion model. 7T diffusion weighted MRI data for 65 healthy participants in the age range 19-78 years was used in this study. Results revealed that anomalous diffusion model parameters a and beta have shown consistent positive correlation with age in the corpus callosum, indicating a and beta are sensitive to tissue microstructural changes in ageing.

N2  -  Thrombolysis of embolic stroke in the rat was measured using diffusion (DWI)-, T-2 (T2WI)-, and perfusion (PWI)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An embolus was placed at the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by injection of an autologous single blood clot via an intraluminal catheter placed in the intracranial segment of internal carotid artery. Rats were treated with a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) 1 hour after embolization (n = 9) or were not treated (n = 15). Diffusion-weighted imaging, T2WI, and PWI were performed before, during, and after embolization from 1 hour to 7 days. After embolization in both rt-PA-treated and control animals, the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC(w)) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic region significantly declined from the preischemic control values (P < 0.001). However, mean CBF and ADC(w) in the rt-PA-treated group was elevated early after administration of rt-PA compared with the untreated control group, and significant differences between the two groups were detected in CBF (24 hours after embolization, P < 0.05) and ADC(w) (3, 4, and 24 hours after embolization, P < 0.05). T-2 values maximized at 24 (control group, P < 0.001) or 48 hours (treated group, P < 0.01) after embolization. The increase in T-2 in the control group was significantly higher at 24 hours and 168 hours than in the rt-PA-treated group (P < 0.05). Significant correlations (r greater than or equal to 0.80, P < 0.05) were found between lesion volume measured 1 week after embolization and CBF and ADC(w) obtained 1 hour after injection of rt-PA. Within a coronal section of brain, MRI cluster analysis, which combines ADC(w) and T-2 data maps, indicated a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the lesion 24 hours after thrombolysis compared with nontreated animals. These data demonstrate that the values for CBF and ADC(w) obtained I hour after injection of rt-PA correlate with histologic outcome in the tissue, and that the beneficial effect of thrombolysis of an intracranial embolus by means of rt-PA is reflected in an increase of CBF and ADC(w), a reduction in the increase of T-2, and a reduction of the ischemic lesion size measured using MRI cluster analysis.

N2  -  Some in vitro experiments have shown that erythropoietin (EPO) increases resistance to apoptosis and facilitates neuronal survival following cerebral ischemia. However, results from in vivo studies are rarely reported. Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been applied successfully to distinguish acute cerebral ischemic necrosis and penumbra in living animals; therefore, we hypothesized that PWI and DWI could be used to provide imaging evidence in vivo for the conclusion that EPO could reduce apoptosis in brain areas injured by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. To validate this hypothesis, we established a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and treated with intra-cerebroventricular injection of EPO (5,000 U/kg) 20 minutes before injury. Brain tissue in the ischemic injury zone was sampled using MRI-guided localization. The relative area of abnormal tissue, changes in PWI and DWI in the ischemic injury zone, and the number of apoptotic cells based on TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) were assessed. Our findings demonstrate that EPO reduces the relative area of abnormally high signal in PWI and DWI, increases cerebral blood volume, and decreases the number of apoptotic cells positive for TUNEL in the area injured by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The experiment provides imaging evidence in vivo for EPO treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate whether indices of diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) are altered after contrast medium injection in patients with brain tumors.
DT-MRIs at a 3-T unit before and 6 min after gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid injection were obtained in nine patients (five women, four men) with histologically confirmed brain tumors (four metastases, one glioblastoma multiforme, three meningiomas, and one lymphoma). Fractional anisotropy (FA), trace and mean raw DT-MRI data without (DT_b0, b value = 0 smm(2)) and with (DT_b800, b value = 800 smm(2)) diffusion-encoded gradients were calculated. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the tumor, peritumoral edema, and normal-appearing symmetric contralateral brain tissue for each patient. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to determine the effects of contrast medium and ROI for all of the maps, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for either paired t test between pre- and post-contrast values of DTI indices for the ROIs or the post hoc test.; Statistically significant differences between pre-contrast and post-contrast DT-MRI are shown in the trace value of the peritumoral edema area (p = 0.0195) and the FA value of the tumor area (p = 0.0273). Trace and FA values of the other areas show no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-contrast (p > 0.05). In addition, we find a significant ROI effect for both FA (chi (2) = 26.514, df = 2, p = 0.0001) and trace (chi (2) = 21.218, df = 2, p = 0.0001).; DT-MRI obtained after contrast medium injection of 6 min results in significant changes in diffusion isotropic and anisotropic values. Therefore, clinical applications of DT-MRI after administrating a contrast medium require caution in interpretation.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine if diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be used as a surrogate marker of tumor response to anticancer therapy in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas.
Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including echo-planar DWI sequences was performed prospectively in 23 consecutive patients with soft-tissue sarcomas before and after initiation of regional or systemic chemotherapy. The mean interval between initial and follow-up MRI was 56.9 +- 23.2 days. Tumor volumes were determined by manual segmentation of tumor borders on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated from corresponding sections of ADC maps on initial and follow-up DWI. Subsequently, changes in tumor volumes and ADC were correlated using the Pearson correlation coefficient.; Results: A high degree of correlation was found when changes in tumor volumes and ADC values were compared (r = -0. 925, P < 0.0001), regardless of the effectiveness of anticancer therapy expressed as changes of tumor volume.; Conclusion: DWI can be used as a supplement to morphologic imaging for the evaluation of tumor response to anticancer therapy in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. As cellular changes are expected to precede morphologic changes in treated tumors, DWI performed at an early stage of fractionated therapy may provide unique prognostic information of its effectiveness.

N2  -  Purpose
Bevacizumab-related imaging abnormality (BRIA), appearing as areas of restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and representing atypical coagulative necrosis pathologically, has been observed in patients with brain tumors receiving radiotherapy and bevacizumab. We investigated the role of cumulative radiation dose in BRIA development in a voxel-wise analysis.; Methods; Patients (n = 18) with BRIA were identified. All had high-grade gliomas or brain metastases treated with radiotherapy and bevacizumab. Areas of BRIA were segmented semi-automatically on diffusion-weighted MRI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images. To avoid confounding by possible tumor, hypoperfusion was confirmed with perfusion imaging. ADC images and radiation dose maps were co-registered to a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI and registration accuracy was verified. Voxel-wise normal tissue complication probability analyses were performed using a logistic model analyzing the relationship between cumulative voxel equivalent total dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) and BRIA development at each voxel. Confidence intervals for regression model predictions were estimated with bootstrapping.; Results; Among 18 patients, 39 brain tumors were treated. Patients received a median of 4.5 cycles of bevacizumab and 1-4 radiation courses prior to BRIA appearance. Most (64%) treated tumors overlapped with areas of BRIA. The median proportion of each BRIA region of interest volume overlapping with tumor was 98%. We found a dose-dependent association between cumulative voxel EQD2 and the relative probability of BRIA (beta(0) = -5.1, beta(1) = 0.03 Gy(-1), gamma = 1.3).; Conclusions; BRIA is likely a radiation dose-dependent phenomenon in patients with brain tumors receiving bevacizumab and radiotherapy. The combination of radiation effects and tumor microenvironmental factors in potentiating BRIA in this population should be further investigated.

N2  -  Congenital medulloblastoma is extremely rare. MRI appearance of this tumor in the fetal brain has not been described. A case of congenital medulloblastoma initially observed by antenatal MRI with postnatal follow-up and treatment is presented. A pregnant female underwent fetal MRI on the 31st gestational week for routine indications. Midline cerebellar lesion of <= 2 cm in size with minor T-2 hypointensity and T-1 hyperintensity was identified. Additionally, quantitative MRI including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fast macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping was performed. The lesion showed a marked ADC decrease and MPF increase. MPF maps depicted the lesion most conspicuously. After term delivery, a male neonate presented with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Postnatal MRI identified obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a large posterior fossa mass. The child was treated by cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement. Follow-up quantitative MRI on the fifth month revealed tumor growth and vivid changes of its tissue contrast associated with brain maturation. The tumor appeared nearly isointense on T-1 - and T-2-weighted images and slightly hypointense on the ADC map. MPF contrast showed the most remarkable change from hyper- to hypointensity due to brain myelination with stable MPF in the tumor. Subsequently, the child underwent partial tumor resection, and currently continues treatment with chemotherapy. The pathological diagnosis was desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. The described case illustrates evolution of the tumor contrast in the course of fetal and postnatal brain development and highlights the added diagnostic value of MPF mapping in fetal and neonatal neuroimaging.

N2  -  AIM: To explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and wholelesion apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis of brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the differentiation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with brain metastases from NSCLC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were subtyped into EGFR mutation (23 cases) and wild-type (25 cases) groups. Whole-lesion histogram metrics were derived from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and imaging features were evaluated according to conventional MRI. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-squared test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to discriminate the two groups and to determine the diagnostic efficacy of ADC histogram parameters. RESULTS: EGFR mutation group had more multiple brain metastases, less peritumoural brain oedema (PTBO), and lower peritumoural brain oedema index (PTBO-I) than EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). In addition, 90th and 75th percentiles of ADC and maximum ADC in the EGFR mutation group were significantly higher than in the EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). Ninetieth percentile of ADC had the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.711), and it was found to outperform 75th percentile of ADC (AUC, 0.662; p1/40.039) and maximum ADC (AUC, 0.681). CONCLUSIONS: Whole-lesion ADC histogram analysis and MRI features of brain metastasis from NSCLC are expected to be potential biomarkers to non-invasively differentiate the EGFR mutation status.

N2  -  Background and purpose: STAT-1 is a member of a family of proteins called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and recent studies have shown its involvement in the induction of apoptosis. There is limited information on the role of STAT-1 following stroke. In this study we use MRI measurements of cerebral perfusion and bioenergetic status to target measurements of regional STAT-1 activity.
Methods: Rats were subjected to 60 or 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion with and without reperfusion. MRI maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water and cerebral blood flow were acquired throughout the study. After the ischemia or reperfusion period, the brain was excised and samples were analyzed by Western blots using anti-phospho-STAT1 and anti-Fas antibodies. Regions were selected for analysis according to their MRI characteristics.; Results: Transcriptional factor STAT-1 was enhanced in the lesion core and, to a lesser extent, in the lesion periphery, following ischemia and reperfusion. This level of activity was greater than for ischemia alone. Western blots demonstrated STAT-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 and not serine 727 after ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Enhanced expression of the apoptotic death receptor Fas was confirmed after ischemia followed by reperfusion.; Conclusions: This study demonstrates that focal ischemia of the rat brain can induce STAT-1 activation, particularly following a period of reperfusion. The activation occurs not only in the lesion core, but also in the lesion periphery, as identified using MRI. STAT-1 may play an important role in the induction of cell death following stroke.

N2  -  Background: Long-term survival and high-quality life of patients with gliomas depends on the extent of resection (EOR) and the protection of functional white matter fibers. The navigation system provides precise positioning for surgery based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but the precision decreases when intraoperative brain drift occurs. Ultrasound (US) can support real-time imaging and correct brain shift. The real-time US-MRI multimodal fusion virtual navigation system (UMNS) is a new technique for glioma surgery. In order to obtain a maximum EOR and functional protection, this study aimed to explore the feasibility, efficiency, and safety of real-time UMNS for glioma surgery, and to evaluate the benefit of the new application by UMNS presetting markers between the tumor and functional white matter fiber surgery.
Methods: A retrospective analysis included 45 patients who underwent glioma surgery, 19 patients with only intraoperative US, and 26 patients with UMNS. A preoperative plan was made by 3D-slicer software based on preoperative MRI. This was combined with a reconstruction of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that designed the important locations as "warning points" between functional white matter fibers and tumor. Following patient registration, markers were injected into preset "warning points" under image-guided UMNS in order to give us a warning during surgery in case of postoperative function deficits. The operating time, volumetric assessment in glioma resection, and postoperative complications were evaluated and used to compared those surgeries using intraoperative US (iUS) with those surgeries using intraoperate MRI (iMRI) navigation.; Results: A total of 45 patients underwent glioma surgery. Gross total removal (GTR) of iUS alone was achieved in 6 of 19 cases, while this was achieved in 22 of 26 cases with UMNS alone, demonstrating an improvement in rate of GTR from 31.58% to 84.62%, respectively. This may be attributable to the superior US image quality provided by UMNS. In 13 of 26 cases, there was improved image quality (from poormoderate to moderategood) with the aid of UMNS. In addition, the consistency of EOR of postoperative MRI evaluated by UMNS (92.31%) was higher than when using iUS alone (42.11%). The whole process of intraoperative scanning time and marker injection did not lead to a significant delay of the operating time compared to using iUS alone, and has been reported to be shorter than with iMRI as well. Furthermore, the percentage of postoperative morbidity in the UMNS group was lower than that in the iUS group (motor deficit: 11.54% vs. 42.11%; aphasia: P = 3.85% vs. 31.58%, respectively).; Conclusions: Real-time UMNS is an effective, timesaving technology that offers high quality intraoperative imaging. Injection markers between functional white matter fibers and tumor by UMNS can help to obtain a maximum EOR of glioma and functional protection postoperatively. The integration of iUS into the neuronavigation system offered quick and helpful intra-operative images.

N2  -  White matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and changes in adjacent normal-appearing white matter can disrupt computerized tract reconstruction and result in inaccurate measures of structural brain connectivity. The virtual lesion approach provides an alternative strategy for estimating structural connectivity changes due to WMH. To assess the impact of using young versus older subject diffusion MRI data for virtual lesion tractography, we leveraged recently available diffusion MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Lifespan database. Neuroimaging data from 50 healthy young (39.2 +/- 1.6 years) and 46 healthy older (74.2 +/- 2.5 years) subjects were obtained from the publicly available HCP-Aging database. Three WMH masks with low, moderate, and high lesion burdens were extracted from the WMH lesion frequency map of locally acquired FLAIR MRI data. Deterministic tractography was conducted to extract streamlines in 21 WM bundles with and without the WMH masks as regions of avoidance in both young and older cohorts. For intact tractography without virtual lesion masks, 7 out of 21 WM pathways showed a significantly lower number of streamlines in older subjects compared to young subjects. A decrease in streamline count with higher native lesion burden was found in corpus callosum, corticostriatal tract, and fornix pathways. Comparable percentages of affected streamlines were obtained in young and older groups with virtual lesion tractography using the three WMH lesion masks of increasing severity. We conclude that using normative diffusion MRI data from young subjects for virtual lesion tractography of WMH is, in most cases, preferable to using age-matched normative data.

N2  -  In order to more accurately asses variations in the apparent diffusion coefficient used for therapy evaluation, we have studied the variation in sulci density in the human brain. Sagittal, axial and coronal magnetic resonance imaging scans have been analyzed to determine the change of the coefficient of variance of pixel intensity as a function of position. In the sagittal direction, relative to the 50% most medial slices, we find an 11.0%+/- 4.8% (S.D.) decrease in the next 25% (12.5% on each side) of the slices. The most lateral 25% of the slices had less of a decrease and more variation: 7.0%+/- 12.2%. Similar variations were observed in axial and coronal scans. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Spinal cord infarctions occur rarely and are due to various aetiologies. In an emergency setting with acute spinal cord symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to exclude space-occupying lesions which require neurosurgical intervention. We report on two patients presenting with an anterior spinal artery syndrome caused by infarction of the thoracolumbar spinal cord including the conus medullaris. While T2-weighted images 4 h and 28 h after onset of clinical symptoms showed only slight unspecific signal changes, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed clear infarction and detected spinal cord ischaemia in an early stage, showing signal intensity conversion comparable to that in acute cerebral stroke.

N2  -  Background: Differentiating glioblastoma, brain metastasis, and central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can present a diagnostic dilemma due to the potential for overlapping imaging features. We investigate whether machine learning evaluation of multimodal MRI can reliably differentiate these entities.
Methods: Preoperative brain MRI including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion in patients with glioblastoma, lymphoma, or metastasis were retrospectively reviewed. Perfusion maps (rCBV, rCBF), permeability maps (K-trans, Kep, Vp, Ve), ADC, T1C+ and T2FLAIR images were coregistered and two separate volumes of interest (VOIs) were obtained from the enhancing tumor and non-enhancing T2 hyperintense (NET2) regions. The tumor volumes obtained from these VOIs were utilized for supervised training of support vector classifier (SVC) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. Validation of the trained models was performed on unlabeled cases using the leave-one-subject-out method. Head-to-head and multiclass models were created. Accuracies of the multiclass models were compared against two human interpreters reviewing conventional and diffusion-weighted MR images.; Results: Twenty-six patients enrolled with histopathologically-proven glioblastoma (n=9), metastasis (n=9), and CNS lymphoma (n=8) were included. The trained multiclass ML models discriminated the three pathologic dasses with a maximum accuracy of 69.2% accuracy (18 out of 26; kappa 0.540, P=0.01) using an MLP trained with the VpNET2 tumor volumes. Human readers achieved 65.4% (17 out of 26) and 80.8% (21 out of 26) accuracies, respectively. Using the MLP VpNET2 model as a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for cases in which the human reviewers disagreed with each other on the diagnosis resulted in correct diagnoses in 5 (19.2%) additional cases.; Conclusions: Our trained multiclass MLP using VpNET2 can differentiate glioblastoma, brain metastasis, and CNS lymphoma with modest diagnostic accuracy and provides approximately 19% increase in diagnostic yield when added to routine human interpretation.

N2  -  Several studies have shown that in tissues over an extended range of b-factors, the signal decay deviates significantly from the basic monoexponential model. The true nature of this departure has to date not been identified. For the current study, line scan diffusion images of brain suitable for biexponential diffusion tensor analysis were acquired in normal subjects on a clinical MR system. For each of six noncollinear directions, 32 images with b-factors ranging from 5 to 5000 s/mm(2) were collected. Biexponential fits yielded parameter maps for a fast and a slow diffusion component. A subset of the diffusion data, consisting of the images obtained at the conventional range of b-factors between 5 and 972 s/mm(2), was used for monoexponential diffusion tensor analysis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fast-diffusion component and the monoexponential fit exhibited no significant difference. FA of the slow-diffusion biexponential component was significantly higher, particularly in areas of lower fiber density. The principal diffusion directions for the two biexponential components and the monoexponential solution were largely the same and in agreement with known fiber tracts. The second and third, diffusion eigenvector directions also appeared to be aligned, but they exhibited significant deviations in localized areas. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Purpose: During the time window of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging experiments (DW-MRI), water diffusion in tissue appears to be anomalous as a transient effect, with a mean squared displacement that is not a linear function of time. A number of statistical models have been proposed to describe water diffusion in tissue, and parameters describing anomalous as well as Gaussian diffusion have previously been related to measures of tissue microstructure such as mean axon radius. We analysed the relationship between white matter tissue characteristics and parameters of existing statistical diffusion models.
Methods: A white matter tissue model (ActiveAx) was used to generate multiple b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging signals. The following models were evaluated to fit the diffusion signal: 1) Gaussian models - 1a) mono-exponential decay and 1b) bi-exponential decay; 2) Anomalous diffusion models - 2a) stretched exponential, 2b) continuous time random walk and 2c) space fractional Bloch-Torrey equation. We identified the best candidate model based on the relationship between the diffusion-derived parameters and mean axon radius and axial diffusivity, and applied it to the in vivo DW-MRI data acquired at 7.0 T from five healthy participants to estimate the same selected tissue characteristics. Differences between simulation parameters and fitted parameters were used to assess accuracy and in vivo findings were compared to previously reported observations.; Results: The space fractional Bloch-Torrey model was found to be the best candidate in characterising white matter on the base of the ActiveAx simulated DW-MRI data. Moreover, parameters of the space fractional Bloch-Torrey model were sensitive to mean axon radius and axial diffusivity and exhibited low noise sensitivity based on simulations. We also found spatial variations in the model parameter beta to reflect changes in mean axon radius across the mid-sagittal plane of the corpus callosum.; Conclusion: Simulations have been used to define how the parameters of the most common statistical magnetic resonance imaging diffusion models relate to axon radius and diffusivity. The space fractional Bloch-Torrey equation was identified as the best model for the characterisation of axon radius and diffusivity. This model allows changes in mean axon radius and diffusivity to be inferred from spatially resolved maps of model parameters.

N2  -  The growing exposure to chemicals in our environment and the increasing concern over their impact on health have elevated the need for new methods for surveying the detrimental effects of these compounds. Today's gold standard for assessing the effects of toxicants on the brain is based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology, sometimes accompanied by special stains or immunohistochemistry for neural processes and myelin. This approach is time-consuming and is usually limited to a fraction of the total brain volume. We demonstrate that magnetic resonance histology (MRH) can be used for quantitatively assessing the effects of central nervous system toxicants in rat models. We show that subtle and sparse changes to brain structure can be detected using magnetic resonance histology, and correspond to some of the locations in which lesions are found by traditional pathological examination. We report for the first time diffusion tensor image-based detection of changes in white matter regions, including fimbria and corpus callosum, in the brains of rats exposed to 8 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg trimethyltin. Besides detecting brain-wide changes, magnetic resonance histology provides a quantitative assessment of dose-dependent effects. These effects can be found in different magnetic resonance contrast mechanisms, providing multivariate biomarkers for the same spatial location. In this study, deformation-based morphometry detected areas where previous studies have detected cell loss, while voxel-wise analyses of diffusion tensor parameters revealed microstructural changes due to such things as cellular swelling, apoptosis, and inflammation. Magnetic resonance histology brings a valuable addition to pathology with the ability to generate brain-wide quantitative parametric maps for markers of toxic insults in the rodent brain.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted images of magnetic resonance imaging, obtained by mapping apparent diffusion coefficients, are more sensitive than other magnetic resonance imaging sequences in the earliest detection of acute cytotoxic injury. The usefulness of diffusion-weighted images in focal ischemic brain injury has been documented in children and adults. We report eight full-term neonates with global cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury and abnormalities on diffusion-weighted images. Distribution of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities in the eight neonates was consistent with global hypoxic-ischemic injury in full-term neonates, with diffuse cortical necrosis, border-zone infarcts, or basal ganglia/thalamic injury. Magnetic resonance imaging scans with diffusionweighted images were obtained within the first 4 days of age in all eight neonates. In each patient, standard magnetic resonance imaging sequences substantially underestimated the extent of injury when compared with diffusion-weighted images in unmyelinated neonatal brains. Extensive injury bilaterally with basal ganglia and thalamic and widespread multifocal cortical injury correlated with a severe neurologic outcome. Lesser degrees of injury, limited to smaller sectors of cortical or border zone involvement, were associated with better neurologic outcome. The high sensitivity of diffusion-weighted images to map the extent of hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonates makes it a potentially useful tool for assessing future neuroprotective strategies for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury.

N2  -  Object. Brain metastases occur in 10% to 40% of patients harboring cancer. In cases of neurosurgical metastasis resection, all postoperative neurological deterioration should be avoided. Reasons for postoperative deficits can be direct tissue damage due to resection, hemorrhage, venous congestive infarcts, or arterial ischemic events leading to tissue infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether postoperative ischemic infarctions occur in surgery for brain metastasis and to determine their influence on new postoperative neurological deficits.
Methods. Patients who underwent resection of brain metastases and had preoperative and early postoperative (within 48 hours) MRI scans, including diffusion-weighted imaging sequences and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, between January 2009 and May 2012 were included in this study. Clinical and histopathological data (histopathological results, pre- and postoperative neurological status, and previous tumor-specific therapy) were recorded.; Results. One hundred twenty-two patients (56 male, 66 female) who underwent resection of brain metastases were included.. The patients' mean age was 60 years (range 21-89 years). The mean time span from initial tumor diagnosis to resection of brain metastasis was 44 months (range 0-338 months). The mean preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status was 80% (exact mean 76% 17% SD), and the mean postoperative value was 80% (exact mean 78% 17%). Twelve (9.8%) of the 122 patients had postoperative permanent worsening of a neurological deficit or a new permanent neurological deficit; 44 (36.1%) of the 122 patients had postoperative ischemic lesions. When comparing patients with and without previous brain irradiation, 53.8% of patients with previous brain irradiation had ischemic lesions on postoperative imaging compared with 31.3% of patients without previous brain irradiation (p = 0.033). There was a significant association between ischemia and postoperative neurological status deterioration (transient or permanent); 13 (29.5%) of 44 patients with ischernic lesions had deterioration of their neurological status compared with 7 (9%) of the 78 patients who did not have ischemic lesions (p = 0.003).; Conclusions. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of vascular incidents in patients undergoing resection for metastatic brain disease. Patients harboring postoperative ischemic lesions detected by MRI have a higher rate of neurological deficits (transient or permanent). Patients who had previous irradiation therapy are at higher risk of developing postoperative ischemic lesions. A large number of postoperative neurological deficits are caused by ischemic incidents.

N2  -  Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disease affecting multiple systems. Brain is one of the most frequently involved organ and the standard intracranial hallmarks are cortical tuberous (CT), subependymal nodules (SEN) and giant cell astrocytoma (GCA). MRI findings are characteristic and are included among the diagnostic criteria set out by Roach.
Functional MR acquisitions such as proton spectroscopy (1HMRS), perfusion (ASL-PI) and diffusion (DWI and DTI) are additional tools to conventional imaging which allow a deeper understanding of "in vivo" physiology and pathology of the brain.; We have variably applied (HMRS)-H-1, ASL-PI and DWI- DTI in a series of patients with definite diagnosis of TSC. The aim was to assess the strength of these techniques in the clinical management of the most impaired patients, i.e. those with refractory epilepsy or with suspected GCA.; Combined brain MR studies were performed in 15 patients with definite diagnosis of TSC using a 1.5 T MR system (Signa Horizon LX, GE Medical System, Milwaukee, Wis) with a maximum gradient capability of 23 mTm and a slew rate of 120 Tms.; H-1 MRS was applied in 12 cortical tubers and one GCA. A short TE stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) technique (TR = 2010 ms, TE = 30 ms, mixing time = 13.7 ms, 128 scans, VOI dimension = 3.4 cc) was performed. Raw data were analysed off-line with the Spectral Analysis General ElectricInteractive Data Language (SAGEIDL). The following metabolites were evaluated: N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA, at 2.01 ppm), CreatinePhosphocreatine (Cr, at 3.05 ppm), Choline-containing compounds (Cho, at 3.25 ppm), Myo-Inositol (mI, at 3.56 ppm) and if detectable Lactate (Lac, at 1.33 ppm). Ratio of signal amplitude of each metabolite versus Cr signal was calculated. Results were compared to cortical 1HMRS data of 20 age-matched healthy subjects.; Multislice ASL-PI was used to measure CBF in 6 patients. CBF measurement was obtained using single-shot, GE-EPI images with FOV = 24 cm x 15 cm and acquisition matrix of 64 x 40, resulting in an inplane resolution of 3.75 mm. CBF values have been compared with those obtained in 46 healthy subjects (age ranging from 4 to 76 years).; DWI was performed in 5 patients, using an interleaved single-shot pulsed field gradient spin-echo sequence described by Stejskal and Tanner. The diffusion tensor (DTI) has been measured from seven MR images, the first one with bvalue = 0 and the other six with a bvalue = 1000 secmm(2) and diffusion gradient applied along the noncollinear directions (1,0,1), (-1,0,1), (0,1,1), (0,1,-1), (1,4,0), (-1,1,0). The diffusion weighted images (TR = 8000 ms, FOV = 24 cm x 24 cm, matrix = 128 x 128, slice thickness 5 mm) have been repeated four times to improve signal to noise ratio and processed by a Matlab 5.12 code to solve analytically D-ij values and to calculate the Trace, VR, FA and LI maps.; H-1 MRS acquired on CT presented a metabolic profile characterized by a marked increase of ml, a decrease of NAA and normal Cho. Lac was never detected. On the contrary the suspected GCA demonstrated Cho signal increase. In 4 patients ASL-PI demonstrated a marked CBF reduction in cortical regions corresponding with MRI-FLAIR confirmed locations of cortical tubers (15 divided by 28 ml100gmin). Three of these studies revealed also isolated cortical hyperperfusion (160 divided by198 ml100gmin) corresponding to normal MRI in two cases and to a small cortical dysplasia in one. All of these patients were epileptics. Global CBF was significantly reduced in two patients without any focal cortical flow abnormalities. Both patients were not affected by epilepsy and MRI demonstrated many small and scattered cortical lesions. Of little use turned out DWI and DTI, since TS lesions demonstrated similar diffusion values compared to other type of glial lesions. Among the techniques here evaluated, 1HMRS and ASL-PI have revealed interesting results for a deeper comprehension of TSC H-1 MRS increases the diagnostic confidence in those cases presenting solitary cortical-subcortical lesions and allows a non-invasive longitudinal evaluation of the potential biological transformation of SEN into GCA. CBF hypoperfusion in ASL-PI is in agreement with SPECT and PET studies of TSC, confirming therefore that cortical dysplasias are brain areas metabolically depressed and functionally inert. Focal cortical hyperperfusion detected in three cases could be related to epileptogenic foci. This hypothesis need to be further investigated by means of multimodality functional neuroimaging (MRI, ASL-PI, PET and EEG) in order to test the ASL-Pl capability of visualizing the epileptogenic laterality and of identification of the trigger epileptic foci.

N2  -  Purpose: To compare apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) with distributed diffusion coefficients (DDCs) in high-grade gliomas.
Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with high-grade gliomas prospectively underwent diffusion-weighted MRI. Traditional ADC maps were created using b-values of 0 and 1000 smm(2). In addition, DDC maps were created by applying the stretched-exponential model using b-values of 0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 smm(2). Whole-tumor ADCs and DDCs (in 10(-3) mm(2)s) were measured and analyzed with a paired t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the Bland-Altman method.; Results: Tumor ADCs (1.14 +- 0.26) were significantly lower (P = 0.0001) than DDCs (1.64 +- 0.71). Tumor ADCs and DDCs were strongly correlated (R = 0.9716: P < 0.0001), but mean bias +- limits of agreement between tumor ADCs and DDCs was -0.50 +- 0.90. There was a clear trend toward greater discordance between ADC and DDC at high ADC values.; Conclusion: Under the assumption that the stretched-exponential model provides a more accurate estimate of the average diffusion rate than the mono-exponential model, our results suggest that for a little diffusion attenuation the mono-exponential fit works rather well for quantifying diffusion in high-grade gliomas, whereas it works less well for a greater degree of diffusion attenuation.

N2  -  Advanced imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can provide more information than that regarding anatomy. These techniques have been commonly used in the clinical field and recently been shown useful in diagnosing brain tumors, especially in cases difficult to specify using conventional imaging. Differentiation requires more than attention to each advanced image. Diagnostic accuracy improves by combining information from MRS with that from other sequences, such as maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) generated from DTI and of cerebral blood volume (CBV) generated from PWI.
We show clinical applications of advanced imaging techniques, combined MRS, for brain tumor.

N2  -  Purpose was to adapt structural and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from humans to common marmoset monkeys on a clinical 3T scanner and to demonstrate the value for translational research.
Three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted MRI and gradient echo-based multi-parameter mapping was performed on nine adult animals using a wrist coil. Structural MRI was applied in a model of targeted experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Magnetization transfer (MT) and T1 parameter maps were used to depict axon-rich cortical areas. After intraveneous triple dose of gadobutrol, the excretion half-time was determined from consecutive measurements of R1 = 1T1. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed at 1 mm resolution.; At 0.4 mm resolution, total measurement time (30 min) was compatible with injection anesthesia, permitting rapid screening and frequent follow-up. Structural MRI depicted the EAE lesion in white matter. Quantitative values of T1, MT, and R2* in marmoset brain were comparable to humans, except for smaller R2* indicating lower iron content in basal ganglia. The middle temporal V5 area and the cortical layer IV could be identified, but were considerably better delineated when averaging two images at 0.33 mm resolution (70 min). A similar distribution volume (23%), but a shorter excretion half time than in humans (30 min) was observed. DTI was feasible only in larger structures, such as major axonal tracts.; High-resolution MRI of common marmosets proved feasible using clinical MRI hardware. A rapid 3D examination protocol was established for screening under injection anesthesia, thus avoiding the adverse effects of inhalation anesthesia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance imaging sequences such as diffusion and spectroscopy have been well studied in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, but no data exist on magnetic resonance perfusion imaging. Since inflammation is known to modulate the microcirculation, we investigated the hypothesis that changes in the local perfusion might be one of the earliest signs of lesion development. Twenty patients with different phenotypes of adrenoleukodystrophy and seven age-matched controls were evaluated between 2006 and 2011. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery, post-contrast T-1-weighted and normalized dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance perfusion cerebral blood volume maps were co-registered, segmented when cerebral lesion was present, and normalized cerebral blood volume values were analysed using a Food and Drug Association approved magnetic resonance perfusion software (NordicICE). Clinical and imaging data were reviewed to determine phenotype and status of progression. All eight patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy had an average 80% decrease in normalized cerebral blood volume at the core of the lesion (P < 0.0001). Beyond the leading edge of contrast enhancement cerebral perfusion varied, patients with progressive lesions showed an average 60% decrease in normalized cerebral blood volume (adults P < 0.05; children P < 0.001), while one child with arrested progression normalized cerebral blood volume in this region. In six of seven patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy lesions and follow-up imaging (2-24 month interval period), we found progression of contrast enhancement into the formerly hypoperfused perilesional zone. Asymptomatic, adrenomyeloneuropathy and female heterozygote patients had no significant changes in cerebral perfusion. Our data indicate that decreased brain magnetic resonance perfusion precedes leakage of the blood-brain barrier as demonstrated by contrast enhancement in cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and is an early sign of lesion progression.

N2  -  Retrospective assessment was performed of the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (minADC) together with quantitative assessment of the histopathological features of resected tumour tissue and the Ki-67 labelling index (LI) for predicting pineal parenchymal tumour (PPT) grade. Magnetic resonance images of tumours from 26 male and female patients (mean age 27.7 years) with pathologically confirmed PPTs, comprising 10 pineocytomas (PCs), seven pineal parenchymal tumours of intermediate differentiation (PPTIDs) and nine pineoblastomas (PBs), were reviewed retrospectively. Using ADC maps derived from isotropic diffusion-weighted images, the minADC value of each tumour was determined postoperatively from several regions of interest defined in the tumour, excluding cystic, necrotic, haemorrhagic or calcified components. Surgical intervention was undertaken in all cases. The Ki-67 LI was measured in surgical specimens. Mean minADC and Ki-67 LI showed significant differences among PCs, PPTIDs and PBs, and minADC was negatively correlated with Ki-67 LI. It is concluded that the minADC of PPTs provide useful additional information when predicting tumour grading.

N2  -  BOLD fMRI has, during the past decade, made a major transition from a purely research imaging technique to a viable clinical technique used primarily for presurgical planning in patients with brain tumors and other resectable brain lesions. This review article briefly examines the history and evolution of clinical functional imaging, with particular emphasis on how the use of BOLD fMR1 for neurosurgical planning has changed during the past 2 decades. Even more important, this article describes the many published studies during that same period that have examined the overall clinical impact that BOLD and DTI have made on surgical planning.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Gross total resection (GTR) of glioblastoma may be achieved with the aid of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (Io-MRI), which detects residual tumor during surgery, with the aim of maximizing resection, therefore reducing the risk of recurrence. Moreover, intraoperative fiber tracking and neuronavigated electrophysiologic cortical and subcortical mapping may help prevent postoperative deficits.
METHODS: There were 114 patients who underwent surgical removal of newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma between January 2009 and January 2013: 78 (group A) were operated on with the aid of Io-MRI, and 36 were operated on without Io-MRI (group B). The protocol included preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and Io-MRI with diffusion tensor imaging in all the cases that presented eloquent areas of involvement. The extent of resection (EOR) was compared in the 2 groups 24-72 hours after surgery.; RESULTS: The first Io-MRI detected a GTR in 31 patients (39.7%) and a residual tumor in 47 patients (60.3%) in group A. Twenty-one patients had residual tumor within eloquent areas: Io-MRI with fiber tracking permitted further resection, achieving GTR in 12 patients. GTR was radiologically detected in the remaining 26 patients (33.3% of group A) who had residual tumor in noneloquent areas after 1 or 2 further resection extensions. Io-MRI enhanced both EOR and 6-month progression-free survival (6-PFS): the overall GTR for group A amounted to 88.5% (n = 69), whereas for group B it was 44% (n = 16). 6-PFS accounted for 73% (n = 57) for group A and 38.9% (n = 14) for group B.; CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that Io-MRI may lead to EOR optimization and associated 6-PFS improvement.

N2  -  Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the novel advanced magnetic resonance imaging findings of acute stage cortical laminar necrosis developing after complicated cardiovascular or abdominal surgery. Materials and methods This institutional review board-approved study included patients with postoperative stroke due to cortical laminar necrosis imaged with magnetic resonance in the acute stage. Brain magnetic resonance imaging examinations were obtained on a 3T magnetic resonance scanner within 48 hours of the neurological symptoms, including diffusion-weighted images (b value, 1000 s/mm(2)) and arterial spin labelling using a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling method in four patients. Conventional and advanced magnetic resonance images were analysed to assess the imaging features in acute stage cortical laminar necrosis. Results The final population consisted of 14 patients (seven men and seven women, mean age 61 years, range 32-79 years) diagnosed with stroke and acute phase cortical laminar necrosis. All the patients presented with cortical lesions showing restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted images and hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. Cortical hyperintensity on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images was found in three (21%) and six (43%) patients, respectively. Reduced perfusion was noted in three out of four patients imaged with arterial spin labelling, while in one case no corresponding perfusion abnormality was noted on the arterial spin labelling maps. Arterial spin labelling abnormalities were much more extensive than diffusion restriction in two patients, and they were associated with a poor outcome. Conclusion Cortical hyperintense abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging may be the only sign of developing cortical laminar necrosis injury. The acquisition of arterial spin labelling helps to identify perfusion alterations and the extension of the ischaemic injury.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) can detect early ischemic changes and is sometimes used as a surrogate neurological end point in clinical trials. Recent experimental stroke studies have shown that with brief periods of ischemia, some DWI lesions transiently reverse, only to recur later. This study examined the histological condition of the tissue during the period of DWI reversal.
Methods-Rats underwent 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. DWI images were obtained during ischemia and 3 to 5 hours, 1 day, and 7 days later. MRI scans were compared with histology (5 hours, n=5; 7 days, n=5) with the use of neuronal (microtubule-associated protein 2 MAP2) and astrocytic (glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP) markers and heat-shock protein 72 (HSP72).; Results-DWI abnormalities reversed 3 to 5 hours after ischemia onset but recurred at 1 day. Four animals showed complete reversal of the initial DWI hyperintensity, and 6 showed partial reversal. When the 5-hour DWI was completely normal, there was significant loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity, comprising approximately 30% of the initial DWI lesion. However, GFAP staining revealed morphologically normal astrocytes. HSP72 immunoreactivity at 5 hours was extensive and corresponded to the initial DWI lesion.; Conclusions-After brief ischemic periods, normalization of the DWI does not necessarily imply that the tissue is normal. Neurons already exhibit evidence of structural damage and stress. Normal GFAP staining suggests that other nonneuronal cell populations may partially compensate for altered fluid balances at the time of DWI reversal despite the presence of neuronal injury. These observations suggest that caution is warranted when relying solely on DWI for assessment of ischemic damage.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To investigate additional information provided by maps of relative cerebral blood flow in functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of human hyperacute cerebral ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted and hemodynamic MR imaging were performed in 23 patients less than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Maps of relative cerebral blood flow and tracer mean tissue transit time were computed, as were maps of apparent diffusion and relative cerebral blood volume. Acute lesion volumes on the maps were compared with follow-up imaging findings.; RESULTS: In 15 of 23 subjects (65%), blood flow maps revealed hemodynamic abnormalities not visible on blood volume maps. A mismatch between initial blood flow and diffusion findings predicted growth of infarct more often (12 of 15 subjects with infarcts that grew) than did a mismatch between initial blood volume and diffusion findings (eight of 15). However, lesion volumes on blood volume and diffusion maps correlated better with eventual infarct volumes (r > 0.90) than did those on blood flow and tracer mean transit time maps (r similar to 0.6), likely as a result of threshold effects. In eight patients, blood volume was elevated around the diffusion abnormality, suggesting a compensatory hemodynamic response.; CONCLUSION: MR imaging carl delineate areas of altered blood flow, blood volume, and water mobility in hyperacute human stroke. Predictive models of tissue outcome may benefit by including computation of both relative cerebral blood flow and blood volume.

N2  -  Background: The pathological mechanisms of early brain injury (EBI) have remained obscure. Several studies have reported on the neuroradiological findings of EBI. However, to our knowledge, no study has attempted to explore the mechanism of EBI after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Therefore, this study evaluates whether the initial plasma D-dimer levels were associated with EBI, classifies magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) findings, and speculates about the mechanism of EBI. Methods: This study included 97 patients hospitalized within 24 h from the onset of nontraumatic SAH. The patients underwent MRI within 0-5 days from onset (before vasospasm) to detect EBI. EBI was radiologically defined as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-positive lesions that appear dark on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, excluding procedure-related lesions. EBI, plasma D-dimer levels, and clinical features were retrospectively investigated. Results: Elevated D-dimer levels were associated with poor outcomes. Patients with EBI had significantly higher D-dimer levels than those without EBI. EBI was detected in 24 patients (27.3%) of all, and in 22 (45%) of 49 patients with World Federation of Neurosurgi-cal Societies (WFNS) grade 4-5 SAH. EBI was frequently observed in the parame-dian frontal lobe. There were several types of the pathology in EBI, including widespread symmetrical cerebral cortex lesions, focal cortex lesions, periventricular injury, and other lesions impossible to classify due to unknown mechanisms such as thrombotic complication and microcirculatory disturbance, ultra-early spasm, and spreading depolarization. Conclusions: This study suggests that D-dimer levels predict poor outcomes in patients with SAH and that EBI was associated high D-dimer levels. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-A mismatch between diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI is thought to define tissue at risk of infarction. This concept is based on the assumption that diffusion slowing of and decreases in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) serve as indicator of tissue proceeding to infarction. We tested this hypothesis.
Methods-MRI (diffusion weighted, perfusion weighted, MRA, T2 weighted) was performed in 15 patients with acute stroke within 2.9 +- 0.8 hours (mean+-SD) of onset and on days 1 and 7. After intraindividual realignment of the ADC maps, the development of ADC range volumes and ADC values was determined.; Results-An increase (354%, group A1) in the total ADC-based lesion volume below a threshold of <80% occurred in 4 patients on day 1, persisting on day 7 with a pronounced increase of ADC range volumes with low ADC values. AD increase in total ADC-based lesion volume (201%, group A2) followed by a secondary drop to day 7 was found in 7 patients. A significant reduction in total ADC-based lesion volume (14%, group B) was found in 4 patients. ADC-based lesion volume increase was associated with persistent vessel occlusion in group A, whereas recanalization in group B resulted in ADC volume decrease. ADC normalization was observed independently from the degree of the initial ADC decrease on days 1 and 7 in group B.; Conclusions-In line with results from animal experiments, ADC decreases do not reliably indicate tissue infarction Even severely decreased ADC values may normalize in human stroke, and it seems likely that ADC normalization depends on the duration and severity of ischemia rather than the absolute value.

N2  -  Modern glioma surgery has evolved around the central tenet of safely maximizing resection. Recent surgical adjuncts have focused on increasing the maximum extent of resection while minimizing risk to functional brain. Technologies such as cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping, intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, functional neuronavigation, navigable intraoperative ultrasound, neuroendoscopy, and fluorescence-guided resection have been developed to augment the identification of tumor while preserving brain anatomy and function. However, whether these technologies offer additional long-term benefits to glioma patients remains to be determined. Here we review advances over the past decade in operative technologies that have offered the most promising benefits for glioblastoma patients.

N2  -  Neuroimaging is presently utilised in clinical practice for initial diagnosis and mapping of disease extent and distribution, noninvasive, preoperative grading of tumours, biopsy planning, surgery and radiation portal planning for tumors, judging response to therapy and finally, prognostication. Newer advances include magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, perfusion imaging, MR spectroscopy and functional imaging using the blood oxygen level-dependent contrast technique. Neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in various degenerative and neoplastic diseases, improving diagnostic accuracy, affecting patient care, monitoring dynamic changes within the brain during therapy, and establishing them as the arbiter of novel therapy that may one day prove cure of various brain diseases a reality.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) combined with optic radiation neuronavigation may be safer for resection of cerebral lesions involving the optic radiation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether iMRI combined with optic radiation neuronavigation can help maximize tumor resection while protecting the patient's visual field.; METHODS: Forty-four patients with cerebral tumors adjacent to the optic radiation were enrolled in the study. The reconstructed optic radiations were observed so that a reasonable surgical plan could be developed. During the surgery, microscope-based fiber tract neuronavigation was routinely implemented. The lesion location (lateral or not to the optic radiation) and course of the optic radiation (stretched or not) were categorized, and their relationships to the visual field defect were determined.; RESULTS: Analysis of the visible relationship between the optic radiation and the lesion led to a change in surgical approach in 6 patients (14%). The mean tumor residual rate for glioma patients was 5.3% (n = 36) and 0% for patients with nonglioma lesions (n = 8). Intraoperative MRI and fiber tract neuronavigation increased the average size of resection (first and last iMRI scanning, 88.3% vs 95.7%; P < .01). Visual fields after surgery improved in 5 cases (11.4%), exhibited no change in 36 cases (81.8%), and were aggravated in 3 cases (6.8%).; CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging information was helpful in surgical planning. When iMRI was combined with fiber tract neuronavigation, the resection rate of brain lesions involving the optic radiation was increased in most patients without harming the patients' visual fields.

N2  -  The ability of preoperative MRI-sequences to predict the consistency of intracranial meningiomas has not yet been clearly defined. We aim to demonstrate that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) improves the prediction of intracranial meningiomas consistency.
We prospectively studied 110 meningioma patients operated on in a single center from March 1st to the 25th of May 2012. Demographic data, location and size of the tumor, peritumoral edema, T1WI, T2WI, proton density weighted (PDWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recover (FLAIR) sequences, and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion were studied and compared with the gray matter signal to predict meningioma consistency. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were included in the preoperative MRI. Meningioma consistency was evaluated by the operating surgeon who was unaware of the neuroradiological findings.; In univariate analysis, meningioma size (diameter > 2 cm) and supratentorial or sphenoidal wing location were more frequently associated with hard-consistency meningiomas (p < 0.05). In addition, isointense signal on MD maps (p = 0.009), hyperintense signal on FA maps, and FA value > 0.3 (p = 0.00001) were associated with hard-consistency tumors. Age and sex, T1WI, T2WI, PDWI, FLAIR, or ASL perfusion sequences and peritumoral edema were not significantly associated with meningioma consistency. In logistic regression analysis, the most accurate model (AUC: 0.9459) for predicting a hard-consistency meningioma shows that an isointense signal in MD-maps, a hyperintense signal in FA-maps, and an FA value of more than 0.3 have a significant predictive value.; FA value and MD and FA maps are useful for prediction of meningioma consistency and, therefore, may be considered in the preoperative routine MRI examination of all patients with intracranial meningiomas.

N2  -  We describe a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique for detecting metabolism indirectly through changes in oxyhemoglobin: deoxyhemoglobin ratios and T2* signal change during 'oxygen challenge' (OC, 5 mins 100% O-2). During OC, T2* increase reflects O2 binding to deoxyhemoglobin, which is formed when metabolizing tissues take up oxygen. Here OC has been applied to identify tissue metabolism within the ischemic brain. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in rats. In series 1 scanning (n = 5), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed, followed by echo-planar T2* acquired during OC and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI, arterial spin labeling). Oxygen challenge induced a T2* signal increase of 1.8%, 3.7%, and 0.24% in the contralateral cortex, ipsilateral cortex within the PWI/DWI mismatch zone, and ischemic core, respectively. T2* and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map coregistration revealed that the T2* signal increase extended into the ADC lesion (3.4%). In series 2 (n = 5), FLASH T2* and ADC maps coregistered with histology revealed a T2* signal increase of 4.9% in the histologically defined border zone (55% normal neuronalmorphology, located within the ADC lesion boundary) compared with a 0.7% increase in the cortical ischemic core (92% neuronal ischemic cell change, core ADC lesion). Oxygen challenge has potential clinical utility and, by distinguishing metabolically active and inactive tissues within hypoperfused regions, could provide a more precise assessment of penumbra.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Rapid word recognition and reading fluency is a specialized cortical process governed by the visual word form area (VWFA), which is localized to the dominant posterior lateral occipitotemporal sulcus/fusiform gyrus. A lesion of the VWFA results in pure alexia without agraphia characterized by letter-by-letter reading. Palinopsia is a visual processing distortion characterized by persistent afterimages and has been reported in lesions involving the nondominant occipitotemporal cortex.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old right-handed woman with no neurologic history presented to our emergency department with acute cortical ischemic symptoms that began with a transient episode of receptive aphasia. She also reported inability to read, albeit with retained writing ability. She also saw afterimages of objects. During her stroke workup, an intra-axial circumscribed enhancing mass lesion was discovered involving her dominant posterolateral occipitotemporal lobe. Given the eloquent brain involvement, she underwent preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging tractography and awake craniotomy to maximize resection and preserve function.; CONCLUSIONS: Many organic lesions involving these regions have been reported in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge, glioblastoma involving the VWFA resulting in both clinical syndromes of pure alexia and palinopsia with superimposed functional magnetic resonance imaging and fiber tract mapping has never been reported before.

N2  -  PurposeThe rising promise in the utility of advanced multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning creates a necessity for testing and enhancing the accuracy of quantitative imaging analysis. Standardizing the analysis of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to generate meaningful and reproducible apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) lays the requisite needed for clinical integration. The aim of the demonstrated work is to benchmark the generation of the ADC and FA parametric map analyses using integrated tools in a commercial treatment planning system against the currently used ones.MethodsThree software packages were used for generating ADC and FA maps in this study; one tool was developed within a commercial treatment planning system, another by the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library FSL (Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, United Kingdom), and an in-house tool developed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. The ADC and FA maps generated by all three packages for 35 subjects were subtracted from one another, and the standard deviation of the images' differences was used to compare the reproducibility. The reproducibility of the ADC maps was compared with the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) protocol, while that of the FA maps was compared to data in published literature.ResultsResults show that the discrepancies between the ADC maps calculated for each patient using the three different software algorithms are less than 2% which meets the 3.6% recommended QIBA requirement. Except for a small number of isolated points, the majority of differences in FA maps for each patient produced by the three methods did not exceed 0.02 which is 10 times lower than the differences seen in healthy gray and white matter. The results were also compared to the maps generated by existing MR Imaging consoles and showed that the robustness of console generated ADC and FA maps is largely dependent on the correct application of scaling factors, that only if correctly placed; the differences between the three tested methods and the console generated values were within the recommended QIBA guidelines.ConclusionsCross-comparison difference maps demonstrated that quantitative reproducibility of ADC and FA metrics generated using our tested commercial treatment planning system were comparable to in-house and established tools as benchmarks. This integrated approach facilitates the clinical utility of diffusion imaging in radiation treatment planning workflow.

N2  -  Peri-tumoral signal abnormalities of brain tumors contain varieties of tissues. A better delineation of the tissue contents may facilitate therapeutic strategy and improve clinical outcome. Six patients (3 meningiomas, 3 high-grade gliomas) were recruited in this study. Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired before and after tumor resection. Pre- and post-surgical fractional anisotropy (FA) of peri-tumoral signal abnormality was calculated. Three meningiomas were totally removed. Their pre-surgical peri-tumoral mean FA was 0.246 +/- 0.046. Peri-tumoral signal abnormality in two meningiomas vanished completely after surgery (FA recovered to 0.402 +/- 0.045) but not in the patient who had been previously treated by radiation. For the tree high-grate gliomas, their pre-surgical peri-tuumoral mean FA was 0.180 +/- 0.027. Complete tumor resection could be achieved in any of them. Post-surgical peri-tumoral mean FA of an anaplastic astrocytoma was 0.191 +/- 0.018. Pathological, surgical and imaging correlative analysis confirmed vasogenic edema of peri-tumoral tissues in meningioma and tumor infiltration in high grade-glioma. Peri-tumoral signal abnormality of meningiomas with higher FA (>= 0.2) had higher chance to recover in a shorter time interval after tumor resection, and the clinical outcome was better. High-grade gliomas contain lower FA (<0.2) in the peri-tuumoral region. Their post-surgical peri-tumoral high signal on T2W remained mostly. High FA may indicate better tissue integrity, and low FA may indicate interstitial tumor infiltration and tissue injury. DTI can be used not only as pre-surgical trajectory guidance but also used as a predictor of post-surgical outcome.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intraoperative displacement of major white matter tracts during glioma resection by comparing preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking.
METHODS: In 37 patients undergoing glioma surgery, preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions. For threedimensional tractography, we implemented a knowledge-based multiple-region-ofinterest approach applying user-defined seed regions in the color-coded maps of fractional anisotropy. Tracking was initiated in both the retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the principal eigenvector in each voxel of the region of interest. The tractography results were also assigned color, applying the convention used in color-coded fractional anisotropy maps.; RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking was technically feasible in all patients. Fiber tract visualization gave a quick and intuitive overview of the displaced course of white matter tracts in three-dimensional space. Comparison of preoperative and intraloperative tractography depicted a marked shifting of major white matter tracts during glioma removal. Maximum white matter tract shifting ranged from -8 to + 15 mm (+2.7 +- 6.0 mm; mean +- standard deviation); in 29.7%, an inward and in 62.2%, an outward shifting was detected.; CONCLUSION: Comparing preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking visualizes a marked shifting and deformation of major white matter tracts because of tumor removal. This shifting emphasizes the need for an intraoperative update of navigation systems during resection of deep-seated tumor portions near eloquent brain areas. Fiber tracking is a method not only for preoperative neurosurgical visualization but also for further intraciperative planning.

N2  -  Extensive growth in functional brain imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, brain mapping and brain scanning techniques has led tremendously to the importance of the cerebral cortical segmentation, both in 2-D and 3-D, from volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging data sets. Besides that, recent growth in deformable brain segmentation techniques in 2-D and 3-D has brought the engineering community, such as the areas of computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition and graphics, closer to the medical community, such as to neuro-surgeons, psychiatrists, oncologists, neuro-radiologists and internists. This paper is an attempt to review the state-of-the-art 2-D and 3-D cerebral cortical segmentation techniques from brain magnetic resonance imaging based on three main classes: region-based, boundary/surface-based and fusion of boundary/surface-based with region-based techniques. In the first class, region-based techniques, we demonstrated more than 18 different techniques for segmenting the cerebral cortex from brain slices acquired in orthogonal directions. In the second class, boundary/surface-based, we showed more than ten different techniques to segment the cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance brain volumes. Particular emphasis will be placed by presenting four state-of-the-art systems in the third class, based on the fusion of boundary/surface-based with region-based techniques outlined in Part II of the paper, also called regional-geometric deformation models, which take the paradigm of partial differential equations in the level set framework. We also discuss the pros and cons of various techniques, besides giving the mathematical foundations for each sub-class in the cortical taxonomy.

N2  -  Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols of T2-, T-2-(*), diffusion-and susceptibility-weighted imaging (T2WI, (T2WI)-W-*, DWI, and SWI, respectively) with a 7T system, we tested the hypothesis that treatment of embolic stroke with erythropoietin (EPO) initiated at 24 hr and administered daily for 7 days after stroke onset has benefit in repairing ischemic cerebral tissue. Adult Wistar rats were subjected to embolic stroke by means of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 11) or a control (n 5 11) group. The treated group was given EPO intraperitoneally at a dose of 5,000 IU/kg daily for 7 days starting 24 hr after MCAO. Controls were given an equal volume of saline. MRI was performed at 24 hr and then weekly for 6 weeks. MRI and histological measurements were compared between groups. Serial T2WI demonstrated that expansion of the ipsilateral ventricle was significantly reduced in the EPO-treated rats. The volume ratio of ipsilateral parenchymal tissue relative to the contralateral hemisphere was significantly increased after EPO treatment compared with control animals, indicating that EPO significantly reduces atrophy of the ipsilateral hemisphere, although no significant differences in ischemic lesion volume were observed between the two groups. Angiogenesis and white matter remodeling were significantly increased and occurred earlier in EPO-treated animals than in the controls, as evident from (T2WI)-W-* and diffusion anisotropy maps, respectively. These data indicate that EPO treatment initiated 24 hr poststroke promotes angiogenesis and axonal remodeling in the ischemic boundary, which may potentially reduce atrophy of the ipsilateral hemisphere.

N2  -  BackgroundEpidermoid cysts are benign, slow growing extra-axial lesions most commonly found in the cerebellopontine angle that have a characteristic imaging pattern of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).MethodsA 10-year-old male with a history of asthma and diabetes was found to have a lesion within the fourth ventricle on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain study. MRI showed a well-circumscribed vermian lesion without contrast enhancement or restricted diffusion with mild hydrocephalus. He was referred to the neurosurgical service once he acutely developed symptoms of dizziness. He underwent a gross-total resection of the lesion on which histopathology confirmed an epidermoid cyst.ResultsHere, we report a case of an atypical epidermoid cysts found in the midline of the fourth ventricle without restricted diffusion on MRI.ConclusionAvid restricted-diffusion on DWI is usually pathognomonic for an epidermoid cyst when evaluating an extra-axial lesion, yet we report the second case in the literature of an epidermoid cyst without this classical imaging characteristic.

N2  -  Meningiomas that arise in the atria of the lateral ventricles are relatively rare lesions, that pose a unique challenge for surgery due to their deep-seated location and proximity to critical white matter tracts. Size and anatomical variations can affect the best approach for these tumors, with several approaches described to access the atrium including the interhemispheric trans-precuneus, trans-supramarginal gyrus, distal trans-sylvian, supracerebellar trans-collateral sulcus, and finally the trans-intraparietal sulcus approach, which was the choice for this case. Minimally invasive techniques that preserve the surrounding tissue are becoming increas-ingly popular and are perfectly suited to deep seated lesions. The relevant subcortical anatomy surrounding the atrium is discussed. The optic radiations form the lateral wall of the atrium, whereas commissural fibers of the tapetum form the roof of the atrium, and superficial to these fibers we have the superior longitudinal fasciculus that have vertical rami that communicate with the superior parietal lobule. Utilizing the posterior half of the intraparietal sulcus can preserve these fibers. The use of neuronavigation, brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography may be helpful in the surgical planning. In this article, we present a surgical video of a trans-tubular interparietal sulcus approach for resection of an atrium meningioma. A 43-year-old right-handed female who presented with progressive headaches and a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was found to have an atrial meningioma that grew in follow-up and surgery was recommended. We chose the posterior intraparietal sulcus approach as it provides a good angle of attack while preserving the optic radiations and most of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, using a tubular retractor to minimize tissue damage. Gross total resection of the tumor was achieved with complete preservation of patient neurological function.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We used quantitative diffusion MR imaging to investigate the microstructural changes that occur in white matter during normal aging in order to identify regional changes in anisotropy and to quantify global microstructural changes by use of whole-brain diffusion histograms.
METHODS: Full diffusion tensor MR imaging was performed in 20 healthy volunteers, 20 to 91 years old. Thirteen subjects also underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging, so that diffusion images could be coregistered and standardized to normal coordinates for statistical probability mapping, Relative anisotropy (RA) was calculated, as was linear regression of RA with age for each pixel; pixels with a significant correlation coefficient were displayed. For histographic analysis, the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Subjects were divided into two equal groups by the median age (55 years) of the population and plotted for statistical comparison.; RESULTS: Regional analysis showed statistically significant decreases in RA with increasing age in the periventricular white matter, frontal white matter, and genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, despite the absence of signal abnormalities on visual inspection of conventional images. Significant increases in RA were found in the internal capsules bilaterally. ADC histograms showed higher mean ADC and reduced peak height and skew in the older age group on group comparisons.; CONCLUSION: Quantitative diffusion histograms correlate with normal aging and may provide a global assessment of normal age-related changes and serve as a standard for comparison with neurodegenerative diseases.

N2  -  Quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI has been applied to the study of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, where the molecular self-diffusion coefficient D has been measured in both lesions and normal-appearing white matter. Histograms of D have been used as a novel measure of the "lesion load", with potential applications that include the monitoring of efficacy in new treatment trials. However different ways of measuring D may affect its value, making comparison between different centres and research groups impossible. We aimed to assess the effect, If any, of using two different MRI sequences on the value of D. We studied 13 healthy volunteers, using two different quantitative diffusion sequences (including different b(max) values and gradient applications). Maps of D were analysed using both regions of interest (ROI) in white matter and "whole brain" histograms, and compared between the two sequences. In addition, we studied three standardised test liquids (with known values of D) using both sequences. Histograms from the two sequences had different distributions, with a greater spread and higher peak position from the sequence with lower bmax. This greater spread of D was also evident in the white matter and test liquid ROI. "Limits of agreement" analysis demonstrated that the differences could be clinically relevant, despite significant correlations between the sequences obtained using simple rank methods. We conclude that different quantitative diffusion sequences are unlikely to produce directly comparable values of D, particularly if different b(max) values are used. In addition, the use of inappropriate statistical tests may give false impressions of close agreement. Standardisation of methods for the measurement of D are required if these techniques are to become useful tools, for example in monitoring changes in the disease burden of multiple sclerosis.

N2  -  Introduction We investigated the diffusion-weighted MRI changes, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, and conventional MRI findings in specific brain areas during migraine attacks in patients with and without aura.
Methods Included in the study were 22 patients (2 male, 20 female) aged between 17 and 49 years who were diagnosed as having migraine according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. Also included in the study were 18 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Hyperintense lesions were evaluated in conventional MR images. Heavily diffusion-weighted images, ADC maps, and segmented ADC maps generated for regional ADC (rADC) measurements, were also studied. ADC values from specific brain areas were used with appropriate region of interests (ROI).; Results Migraine with aura was diagnosed in 13 patients and migraine without aura was diagnosed in 9 patients. A total of 23 hyperintense lesions within the periventricular white matter and deep white matter were detected in five patients (21.8%). All of these hyperintense lesions were seen in migraine patients with aura. In only one patient did a hyperintense lesion show an increased diffusion pattern on diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps. One hyperintense lesion was detected in the control group (5.5%). There was no significant difference in ADC values between the migraine and control groups.; Conclusion T2-weighted hyperintense lesions were significantly more frequent in migraine patients especially in those with aura than in the control group. No diffusion alterations in diffusion-weighted images were detected in the infra- and supratentorial brain areas during migraine attacks in patients with and without aura.

N2  -  ObjectiveWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in older adults and are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This study aims to estimate changes in the structural connectome due to age-related WMH by using a virtual lesion approach.MethodsHigh-quality diffusion-weighted imaging data of 30 healthy subjects were obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. Diffusion tractography using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR) and whole brain fiber tracking with 107 seed points was conducted using diffusion spectrum imaging studio and the brainnetome atlas was used to parcellate a total of 246 cortical and subcortical nodes. Previously published WMH frequency maps across age ranges (50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's) were used to generate virtual lesion masks for each decade at three lesion frequency thresholds, and these virtual lesion masks were applied as regions of avoidance (ROA) in fiber tracking to estimate connectivity changes. Connections showing significant differences in fiber density with and without ROA were identified using paired tests with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.ResultsDisconnections appeared first from the striatum to middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the 50's, then from the thalamus to MFG in the 60's and extending to the superior frontal gyrus in the 70's, and ultimately including much more widespread cortical and hippocampal nodes in the 80's.ConclusionChanges in the structural disconnectome due to age-related WMH can be estimated using the virtual lesion approach. The observed disconnections may contribute to the cognitive and sensorimotor deficits seen in aging.

N2  -  Our aim was to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with spin-echo echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences (SE-EPI-DWI) in the study of primary and secondary soft-tissue tumours by correlating the results of imaging and histology.
We retrospectively studied 23 patients (14 men, 9 women; age range 25-87 years) affected by soft-tissue lesions. The MRI study was performed with baseline and contrast-enhanced SE-T1, proton densityT2-weighted (PDT2), fat-saturated (FATSAT) DPT2 and single-shot SE-EPI-DWI (b value 50-400- 800smm2) sequences.; We identified 723 benign lesions (three myxoid, four nonmyxoid) and 1623 malignant tumours (four myxoid, 12 nonmyxoid) with a mean diameter between 21 mm and 20 cm. Qualitative analysis of DWI showed persistence of high signal intensity for increasing b-values in all malignant tumours. Quantitative DWI analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps showed a statistical difference between benign and malignant lesions.; In our experience, DWI with qualitative and quantitative analysis correlated well with histology.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound is a novel technique that was developed to enable precise, image-guided targeting and destruction of tumors by thermocoagulation. The system, ExAblate2000, is a focused ultrasound delivery system embedded within the MRI bed of a conventional diagnostic MRI scanner. The device delivers small volumetric sonications from an ultrasound phased array transmitter that converge energy to selectively destroy the target. Temperature maps generated by the MRI scanner verify the location and thermal rise as feedback, as well as thermal destruction. To assess the safety, feasibility, and precision of this technology in the brain, we have used the ExAblate system to create predefined thermal lesions in the brains of pigs.
METHODS: Ten pigs underwent bilateral craniectomy to provide a bone window for the ultrasound beams. Seven to 10 days later, the animals were anesthetized and positioned in the ExAblate system. A predefined, 1-cm(3) frontal para ventricular region was delineated as the target and treated with multiple sonications. MRI was performed immediately and I week after treatment. The animals were then sacrificed and the brains removed for pathological study. The size of individual sonication points and the location of the lesion were compared between the planned dose maps, posttreatment MRI scans, and pathological specimen.; RESULTS: High-energy sonications led to precise coagulation necrosis of the specified targets as shown by subsequent MRI, macroscopic, and histological analysis. The thermal lesions were sharply demarcated from the surrounding brain with no anatomic or histological abnormalities outside the target.; CONCLUSION: MRI-guided focused ultrasound proved a precise and an effective means to destroy anatomically predefined brain targets by thermocoagulation with minimal associated edema or damage to adjacent structures. Contrast-enhanced T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MRI scans may be used for real-time assessment of tissue destruction.

N2  -  Background: Non-invasive brain mapping using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a valuable tool prior to resection of malignant brain tumors. With nTMS motor mapping, it is additionally possible to analyze the function of the motor system and to evaluate tumor-induced neuroplasticity. Distinct changes in motor cortex excitability induced by certain malignant brain tumors are a focal point of research. Methods: A retrospective single-center study was conducted involving patients with malignant brain tumors. Clinical data, resting motor threshold (rMT), and nTMS-based tractography were evaluated. The interhemispheric rMT-ratio (rMT(Tumor)/rMT(Control)) was calculated for each extremity and considered pathological if it was >>110% or <<90%. Distances between the corticospinal tract and the tumor (lesion-to-tract-distance - LTD) were measured. Results: 49 patients were evaluated. 16 patients (32.7%) had a preoperative motor deficit. The cohort comprised 22 glioblastomas (44.9%), 5 gliomas of Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS WHO) grade 3 (10.2%), 6 gliomas of CNS WHO grade 2 (12.2%) and 16 cerebral metastases (32.7%). 26 (53.1%) had a pathological rMT-ratio for the upper extremity and 35 (71.4%) for the lower extremity. All patients with tumor-induced motor deficits had pathological interhemispheric rMT-ratios, and presence of tumor-induced motor deficits was associated with infiltration of the tumor to the nTMS-positive cortex (p = 0.04) and shorter LTDs (all p << 0.021). Pathological interhemispheric rMT-ratio for the upper extremity was associated with cerebral metastases, but not with gliomas (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Our study underlines the diagnostic potential of nTMS motor mapping to go beyond surgical risk stratification. Pathological alterations in motor cortex excitability can be measured with nTMS mapping. Pathological cortical excitability was more frequent in cerebral metastases than in gliomas.

N2  -  The myelin g-ratio, defined as the ratio between the inner and the outer diameter of the myelin sheath, is a fundamental property of white matter that can be computed from a simple formula relating the myelin volume fraction to the fiber volume fraction or the axon volume fraction. In this paper, a unique combination of magnetization transfer, diffusion imaging and histology is presented, providing a novel method for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the axon volume fraction and the myelin g-ratio. Our method was demonstrated in the corpus callosum of one cynomolgus macaque, and applied to obtain full-brain g-ratio maps in one healthy human subject and one multiple sclerosis patient. In the macaque, the g-ratio was relatively constant across the corpus callosum, as measured by both MRI and electron microscopy. In the human subjects, the g-ratio in multiple sclerosis lesions was higher than in normal appearing white matter, which was in turn higher than in healthy white matter. Measuring the g-ratio brings us one step closer to fully characterizing white matter non-invasively, making it possible to perform in vivo histology of the human brain during development, aging, disease and treatment.

N2  -  Neuroimaging plays a significant role in the diagnosis of intracranial tumors, especially brain gliomas, and must consist of an assessment of location and extent of the tumor and of its biologic activity. Therefore, morphologic imaging modalities and functional, metabolic, or molecular imaging modalities should be combined for primary diagnosis and for following the course and evaluating therapeutic effects. MRI is the gold standard for providing detailed morphologic information and can supply some additional insights into metabolism (MR spectroscopy) and perfusion (perfusion-weighted imaging) but still has limitations in identifying tumor grade, invasive growth into neighboring tissue, and treatment-induced changes, as well as recurrences. These insights can be obtained by various PET modalities, including imaging of glucose metabolism, amino acid uptake, nucleoside uptake, and hypoxia. Diagnostic accuracy can benefit from coregistration of PET results and MRI, combining the high-resolution morphologic images with the biologic information. These procedures are optimized by the newly developed combination of PET and MRI modalities, permitting the simultaneous assessment of morphologic, functional, metabolic, and molecular information on the human brain.

The limitations of common approaches for visualizing the retrieved data are discussed and a new statistical method is presented to assess the reliability of the acquired tensor field. A novel visualization method is proposed which is discussed in light of neurophysiological considerations of the perception of colored patterns. It is argued that this method is more accurate for medical data while providing a nearly optimal visual stimulus. The method is evaluated on a patient study with a brain tumor.

N2  -  Imaging heterogeneous cancer lesions is a real challenge. For diagnosis, histology often remains the reference, but it is widely acknowledged that biopsies are not reliable. There is thus a strong interest in establishing a link between clinical in vivo imaging and the biologic properties of tissues. In this study, we propose to construct histology-resembling images based on tissue microvascularization, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accessible source of contrast. To integrate the large amount of information collected with microvascular MRI, we combined a manual delineation of a spatial region of interest with an unsupervised, model-based cluster analysis (Mc lust). This approach was applied to two rat models of glioma (C6 and F98). Six MRI parameters were mapped: apparent diffusion coefficient, vessel wall permeability, cerebral blood volume fraction, cerebral blood flow, tissular oxygen saturation, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Five clusters, defined by their MRI features, were found to correspond to specific histologic features, and revealed intratumoral spatial structures. These results suggest that the presence of a cluster within a tumor can be used to assess the presence of a tissue type. In addition, the cluster composition, i.e., a signature of the intratunnoral structure, could be used to characterize tumor models as histology does.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to identify differences in structural and functional brain connectivity between poststroke mild and severe motor impairment. Twenty-four chronic stroke patients who underwent resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor image were retrospectively included. All patients were classified into two groups (mild motor impairment: 11 patients and severe motor impairment: 13 patients) according to their Fugl-Meyer motor assessment score. Tract-based spatial statistics and group independent component analyses were applied to investigate between-group differences in structural and functional connectivity, respectively. The fractional anisotropy values of motor-related brain regions in the affected hemisphere were significantly higher in mild motor impairment than in severe motor impairment (corrected P<0.05). The internetwork functional connectivity between (i) the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex in the affected hemisphere, (ii) the supplementary motor area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the unaffected hemisphere, and (iii) the ischemic lesion and primary motor cortex in the unaffected hemisphere was significantly higher in mild motor impairment than in severe motor impairment (P-FWE<0.05). Better motor recovery after stroke could be facilitated by means of treatments aimed at enhancing structural and functional connectivity among motor-related brain regions such as noninvasive brain stimulation and neurodevelopmental therapy.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-There is no conclusive experimental support that decompressive surgery in late stages of space-occupying cerebral infarction will improve outcome. We studied the effects of delayed decompressive surgery on the development of tissue damage, edema formation, and cerebral perfusion with different MRI techniques in a rat model of space-occupying cerebral infarction.
Methods-Permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was performed in 6 Fisher 344 rats. Decompressive surgery was performed 17 hours after the occlusion. Each animal was assessed before surgery and 2 and 4 hours after surgery by means, of diffusion-weighted T2-weighted, and flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery perfusion-weighted MRI. Ischemic damage was also evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections.; Results-Lesion volume as derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps decreased from 522+-98 mm(3) before to 405+-100 mm(3) (P=0.016) 4 hours after decompressive surgery, whereas lesion volume from T2 maps increased from 420+-66 mm(3) before to 510+-92 mm(3) (P=0.048) 4 hours after decompressive surgery. Midline shift decreased from 1.4+-0.1 mm to 0.5+-0.2 mm (P=0.001). Blood flow in the noninfarcted area of the ipsilateral hemisphere improved from 25+-9 mLmin100 g of tissue to 38+-9 mLmin100 g of tissue (P=0.035). Despite the pseudonormalization of ADC, irreversible damage was found in the entire MCA territory on histological evaluation.; Conclusions-In rats with space-occupying cerebral infarction, delayed decompressive surgery leads to a decrease in lesion volume derived from ADC maps, which is probably because of an increase of extracellular water formation. There are no signs that this reflects rescue of ischemic tissue.

N2  -  Introduction Toxoplasmosis and lymphoma are common lesions of the central nervous system in patients with AIDS. It is often difficult to distinguish between these lesions both clinically and radiographically. Previous research has demonstrated restricted diffusion within cerebral lymphomas and bacterial abscesses. However, little work has been done to evaluate the diffusion characteristics of toxoplasmosis lesions. This study was designed to explore further the utility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and values in making the distinction between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma.
Methods The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 36 patients, including 22 with toxoplasmosis (all of whom had AIDS) and 14 with lymphoma (8 of whom had AIDS), at two institutions were reviewed retrospectively. The characteristics of the lesions on DWI were evaluated, and the ADC ratios of the lesions were calculated and compared.; Results There was significant overlap of the ADC ratios of toxoplasma and lymphoma, most notably in the intermediate (1.0-1.6) range. There was variability in ADC ratios even among different lesions in the same patient. In only a minority of the lymphoma patients were the ADC ratios low enough to suggest the correct diagnosis.; Conclusion Our study showed that toxoplasmosis exhibits a wide spectrum of diffusion characteristics with ADC ratios which have significant overlap with those of lymphoma. Therefore, in the majority of patients, ADC ratios are not definitive in making the distinction between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma.

N2  -  Purpose. This paper describes our experience with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of fetal anatomical structures and major fetal pathologies.
Materials and methods. The retrospective study included 128 pregnant women between the 22nd and 38th week of gestation. We used the following imaging protocol: T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo sequences for all foetuses and, in selected cases, gradient echo with steady-state free precession (SSFP), T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo fast low-angle shot (FLASH) with and without fat saturation, and T2 thick-slab sequences with multiplanar technique. In 32 cases, we performed diffusion -weighted sequences with apparent diffusion coefficient (ACD) maps on the brain, the kidneys and the lungs.; Results. We achieved diagnostic-quality images in 125 of 128 patients; MR image quality was unsatisfactory in three cases only. In 16 cases with previous negative ultrasound (US) findings, MRI confirmed the US diagnosis. MRI confirmed the positive US diagnosis in 67 of 109 cases (61.5%); in 11 cases it changed the US diagnosis, and in 31109 the examination was negative. In addition, MRI identified other anomalies not recognised during US examination.; Conclusions. With its ultrafast sequences, fetal MRI provides good detail of normal fetal anatomy and allows characterisation of suspected anomalies.

N2  -  We examined the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cortical neurodegeneration in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) by investigating whether cortical thickness is a remote effect of WMH through structural fiber tract connectivity in a population at increased risk of CSVD. We measured cortical thickness on T1-weighted images and segmented WMH on FLAIR images in 930 participants of a population-based cohort study at baseline. DWI-derived whole-brain probabilistic tractography was used to define WMH connectivity to cortical regions. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to analyze the relationship between cortical thickness and connectivity to WMH. Factors associated with cortical thickness (age, sex, hemisphere, region, individual differences in cortical thickness) were added as covariates. Median age was 64 [IQR 46-76] years. Visual inspection of surface maps revealed distinct connectivity patterns of cortical regions to WMH. WMH connectivity to the cortex was associated with reduced cortical thickness (p = 0.009) after controlling for covariates. This association was found for periventricular WMH (p = 0.001) only. Our results indicate an association between WMH and cortical thickness via connecting fiber tracts. The results imply a mechanism of secondary neurodegeneration in cortical regions distant, yet connected to subcortical vascular lesions, which appears to be driven by periventricular WMH.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Radical resection of dominant insular gliomas is difficult because of their close vicinity with internal capsule, basal ganglia, and speech centers. Brain mapping techniques can be used to maximize the extent of tumor removal and to minimize postoperative morbidities by precise localization of eloquent cortical and subcortical areas.
METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed gliomas of dominant insula were enrolled. The exclusion criteria were severe cognitive disturbances, communication difficulty, age greater than 75 years, severe obesity, difficult airways for intubation and severe cardiopulmonary diseases. All were evaluated preoperatively with contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional brain MRI, and diffusion tensor tractography of language and motor systems. All underwent awake craniotomy with the same anesthesiology protocol. Intraoperative monitoring included continuous motor-evoked potential, electromyography, electrocorticography, direct electrical stimulation of cortex, and subcortical tracts. The patients were followed with serial neurologic examination and imaging.; RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled (4 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 43.6 years. Seven patients suffered from low-grade glioma, and 3 patients had high-grade glioma. The most common clinical presentation was seizure followed by speech disturbance, hemiparesis, and memory loss. Extent of tumor resection ranged from 73% to 100%. No mortality or new major postoperative neurologic deficit was encountered. Seizure control improved in three fourths of patients with medical refractory epilepsy. In one patient with speech disorder at presentation, the speech problem became worse after surgery.; CONCLUSION: Brain mapping during awake craniotomy helps to maximize extent of tumor resection while preserving neurologic function in patients with dominant insular lobe glioma.

N2  -  Primary brain tumors are notoriously hard to resect surgically. Due to their infiltrative nature, finding the optimal resection boundary without damaging healthy tissue can be challenging. One potential tool to help make this decision is diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. dMRI exploits the diffusion of water molecule along axons to generate a 3D modelization of the white matter bundles in the brain. This feature is particularly useful to visualize how a tumor affects its surrounding white matter and plan a surgical path. This paper reviews the different ways in which dMRI can be used to improve brain tumor resection, its benefits and also its limitations. We expose surgical tools that can be paired with dMRI to improve its impact on surgical outcome, such as loading the 3D tractography in the neuronavigation system and direct electrical stimulation to validate the position of the white matter bundles of interest. We also review articles validating dMRI findings using other anatomical investigation techniques, such as postmortem dissections, manganese-enhanced MRI, electrophysiological stimulations, and phantom studies with known ground truth. We will be discussing the areas of the brain where dMRI performs well and where the future challenges are. We will conclude this review with suggestions and take home messages for neurosurgeons, tractographers, and vendors for advancing the field and on how to benefit from tractography's use in clinical practice.

N2  -  Patients with malignant brain tumors involving the central region underwent a hybrid O-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine-PET-MR imaging and motor mapping by neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. The spatial relationship between functional tissue and lesion volumes as depicted by structural and metabolic imaging was analyzed. Tumor infiltration of the M1 region or the corticospinal tract as depicted by FET-PET is highly indicative of motor impairment, better than contrast-enhanced T1WI alone, and is of predictive value for operative-risk evaluation.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motor deficits in patients with brain tumors are caused mainly by irreversible infiltration of the motor network or by indirect mass effects; these deficits are potentially reversible on tumor removal. Here we used a novel multimodal imaging approach consisting of structural, functional, and metabolic neuroimaging to better distinguish these underlying causes in a preoperative setting and determine the predictive value of this approach.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with malignant brain tumors involving the central region underwent a hybrid O-(2-F-18fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine-PET-MR imaging and motor mapping by neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation. The functional maps served as localizers for DTI tractography of the corticospinal tract. The spatial relationship between functional tissue (motor cortex and corticospinal tract) and lesion volumes as depicted by structural and metabolic imaging was analyzed.; RESULTS: Motor impairment was found in nearly all patients in whom the contrast-enhanced T1WI or PET lesion overlapped functional tissue. All patients who functionally deteriorated after the operation showed such overlap on presurgical maps, while the absence of overlap predicted a favorable motor outcome. PET was superior to contrast-enhanced T1WI for revealing a motor deficit before the operation. However, the best correlation with clinical impairment was found for T2WI lesion overlap with functional tissue maps, but the prognostic value for motor recovery was not significant.; CONCLUSIONS: Overlapping contrast-enhanced T1WI or PET-positive signals with motor functional tissue were highly indicative of motor impairment and predictive for surgery-associated functional outcome. Such a multimodal diagnostic approach may contribute to the risk evaluation of operation-associated motor deficits in patients with brain tumors.

N2  -  Purpose: MR diffusion imaging was performed to investigate changes in water diffusion in patients with cerebral infarction. Methods: Diffusion maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were created to show local water mobility in the brain tissue in 15 patients. These ADC maps were compared with conventional T2-weighted images. Results: Distinct subregions with different water diffusions were detected, even when the infarcted area appeared homogeneous on a T2-weighted image. The results also show that stroke lesions of the same age can have very different water diffusions. A trend towards an increasing diffusion coefficient in a lesion during the first several days following an acute event was observed in a group of patients imaged at multiple timepoints. Conclusion: The measurement of diffusion coefficients in vivo now offers an opportunity for greater understanding of the biophysical changes that occur during the evolution of infarction in humans.

N2  -  Brain networks contain a minority of highly connected hub nodes with high topological value and biological cost. Using network analysis of DTI data from healthy volunteers, and meta-analyses of published MRI studies in 26 brain disorders, Crossley et al. show that lesions across disorders tend to be concentrated at hubs.Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly connected hub nodes that are functionally valuable, because their topological centrality supports integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other brain regions, and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological cost, we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first identified the hubs of brain anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy volunteers (n = 56), and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps, based on meta-analyses of published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal brain connectome (P < 10(-4), permutation test). Specifically, nine brain disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs (P < 0.05, permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions, although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion probability in Alzheimer's disease, whereas in schizophrenia lesions were concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many (if not all) brain disorders.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this work was to compare diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with conventional MRI in the detection of shearing injuries in acute closed head injuries.
Method: Twenty-five patients (19 male, 6 female) were examined within 48 h of trauma. Conventional MRI included T2-weighted fast spin echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2*-weighted gradient echo sequences. Full tensor DWI with calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps was also performed. Lesions were identified and compared on all sequences.; Results: Four hundred twenty-seven lesions were counted by the combined use of all sequences. DWI identified 70 lesions not seen on conventional MRI. DWI identified 310 shearing injuries, followed by T2FLAIR (n = 248) and T2* (n = 202). The majority of DWI-positive lesions showed decreased diffusion (65%).; Conclusion: DWI is valuable in closed head injury because it identifies additional shearing injuries not visible on T2FLAIR or T2* sequences. Furthermore, DWIADC maps differentiate between lesions with decreased or increased diffusion. DWI is less sensitive than T2* imaging for detecting hemorrhagic lesions.

N2  -  In a model of experimental stroke, we characterize the effects of mild hypothermia, an effective neuroprotectant, on fluid shifts, cerebral perfusion and spreading depression (SD using diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI). Twenty-two rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and were either kept normothermic or rendered mildly hypothermic shortly after MCA occlusion for 2 h. DWI images were obtained 0.5, 2 and 24 h after MCA occlusion, and maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were generated. SD-Like transient ADC decreases were also detected using DWI in animals subjected to topical KCl application (n=4) and ischemia (n=6). Mild hypothermia significantly inhibited DWI lesion growth early after the onset of ischemia as well as 24 h later, and improved recovery of striatal ADC by 24 h. Mild hypothermia prolonged SD-like ADC transients and further decreased the ADC following KCI application and immediately after MCA occlusion. Cerebral perfusion, however, was not affected by temperature changes. We conclude that mild hypothermia is neuroprotective and suppresses infarct growth early after the onset of ischemia, with better ADC recovery. The ADC decrease during SD was greater during mild hypothermia, and suggests that the source of the ADC is more complex than previously believed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Validation and method of comparison for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) presenting pathology is a challenging task due to the lack of reliable ground truth. We propose a new method for generating synthetic multi-modal 3D brain MRI with tumor and edema, along with the ground truth. Tumor mass effect is modeled using a biornechanical model, while tumor and edema infiltration is modeled as a reaction-diffusion process that is guided by a modified diffusion tensor MR1. We propose the use of warping and geodesic interpolation on the diffusion tensors to simulate the displacement and the destruction of the white matter fibers. We also model the process where the contrast agent tends to accumulate in cortical csf regions and active tumor regions to obtain contrast enhanced T1w MR image that appear realistic. The result is simulated multi-modal MR1 with ground truth available as sets of probability maps. The system will be able to generate large sets of simulation images with tumors of varying size, shape and location, and will additionally generate infiltrated and deformed healthy tissue probabilities.

N2  -  Detailed knowledge of similarities and differences between animal models and human stroke is decisive for selecting clinically effective drugs based on efficacy data obtained preclinically. Differences in the temporal evolution of stroke pathologies between animal models and man have been reported. In view of the importance of this issue for the development of neuroprotective treatments, the temporal evolution of stroke pathologies in the rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model has been evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging modalities under experimental conditions matching as close as possible those used in humans. Changes in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex and striatum of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and spin-spin relaxation time (T-2), as well as total cortical and striatal infarct volumes, calculated from CBF, ADC, and T-2 maps, were determined starting 1 h up to 216 h post-pMCAO. The temporal evolution of the MRI parameters in this rat model was similar to that observed in humans. In particular, the ADC values were decreased for more than 3 days and returned back to baseline between 4 to 8 days, to increase by day 9 only. Thus the stroke pathology in this rat model develops at a similar pace as in stroke patients arguing against a fundamental difference in the mechanisms involved. The infarct volumes however develop differently in this rat model as they invariably increase over the first 48 h, while in humans the evolution of infarct volume is slower and more heterogeneous.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provide information at MR imaging that may reflect cell attenuation and integrity. We hypothesized that cerebellar tumors in children can be differentiated by their ADC values.
METHODS: Brain MR imaging studies that included ADC maps were retrospectively reviewed in 32 patients with histologically proved cerebellar neoplasm. There were 17 juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPA), 8 medulloblastomas, 5 ependymomas, and 2 rhabdoid (atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor ATRT) tumors. Absolute ADC values of contrast-enhancing solid tumor regions and ADC ratios (ADC of solid tumor to ADC of normal-appearing white matter) were compared with the histologic diagnosis. ADC values and ratios of JPAs, medulloblastomas, and ependymomas were compared by using a 2-tailed t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).; RESULTS: ADC values were significantly higher in pilocytic astrocytomas (1.65 +- 0.27) (mean +- SD) than in ependymomas (1.10 +- 0.11) (P = .0003) and medulloblastomas (0.66 +- 0.15) (P <.0001). Ependymomas demonstrated significantly higher ADC values than medulloblastomas (P =.0005). The observed differences were statistically significant on ANOVA (P <.001). ADC ratios were also significantly different among these 3 tumor types. ATRT ADC values were similar to medulloblastoma. The range of ADC values and ratios within JPAs and ependymomas did not overlap with that of medulloblastomas.; CONCLUSION: Assessment of ADC values of enhancing solid tumor is a simple and reliable technique for preoperative differentiation of cerebellar tumors in pediatric patients. Our cutoff values of > 1.4 X 10(3) mm(2)s for JPA and < 0.9 X 10(3) mm(2)s for medulloblastoma were 100% specific.

N2  -  Investigate whether patients on vigabatrin demonstrated new-onset and reversible T-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.
MRI of patients treated during vigabatrin therapy was reviewed, following detection of new basal ganglia, thalamus, and corpus callosum hyperintensities in an infant treated for infantile spasms. Patients were assessed for age at time of MRI, diagnosis, duration, and dose, MRI findings pre-, on, and postvigabatrin, concomitant medications, and clinical correlation. These findings were compared to MRI in patients with infantile spasms who did not receive vigabatrin.; Twenty-three patients were identified as having MRI during the course of vigabatrin therapy. After excluding the index case, we detected new and reversible basal ganglia, thalamic, brainstem, or dentate nucleus abnormalities in 7 of 22 (32%) patients treated with vigabatrin. All findings were reversible following discontinuation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was positive with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps demonstrating restricted diffusion. Affected versus unaffected patients, respectively, had a median age of 11 months versus 5 years, therapy duration 3 months versus 12 months, and dosage 170 mgkgday versus 87 mgkgday. All affected patients were treated for infantile spasms; none of 56 patients with infantile spasms who were not treated with vigabatrin showed the same abnormalities.; MRI abnormalities attributable to vigabatrin, characterized by new-onset and reversible T-2-weighted hyperintensities and restricted diffusion in thalami, globus pallidus, dentate nuclei, brainstem, or corpus callosum were identified in 8 of 23 patients. Young age and relatively high dose appear to be risk factors.

T2  -  TECHNIQUES IN NEUROSURGERY

N2  -  The progress of clinical neurologic sciences has depended on accurate cerebral localization and imaging technology. Over the past century, advances in cerebral imaging, including contrast angiography, pneumoencephalography, and, in more recent decades, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have revolutionized cerebral localization. Neurosurgery's dependence on imaging technology is epitomized by the recent flurry of intraoperative MRI (iMRI) systems developed to provide MR images during a neurosurgical procedure. Since 1996, multiple MR systems and related technologies have been developed, with more than 2,000 neurosurgical procedures performed worldwide. The systems possess magnet field strengths ranging from 0.12 to 1.5 Tesla, associated with varying degrees of intrusion into standard neurosurgical, anesthetic, and nursing procedures and protocols. A variety of brain and skull base tumors and vascular and spine lesions have been treated with remarkable precision and without adverse events. It is clear that with iMRI lesion targeting and resection are optimized while reoperation for residual lesion is avoided. Surgical techniques enhanced with iMRI are minimally invasive but maximally effective. With advanced MR capabilities such as diffusion and perfusion imaging, iMRI is a powerful research and teaching tool and may fundamentally change our understanding of surgical outcomes.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Turbo spin-echo diffusion-weighted imaging (TSE-DWI) has not been used for evaluating pituitary lesions. We compared the usefulness of TSE-DWI and echo-planar (EP)-DWI for assessing normal pituitary structures and lesions.
Materials and methods: Our study included 41 consecutive patients (27 pituitary adenomas, 8 Rathke's cleft cysts, 4 craniopharyngiomas, 1 germinoma, 1 pituitary metastasis) who underwent conventional pre- and post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and TSE- and EP-DWI at 3T. Two observers independently performed qualitative assessment of normal pituitary structures and lesions on sagittal DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. One observer recorded ADC values of normal brain structures and pituitary lesions. Kappa (kappa) statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, intraclass correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient and independent t-test were used for statistical analysis.; Results: Interobserver agreement for qualitative evaluations was good to excellent (kappa = 0.65-1.0). On both DWI and ADC maps, visualization of the pituitary gland, of the spatial relationship between the lesion and its normal surroundings, and the whole image quality were significantly better on TSE- than EP sequences (p < .01). In normal brain structures, the ADC value on TSE- and EP-sequences was significantly correlated (r = 0.6979, p < .05). The TSE-ADC value was significantly lower for pituitary adenomas than craniopharyngiomas (p < .05).; Conclusions: For the evaluation of normal pituitary structures and lesions, TSE-DWI is more useful than EP-DWI. The TSE-ADC value may help to differentiate between pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The ventral part of the precentral gyrus is considered one of the most eloquent areas. However, little is known about the white matter organization underlying this functional hub.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subcortical anatomy underlying the ventral part of the precentral gyrus, ie, the ventral precentral fiber intersection area (VPFIA).; METHODS: Eight human hemispheres from cadavers were dissected, and 8 healthy hemispheres were studied with diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The tracts that terminate at the ventral part of the precentral gyrus were isolated. In addition, 6 surgical cases with left side gliomas close to the VPFIA were operated awake with intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping.; RESULTS: The connections within the VPFIA are anatomically organized along an anteroposterior axis: the pyramidal pathway terminates at the anterior bank of the precentral gyrus, the intermediate part is occupied by the long segment of the arcuate fasciculus, and the posterior bank is occupied by the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus. Stimulation of the VPFIA elicited speech arrest in all cases.; CONCLUSION: The present study shows strong arguments to sustain that the fiber organization of the VPFIA is different fromthe classical descriptions, bringing new light for understanding the functional role of this area in language. The VPFIA is a critical neural epicenter within the perisylvian network that may represent the final common network for speech production, as it is strategically located between the termination of the dorsal stream and the motor output cortex that directly control speech muscles.

Patients with IVLBCL frequently develop neurological manifestations during their disease course. Patients are known to often develop various neurological manifestations, but there are only a few reports of IVLBCL whose initial symptoms are deafness and/or disequilibrium. Patient concerns: A 66-year-old Japanese man was provisionally diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Administration of prednisolone did not improve his symptoms, and then he experienced amaurosis fugax. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain infarcts, so he was administered antithrombotic drugs. Nevertheless, he experienced recurrent strokes, became irritable, and had visual hallucinations. He was emergently admitted to our hospital with disturbance of consciousness. Diagnosis: Blood tests showed elevation of lactose dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor. Cranial MR diffusion-weighted imaging showed multiple lesions bilaterally in the cerebral white matter and cortex, posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and cerebellar hemispheres, which were hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Hyperintense lesions were detected bilaterally in the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia on both T2-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI demonstrated contrast-enhancing high-signal lesions along the cerebral cortex. Brain biopsy revealed a diagnosis of IVLBCL. Interventions: The patient could not receive chemotherapy because of his poor general condition. Therefore, we administered high-dose methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy. Outcomes: There was little improvement in consciousness levels after the high-dose mPSL pulse therapy. On the forty-ninth day of hospitalization, he was transferred to another hospital to receive supportive care. Lessons: IVLBCL should be regarded as an important differential diagnosis of hearing loss and dizziness. Most importantly, if the symptoms are fluctuant and steroid therapy is not effective, biopsy should be considered as early as possible.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-We sought to map early regional ischemia and infarction in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and compare them with final infarct size using advanced MRI techniques, MRT can now delineate very early infarction by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and abnormal tissue perfusion by perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI).
Methods-Seventeen patients seen within 12 hours of onset of MCA stroke had MR angiography, standard MRI, and PWI and DWI MRI. PWI maps were generated by analysis of the passage of intravenous contrast bolus through the brain. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) was determined after quantitative analysis of PWI data, Volumes of the initial DWI and PWI lesion were calculated and compared with a final infarct volume from a follow-up imaging study (CT scan or MRI),; Results-Group 1 (10 patients) had MCA stem (M1) occlusion by MR angiography. DWI lesion volumes were smaller than the volumes of CBV abnormality. In 7 patients the final stroke volume was larger or the same, and in 3 it was smaller than the initial CBV lesion. Group 2 (7 patients) had an open M1 on MR angiography with distal MCA stroke. In 6 group 2 patients, the initial DWI lesion matched the initial CBV abnormality and the final infarct.; Conclusions-Most patients with M1 occlusion showed progression of infarction into the region of abnormal perfusion. In contrast, patients with open M1 had strokes consistent with distal branch occlusion and had maximal extent of injury on DWI at initial presentation, Application of these MRI techniques should improve definition of different acute stroke syndromes and facilitate clinical decision making.

N2  -  Background and purpose. - Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is a new technique that applies a three-diffusion-compartment biophysical model. We assessed the usefulness of NODDI for the differentiation of glioblastoma from solitary brain metastasis.
Methods. - NODDI data were prospectively obtained on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner from patients with previously untreated, histopathologically confirmed glioblastoma (n = 9) or solitary brain metastasis (n = 6). Using the NODDI Matlab Toolbox, we generated maps of the intra-cellular, extracellular, and isotropic volume (VIC, VEC, VISO) fraction. Apparent diffusion coefficient - and fraction anisotropy maps were created from the diffusion data. On each map we manually drew a region of interest around the peritumoral signal-change (PSC) - and the enhancing solid area of the lesion. Differences between glioblastoma and metastatic lesions were assessed and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was determined.; Results. - On VEC maps the mean value of the PSC area was significantly higher for glioblastoma than metastasis (P < 0.05); on VISO maps it tended to be higher for metastasis than glioblastoma. There was no significant difference on the other maps. Among the 5 parameters, the VEC fraction in the PSC area showed the highest diagnostic performance. The VEC threshold value of > 0.48 yielded 100% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, and an AUC of 0.87 for differentiating between the two tumor types.; Conclusions. - NODDI compartment maps of the PSC area may help to differentiate between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis.

N2  -  The authors report on the first case of corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings that mimicked those for lymphoma but with MR spectroscopy results absent of lymphoma characteristics. This 68-year-old man presented with rapid, progressive impairment in short-term memory as well as slow responses and a change in his personality within 3 weeks of admission. Results of cranial computed tomography revealed a slightly hyperdense corpus callosum tumor with bihemispheric involvement. Magnetic resonance images showed a homogeneous mass with strong enhancement. The mass showed water restriction on DW MR images and apparent-diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps but no markedly elevated lipid resonance on MR spectroscopy. The patient underwent tumor resection. Results of pathological studies with immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the lesion was GBM.
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging together with ADC mapping and MR spectroscopy was reported to be useful in differentiating GBM and primary brain lymphoma. The lymphomas were hyperintense to gray matter on DW MR images and isointense to hypointense on ADC maps because of water restriction. In contrast, the GBMs were hyperintense to gray matter on both DW MR images and ADC maps because of the T, shine-through effect. On MR spectroscopy, lipid resonance was markedly elevated in lymphoma but only slightly elevated in GBM.

N2  -  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive tool increasingly used for the investigation of brain connectivity in vivo. In this paper we propose a method that allows segmentation of the brainstem to four subregions (frontopontine, motor, sensory and reticular) based on connections to supratentorial structures, thereby eliminating the need for using anatomical landmarks within the brainstem for the identification of these subregions. The feasibility of connectivity-based brainstem segmentation was investigated in a group of healthy subjects (n = 20). Multifiber probabilistic tractography was performed using the FMRIB Software Library, and connections between a pontomesencephalic seed mask and four supratentorial target regions (anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, sensory and medial thalamus) were used to determine connectivity maps of the brainstem. Results were compared with a neuroanatomy atlas and histological sections, confirming good anatomic correspondence. The four subregions detected by the connectivity-based segmentation showed good intersubject reproducibility. The presented method may be a potential tool to investigate brainstem connectivity in diseases that distort normal anatomy, and quantitative analyses of the diffusion-related parameters may provide additional information on the involvement of brainstem pathways in certain disease states (e.g., traumatic brain injury, demyelinating disorders, brainstem tumors). The potential clinical applicability of the method is demonstrated in two cases of severe traumatic brain injury. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) is a major motor tract that transmits cortical input to the reticular formation motor nuclei and may be an important mediator of motor recovery after central nervous system damage. However, its cortical origins, trajectory and laterality are incompletely understood in humans. This study aimed to map the human CRP and generate an average CRP template in standard MRI space. Following recently established guidelines, we manually delineated the primary reticular formation motor nucleus (gigantocellular reticular nucleus [GRN]) using several group-mean MRI contrasts from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). CRP tractography was then performed with HCP diffusion-weighted MRI data (N = 1065) by selecting diffusion streamlines that reached both the cortex and GRN. Corticospinal tract (CST) tractography was also performed for comparison. Results suggest that the human CRP has widespread origins, which overlap with the CST across most of the motor cortex and include additional exclusive inputs from the medial and anterior prefrontal cortices. The estimated CRP projected through the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule before partially decussating in the midbrain tegmentum and converging bilaterally on the pontomedullary reticular formation. Thus, the CRP trajectory appears to partially overlap the CST, while being more distributed and anteromedial to the CST in the cerebrum before moving posterior to the CST in the brainstem. These findings have important implications for neurophysiologic testing, cortical stimulation and movement recovery after brain lesions. We expect that our GRN and tract maps will also facilitate future CRP research.

N2  -  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult intracranial malignancy and carries a dismal prognosis despite an aggressive multimodal treatment regimen that consists of surgical resection, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiographic evaluation, largely informed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a critical component of initial diagnosis, surgical planning, and post-treatment monitoring. However, conventional MRI does not provide information regarding tumor microvasculature, necrosis, or neoangiogenesis. In addition, traditional MRI imaging can be further confounded by treatment-related effects such as pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis, and/or pseudoresponse(s) that preclude clinicians from making fully informed decisions when structuring a therapeutic approach. A myriad of novel imaging modalities have been developed to address these deficits. Herein, we provide a clinically oriented review of standard techniques for imaging GBM and highlight emerging technologies utilized in disease characterization and therapeutic development.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Surgical treatment of convexity meningiomas is usually considered a low-risk procedure. Nevertheless, the risk of postoperative motor deficits is higher (7.1%-24.7% of all cases) for lesions located in the rolandic region, especially when an arachnoidal cleavage plane with the motor pathway is not identifiable. The authors analyzed the possible role of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) for planning resection of rolandic meningiomas and predicting the presence or lack of an intraoperative arachnoidal cleavage plane as well as the postoperative motor outcome.
METHODS Clinical data were retrospectively collected from surgical cases involving patients affected by convexity, parasagittal, or falx meningiomas involving the rolandic region, who received preoperative nTMS mapping of the motor cortex (M1) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract before surgery at 2 different neurosurgical centers. Surgeons' self-reported evaluation of the impact of nTMS-based mapping on surgical strategy was analyzed. Moreover, the nTMS mapping accuracy was evaluated in comparison with intraoperative neurophysiological mapping (IONM). Lastly, we assessed the role of nTMS as well as other pre-and intraoperative parameters for predicting the patients' motor outcome and the presence or absence of an intraoperative arachnoidal cleavage plane.; RESULTS Forty-seven patients were included in this study. The nTMS-based planning was considered useful in 89.3% of cases, and a change of the surgical strategy was observed in 42.5% of cases. The agreement of nTMS-based planning and IONM-based strategy in 35 patients was 94.2%. A new permanent motor deficit occurred in 8.5% of cases (4 of 47). A higher resting motor threshold (RMT) and the lack of an intraoperative arachnoidal cleavage plane were the only independent predictors of a poor motor outcome (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively). Moreover, a higher RMT and perilesional edema also predicted the lack of an arachnoidal cleavage plane (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Preoperative motor status, T2 cleft sign, contrast-enhancement pattern, and tumor volume had no predictive value.; CONCLUSIONS nTMS-based motor mapping is a useful tool for presurgical assessment of rolandic meningiomas, especially when a clear cleavage plane with M1 is not present. Moreover, the RMT can indicate the presence or absence of an intraoperative cleavage plane and predict the motor outcome, thereby helping to identify high-risk patients before surgery.

N2  -  Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) contributes significantly to mortality and morbidity following traumatic brain injury (TBI), but is poorly characterized by conventional imaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may provide better detection as well as insights into the mechanisms of white matter injury. DTI data from 33 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, acquired at a median of 32 h postinjury, were compared with data from 28 age-matched controls. The global burden of whole brain white matter injury (GB(WMI)) was quantified by measuring the proportion of voxels that lay below a critical fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold, identified from control data. Mechanisms of change in FA maps were explored using an Eigenvalue analysis of the diffusion tensor. When compared with controls, patients showed significantly reduced mean FA (P < 0.001) and increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; p = 0.017). GB(WMI) was significantly greater in patients than in controls (p < 0.01), but did not distinguish patients with obvious white matter lesions seen on structural imaging. It predicted classification of DTI images as head injury with a high degree of accuracy. Eigenvalue analysis showed that reductions in FA were predominantly the result of increases in radial diffusivity (p < 0.001). DTI may help quantify the overall burden of white matter injury in TBI and provide insights into underlying pathophysiology. Eigenvalue analysis suggests that the early imaging changes seen in white matter are consistent with axonal swelling rather than axonal truncation. This technique holds promise for examining disease progression, and may help define therapeutic windows for the treatment of diffuse brain injury.

N2  -  We evaluated the performance of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of breast cancer molecular subtypes. Ninety-one breast cancer patients who underwent 3T dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping were included retrospectively. Radiomic features were extracted from manually drawn regions of interest (n = 704 features per lesion) on initial DCE-MRI and ADC maps. The ten best features for subtype separation were selected using probability of error and average correlation coefficients. For pairwise comparisons with >20 patients in each group, a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was used (70% of cases for training, 30%, for validation, five times each). For all other separations, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and leave-one-out cross-validation were applied. Histopathology served as the reference standard. MLP-ANN yielded an overall median area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (0.77-0.92) for the separation of triple negative (TN) from other cancers. The separation of luminal A and TN cancers yielded an overall median AUC of 0.8 (0.75-0.83). Radiomics and AI from multiparametric MRI may aid in the non-invasive differentiation of TN and luminal A breast cancers from other subtypes.

N2  -  Different compositions of the extra cellular matrix with changing concentrations of more or less hydrophilic components like proteins may have a major influence on the diffusion phenomena found in gliomas.
24 patients (14 male  10 female) with histologically confirmed non necrotic glioma underwent preoperative MRI, including magnetisation transfer (MTR), triple echo T2 weighted (T2W) and diffusion weighted (DWI) sequences. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), quantitative T2 and MTR maps were calculated and regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the tumour centre (TU) and in the contralateral hemisphere (NWM). Informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the local ethic comity.; Mean values evaluated in the NWM  TU were (+- standard deviation); ADC: 0.78 (+- 0.08) x 10-3 mm2s  1.32 (+- 0.27) x 10-3 mm2s, T2: 101.66 (+- 12.00) ms  252.11 (+- 104.53) ms, MTR: 0.52 (+- 0.01)  0.40 (+- 0.04). The mean value of each parameter correlated highly significant with the others (p < 0.01).; Our results suggest that macromolecules binding protons in their vicinity are a major determinant of proton diffusivity in brain tumours in addition to other factors such as mechanical barriers like membranes or the size of the extra-cellular space.

N2  -  The pattern and role of brain plasticity in stroke recovery has been incompletely characterized. Both ipsilesional and contralesional changes have been described, but it remains unclear how these relate to functional recovery. Our goal was to correlate brain activation patterns with tissue damage, hemodynamics, and neurologic status after temporary stroke, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Transverse relaxation time (T-2)-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and perfusion MRI were performed at days 1 (n = 7),3 (n = 7), and 14 (n = 7) after 2 hr unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Functional activation and cerebrovascular reactivity maps were generated from contrast-enhanced fMRI during forelimb stimulation and hypercapnia, respectively. Before MRI, rats were examined neurologically. We detected loss of activation responses in the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex, which was related to T-2 lesion size (r= -0.858 on day 3, r= -0.979 on day 14; p < 0.05). Significant activation responses in the contralesional hemisphere were detected at days 1 and 3. The degree of shift in balance of activation between the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, characterized by the laterality index, was linked to the T(c)ontralesional forelimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex at day 1 (r= -0.807 and 0.782, respectively; p < 0.05) and day 14 (r= -0.898 and -0.970, respectively; p < 0.05). There was no correlation between activation parameters and perfusion status or cerebrovascular reactivity. Finally, we found that the laterality index and neurologic status changed in parallel over time after stroke, so that when all time points were grouped together, neurologic status was inversely correlated with the laterality index (r= -0.571; p = 0.016). This study suggests that the degree of shift of activation balance toward the contralesional hemisphere early after stroke increases with the extent of tissue injury and that functional recovery is associated mainly with preservation or restoration of activation in the ipsilesional hemisphere.

N2  -  MRI is an important diagnostic tool for evaluation of myelin content in multiple sclerosis and other CNS diseases, being especially relevant for studies investigating remyelinating pharmacotherapies. In this study, we evaluated a new synthetic MRI-based myelin estimation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency as a treatable primary demyelinating disorder and compared this method with established diffusion tensor imaging in both methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency patients and healthy controls. This is the first synthetic MRI-based in vivo evaluation of treatment-associated remyelination. 1.5 T synthetic MRI and 3 T diffusion MRI were obtained from three methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency patients at baseline and 6 months after therapy initiation, as well as from age-matched healthy controls (diffusion tensor imaging: n = 14, synthetic MRI: n = 9). Global and regional synthetic MRI parameters (myelin volume fraction, proton density, and relaxation rates) were compared with diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean/radial/axial diffusivity) and related to healthy controls by calculating z-scores and z-deviation maps. Whole-brain myelin (% of intracranial volume) of the index patient was reduced to 6 versus 10% in healthy controls, which recovered to a nonetheless subnormal level of 6.6% following initiation of high-dosage betaine. Radial diffusivity was higher at baseline compared with healthy controls (1.34 versus 0.79 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), recovering at follow-up (1.19 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). The index patient's lesion volume diminished by 58% under treatment. Regional analysis within lesion area and atlas-based regions revealed lower mean myelin volume fraction (12.7(Baseline)/14.71(Follow-up)%) and relaxation rates, higher proton density, as well as lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 x 10(Baseline)(-3)/0.94 x 10(Follow-up)(-3)) compared with healthy controls. The highest z-scores were observed for myelin volume fraction in the posterior thalamic radiation, with greater deviation from controls at baseline and reduced deviation at follow-up. Z-deviations of diffusion metrics were less pronounced for radial and mean diffusivity than for myelin volume fraction. Z-maps for myelin volume fraction of the index patient demonstrated high deviation within and beyond lesion areas, among others in the precentral and postcentral gyrus, as well as in the cerebellum, and partial remission of these alterations at follow-up, while radial diffusivity demonstrated more widespread deviations in supra- and infratentorial regions. Concordant changes of myelin volume fraction and radial diffusivity after treatment initiation, accompanied by dramatic clinical and paraclinical improvement, indicate the consistency of the methods, while myelin volume fraction seems to characterize remyelinated regions more specifically. Synthetic MRI-based myelin volume fraction provides myelin estimation consistent with changes of diffusion metrics to monitor short-term myelin changes on individual patient level.
Schneider et al. examined remyelination in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency by use of longitudinal myelin estimation based on synthetic MRI, which they compared with metrics derived from diffusion MRI. They suggested that synthetic MRI is suitable to measure short-term myelin changes in CNS diseases on individual patient level.

N2  -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is most commonly confused with high grade glial tumors. One third of all cases were misdiagnosed with neuroradiological procedures. The recommended treatment modality is chemotherapy and radiotherapy in contrary to high grade gliomas. It is important to differentiate lymphoma and high grade glial tumors. The latest studies demonstated the beneficial role of advanced neuroradiological procedures like diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), apparent difusion coefficient map (ADC) and spectroscopy. The cranial MRI study with conventional sequences showed a mass lesion which invaded the corpus callosum and the ventricule in a 70-year old man. It was hyperintense on DWI images compared to white matter and iso- mildly hypointense on ADC map. There was a decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and creatine peak and an increase in the choline peak. A remarkable lipid peak was present. The differential diagnosis included lymphoma primarily. The diagnosis was diffuse B cell lymphoma after histopathological evaluation. Our purpose in this study is to emphasize the importance of DWI, ADC map and spectroscopy in addition to conventional MRI sequences.

N2  -  Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest and most common brain tumor in adults, with poor survival and response to aggressive therapy. Limited access of drugs to tumor cells is one reason for such grim clinical outcomes. A driving force for therapeutic delivery is interstitial fluid flow (IFF), both within the tumor and in the surrounding brain parenchyma. However, convective and diffusive transport mechanisms are understudied. In this study, we examined the application of a novel image analysis method to measure fluid flow and diffusion in GBM patients. Methods: Here, we applied an imaging methodology that had been previously tested and validated in vitro, in silico, and in preclinical models of disease to archival patient data from the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (GAP) dataset. The analysis required the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), which is readily available in the database. The analysis results, which consisted of IFF flow velocity and diffusion coefficients, were then compared to patient outcomes such as survival. Results: We characterized IFF and diffusion patterns in patients. We found strong correlations between flow rates measured within tumors and in the surrounding parenchymal space, where we hypothesized that velocities would be higher. Analyzing overall magnitudes indicated a significant correlation with both age and survival in this patient cohort. Additionally, we found that neither tumor size nor resection significantly altered the velocity magnitude. Lastly, we mapped the flow pathways in patient tumors and found a variability in the degree of directionality that we hypothesize may lead to information concerning treatment, invasive spread, and progression in future studies. Conclusions: An analysis of standard DCE-MRI in patients with GBM offers more information regarding IFF and transport within and around the tumor, shows that IFF is still detected post-resection, and indicates that velocity magnitudes correlate with patient prognosis.

N2  -  Recent advances are allowing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to add diagnostic information derived from microscopic-scale brain structure, pathology, and physiology to the gross pathologic information that has been the core of brain imaging diagnosis since the 1980s. Physiologic imaging with MR perfusion weighted imaging has joined MR diffusion imaging as an essential components of stroke and brain tumor MRI. At the same time, the volume scanning revolution in CT technology has dramatically decreased the radiation doses required for CT perfusion imaging by allowing routine simultaneous CT perfusion and noninvasive dynamic bone subtracted CT angiography (CTA) without a significant increase in radiation dose over conventional head CT-CTA alone. Although ongoing research and clinical trials is needed to define more precisely how these techniques can best be exploited to improve clinical care and patient outcomes, in the acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage populations the radiation risk associated with CT perfusion imaging is negligible and the physiologic information promises significant patient safety benefits.

N2  -  Glioma segmentation is believed to be one of the most important stages of treatment management. Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols have led to a renewed interest in using automatic glioma segmentation with different MRI image weights. U-Net is a major area of interest within the field of automatic glioma segmentation. This paper examines the impact of different input MRI image-weight on the U-Net output performance for glioma segmentation. One hundred forty-nine glioma patients were scanned with a 1.5T MRI scanner. The main MRI image-weights acquired are diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) weighted images (b50, b500, b1000, Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, Exponential apparent diffusion coefficient (eADC) map), anatomical image-weights (T-2, T-1, T-2-FLAIR), and post enhancement image-weights (T1Gd). The U-Net and data augmentation are used to segment the glioma tumors. Having the Dice coefficient and accuracy enabled us to compare our results with the previous study. The first set of analyses examined the impact of epoch number on the accuracy of U-Net, and n_epoch = 20 was selected for U-Net training. The mean Dice coefficient for b50, b500, b1000, ADC map, eADC map, T-2, T-1, T-2-FLAIR, and T1Gd image weights for glioma segmentation with U-Net were calculated 0.892, 0.872, 0.752, 0.931, 0.944, 0.762, 0.721, 0.896, 0.694 respectively. This study has found that, DWI image-weights have a higher diagnostic value for glioma segmentation with U-Net in comparison with anatomical image-weights and post enhancement image-weights. The results of this investigation show that ADC and eADC maps have higher performance for glioma segmentation with U-Net.

N2  -  Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques provide physiologic information that complements the anatomic information available from conventional MR imaging. We evaluated the roles of diffusion and perfusion imaging for the assessment of grade and type of histologically proven intraaxial brain tumors. A total of 28 patients with intraaxial brain tumors underwent conventional MR imaging (T2- and T1-weighted sequences after gadobenate dimeglumine injection), diffusion imaging and T2*-weighted echo-planar perfusion imaging. Examinations were performed on 19 patients during initial diagnosis and on nine patients during follow-up therapy. Determinations of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed in the solid parts of each tumor, peritumoral region and contralateral white matter. For gliomas, rCBV values were greater in high-grade than in low-grade tumors (3.87 +/- 1.94 versus 1.30 +/- 0.42) at the time of initial diagnosis. rCBV values were increased in all recurrent tumors, except in one patient who presented with a combination of recurrent glioblastoma and massive radionecrosis on histology. Low-grade gliomas had low rCBV even in the presence of contrast medium enhancement. Differentiation between high- and low-grade gliomas was not possible using diffusion-weighted images and ADC values alone. In the peritumoral areas of untreated high-grade gliomas and metastases, the mean rCBV values were higher for high-grade gliomas (1.7 +/- 0.37) than for metastases (0.54 +/- 0.18) while the mean ADC values were higher for metastases. The rCBV values of four lymphomas were low and the signal intensity-time curves revealed a significant increase in signal intensity after the first pass of gadobenate dimeglumine. Diffusion and perfusion imaging, even with relatively short imaging and data processing times, provide important information for lesion characterization.

N2  -  Objective: To compare apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of brain segments by using two diffusion-weighted imaging acquisition modes, single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) and read-out-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-EPI), and to assess their correlation and agreement in healthy controls.
Materials and Methods: T2-weighted (T2W) images, rs-EPI, and ss-EPI of 30 healthy subjects were acquired using a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. The T2W images were co-registered to the rs-EPI and ss-EPI, which were then segmented into the gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to generate masking templates. ADC maps of rs-EPI and ss-EPI were also segmented into the GM, WM, and CSF by using the generated templates. ADCs of rs-EPI and ss-EPI were compared using Student's t tests and correlated using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between acquisitions.; Results: ADCs of rs-EPI and ss-EPI were significantly different in the GM (p < 0.001) and WM (p < 0.001). ADCs showed high agreement and correlation in the whole brain and CSF (r > 0.988; p < 0.001). ADC of the WM showed the least correlation (r = 0.894; p < 0.001), and ADCs of the WM and GM showed poor agreement. Pearson's correlation equations for each brain segment were y = 1.1x - 59.4 (GM), y = 1.45x - 255 (WM), and y = 0.98x - 63.5 (CSF), where x and y indicated ADCs of rs-EPI and ss-EPI, respectively.; Conclusion: While ADCs of rs-EPI and ss-EPI showed high correlation and agreement in the whole brain and CSF, ADCs of the WM and GM showed significant differences and large variability, reflecting brain parenchymal inhomogeneity due to different regional microenvironments. ADCs of different acquisition methods should be interpreted carefully, especially in intra-individual comparisons.

N2  -  Blastomycosis is a systemic mycotic infection caused by dimorphic fungi. The disease is rare in cats, and reports on imaging findings with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are limited. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed antemortem in three feline patients. Imaging findings that may allow prioritization of intracranial blastomycosis over other differential diagnoses included focal or multifocal intra-axial mass lesions with dural contact, lesion hypointensity on T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient map (DWI/ADC), strong and homogeneous contrast enhancement of the lesion(s), concurrent meningeal enhancement, marked perilesional edema and mass-effect, and ocular abnormalities. One cat was managed successfully and had a recurrence of CNS blastomycosis more than 4.5 years after the initial diagnosis. Repeat MRI at that point revealed both new and persistent (chronic) abnormalities.

N2  -  Objective Using neuroimaging, we analyzed the nature of extensive brain lesions in five anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.
Results Extensive brain lesions involved white matter in three, and basal ganglia and corpus callosum in one each. Four patients showed high diffusivity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps and three demonstrated increased cholinecreatine ratios and decreased N-acetyl-aspartatecreatine ratios on H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These findings suggested that the lesions were vasogenic edema associated with inflammation. Unusual brain symptoms associated with such lesions included recurrent limbic encephalitis, parkinsonism, and coma.; Conclusion Anti-AQP4 antibody is considered to be associated with the neuroimaging appearances of vasogenic edema.

N2  -  Objective To develop a nomogram based on MRI radiomics and clinical features for preoperatively predicting H3K27M mutation in pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) with a midline location of the brain. Methods The institutional database was reviewed to identify patients with pHGGs with a midline location of the brain who underwent tumor biopsy with preoperative MRI scans between June 2016 and June 2021. A total of 107 patients with pHGGs, including 79 patients with H3K27M mutation, were consecutively included and randomly divided into training and test sets. Radiomics features were extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted (DW) and post-contrast T1-weighted images, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression were performed for radiomics signature construction. Clinical and radiological features were analyzed to select clinical predictors. A nomogram was then developed by incorporating the radiomics signature and selected clinical predictors. Results Nine radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, which showed a favorable discriminatory ability in training and test sets with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. Ring enhancement was identified as an independent clinical predictor (p < 0.01). The nomogram, constructed with radiomics signature and ring enhancement, showed good calibration and discrimination in training and testing sets (AUC: 0.95 and 0.90 respectively). Conclusions The nomogram which combined radiomics signature and ring enhancement had a satisfactory ability to predict H3K27M mutation in pHGGs with a midline of the brain.

N2  -  Techniques for human brain imaging have undergone rapid developments in recent years. Technological progress has enabled the assessment of many physiological parameters in vivo that are highly relevant for tumour grading, tissue characterisation, definition of the extent and infiltration of tumours, and planning and monitoring of therapy. In this review, we provide a brief overview of advanced MRI and molecular-tracer techniques that have many potential clinical uses. A broad range of techniques, including dynamic MRI, PET, and single photon emission computed tomography, provide measurements of various features of tumour blood flow and microvasculature. Using PET to measure glucose consumption enables visualisation of tumour metabolism, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques provide complementary information on energy metabolism. Changes in protein and DNA synthesis can be assessed through uptake of labelled amino acids and nucleosides. Advanced imaging techniques can be used to assess tumour malignancy, extent, and infiltration, and might provide diagnostic clues to distinguish between lesion types and between recurrent tumour and necrosis. Stereotactic biopsies should be taken from the most malignant part of tumours, which can be identified by changes in microvascular structure and metabolic activity. Functional and metabolic imaging can improve the planning and monitoring of radiation and chemotherapy and contribute to the development of new therapies.

N2  -  The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network is an ongoing multi-center collaborative research group established to conduct integrated studies in participants with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS). The goal of these investigations is to provide new insights into the etiology, natural history, clinical, demographic and behavioral characteristics, search for new and evaluate candidate biomarkers, systematically test for contributions of infectious agents to symptoms, and conduct animal studies to understand underlying mechanisms for UCPPS. Study participants were enrolled in a one-year observational study and evaluated through a multisite, collaborative neuroimaging study to evaluate the association between UCPPS and brain structure and function. 3D T1-weighted structural images, resting-state fMRI, and high angular resolution diffusion MRI were acquired in five participating MAPP Network sites using 8 separate MRI hardware and software configurations. We describe the neuroimaging methods and procedures used to scan participants, the challenges encountered in obtaining data from multiple sites with different equipment/software, and our efforts to minimize site-to-site variation.

N2  -  In this study, we aimed to assess the detection of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) following stroke by perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PW-MRI) in comparison with positron emission tomography (PET). Both PW-MRI and 15O-water-PET were performed in acute and subacute hemispheric stroke patients. The degree of CCD was defined by regions of interest placed in the cerebellar hemispheres ipsilateral (I) and contralateral (C) to the supratentorial lesion. An asymmetry index (AI = C/I) was calculated for PET-cerebral blood flow (CBF) and MRI-based maps of CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP). The resulting AI values were compared by Bland-Altman (BA) plots and receiver operating characteristic analysis to detect the degree and presence of CCD. A total of 26 imaging procedures were performed (median age 57 years, 20/26 imaged within 48 hours after stroke). In BA plots, all four PW-MRI maps could not reliably reflect the degree of CCD. In receiver operating characteristic analysis for detection of CCD, PW-CBF performed poorly (accuracy 0.61), whereas CBV, MTT, and TTP failed (accuracy < 0.60). On the basis of our findings, PW-MRI at 1.5 T is not suited to depict CCD after stroke.

N2  -  There is an urgent need for ways to improve our understanding of poststroke recovery to inform the development of novel rehabilitative interventions, and improve the clinical management of stroke patients. Supported by the notion that predictive information on poststroke recovery is embedded not only in the individual brain regions, but also the connections throughout the brain, majority of previous investigations have focused on the relationship between brain functional connections and post-stroke deficit and recovery. However, considering the fact that it is the static anatomical brain connections that constrain and facilitate the dynamic functional brain connections, the microstructures and structural connections of the brain may potentially be better alternatives to the functional MRI-based biomarkers of stroke recovery. This review, therefore, seeks to provide an overview of the basic concept and applications of two recently proposed advanced diffusion MRI techniques, namely lesion network mapping and fixel-based morphometry, that may be useful for the investigation of stroke recovery at the local and global levels of the brain. This review will also highlight the application of some of other emerging advanced diffusion MRI techniques that warrant further investigation in the context of stroke recovery research.

N2  -  Gliomas are the most common form of central nervous system tumor. The most prevalent form, glioblastoma multiforme, is also the most deadly with mean survival times that are less than 15 months. Therapies are severely limited by the ability of these tumors to develop resistance to both radiation and chemotherapy. Thus, new tools are needed to identify and monitor chemoresistance before and after the initiation of therapy and to maximize the initial treatment plan by identifying patterns of chemoresistance prior to the start of therapy. Here we show how magnetic resonance imaging, particularly sodium imaging, metabolomics, and genomics have all emerged as potential approaches toward the identification of biomarkers of chemoresistance. This work also illustrates how use of these tools together represents a particularly promising approach to understanding mechanisms of chemoresistance and the development individualized treatment strategies for patients.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To compare findings with different magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion maps in acute ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Combined diffusion-weighted (DW) and perfusion-weighted (PW) MR imaging was performed in 49 patients with acute (<24 hours) stroke, on the ist and 2nd days and 1 week after stroke. Volumes of hypoperfused tissue on maps of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and mean transit time (MTT) were compared with the volume of infarcted tissue at DW imaging.; RESULTS: The mean infarct Volume increased from 41 to 65 cm(3) between the ist and 2nd days (P < .001; n = 49). On the 7st day, all perfusion maps on average showed hypoperfusion lesions larger than the infarct at DW imaging (P < .001; n = 49). MTT maps showed significantly (P < .001) larger hypoperfusion lesions than did rCBF maps, which showed significantly (P < .001) larger hypoperfusion lesions than did rCBV maps. The sizes of the initial perfusion-diffusion mismatches correlated significantly with the extent of infarct growth (0.479 < r < 0.657; P <less than or equal to> .001). The hypoperfusion volume on the initial rCBV maps correlated best with the final infarct size at 1 week (r = 0.891; P < .001).; CONCLUSION: Combined DW and PW imaging is a powerful tool in evaluating the hemodynamics of acute ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Objective To determine the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging to guide stereotactic biopsy for the diagnosis of intracranial angiitis. Case presentation In a 28-year-old woman who had experienced inactive headache and right limbs numbness for 4 days, preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) scanning, enhanced scanning, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ADC image scanning were performed. Stereotactic biopsy was performed in one target where the area of edema detected with MR FLAIR, and two targets where the area shown as a high-value and a lower value area in the DWI/ADC image. Pathological examinations together with computed tomographic and enhanced MRI scans were conducted after surgery. A preoperative enhanced MRI scan showed a uniform low-intensity lesion in the patient's left centrum semiovale, with a volume of 3.1 cm(3). The DWI and ADC images showed uneven high-intensity signals and different ADC values in the lesion area, respectively. During surgery, tissues around the lesion and the lesion center were sampled at the three selected targets. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was primary angiitis of the central nervous system, and the patient was given anti-inflammatory medication and hormone therapy. The 3-year follow-up confirmed that the patient had recovered well, with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of five. Conclusion DW-MRI and ADC images can be reliably used to determine the location of small intracranial lesions, and guide stereotactic biopsy to facilitate the diagnosis of primary vasculitis of the central nervous system.

N2  -  Objectives: Electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ECSM) is the current gold standard functional mapping technique; however, it is burdened by several limitations. Our objective in this study is to show that extended functional mapping modalities can (1) allow neurosurgeons to map and preserve eloquent regions that are inaccessible by the traditional ECSM technique and (2) factor into the operative decision-making process and surgical trajectory during resection of Rolandic brain tumors.
Patients and methods: A 55 year old patient having a right Rolandic glioblastoma underwent subdural grid implantation followed by surgical resection. Multimodal functional mapping including electrical stimulation, high gamma power mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging were performed to define the location of the patient's eloquent cortex and white matter tracts in relation to the tumor and determine the optimal surgical trajectory prior to resection.; Results: The patient tolerated a safe surgical resection without any new postoperative deficits. ECSM mapping successfully delineated safe areas for resection as well as eloquent areas related to motor control and speech production. High gamma power analysis successfully mapped areas involved in arm reach. Functional MRI showed the regions related to finger tapping. DTI demonstrated the corticospinal tract and its relation to the hand motor cortex and the tumor.; Conclusion: Adjunct mapping techniques used to supplement the data offered by ECSM can help advance the field of functional mapping and Rolandic surgery via broadening our accessibility to the human brain and providing a comprehensive map of eloquent grey and white matter structures and their relation to the tumor.

N2  -  Background: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of integrating the blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data into radiation treatment planning for high-grade gliomas located near the primary motor cortexes (PMCs) and corticospinal tracts (CSTs).
Methods: A total of 20 patients with high-grade gliomas adjacent to PMCs and CSTs between 2012 and 2014 were recruited. The bilateral PMCs and CSTs were located in the normal regions without any overlapping with target volume of the lesions. BOLD-fMRI, DTI and conventional MRI were performed on patients (Karnofsky performance score >= 70) before radical radiotherapy treatment. Four different imaging studies were conducted in each patient: a planning computed tomography (CT), an anatomical MRI, a DTI and a BOLD-fMRI. For each case, three treatment plans (3DCRT, IMRT and IMRT_PMC&CST) were developed by 3 different physicists using the Pinnacle planning system.; Results: Our study has shown that there was no significant difference between the 3DCRT and IMRT plans in terms of dose homogeneity, but IMRT displayed better planning target volume (PTV) dose conformity. In addition, we have found that the Dmax and Dmean to the ipsilateral and contralateral PMC and CST regions were considerably decreased in IMRT_PMC&CST group (p < 0.001).; Conclusions: In conclusion, integration of BOLD-fMRI and DTI into radiation treatment planning is feasible and beneficial. With the assistance of the above-described techniques, the bilateral PMCs and CSTs adjacent to the target volume could be clearly marked as OARs and spared during treatment.

N2  -  Background and Purpose We have previously shown that treatment with glutamate receptor antagonists after focal ischemia can partially reverse acute lesions measured with diffusion-weighted MRI. The goal of this study was to examine the quantitative nature of these effects of neuroprotection.
Methods Rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery under halothane anesthesia and treated with 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) (30 mgkg IP; two doses given immediately after ischemia and 1 hour after ischemia) or given injections of saline. Diffusion-weighted MRI scans were performed to map the changes in water diffusivity during the first 3 hours after ischemia. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) within the ischemic hemisphere were calculated, and ischemic changes were expressed as absolute reductions and as a percentage of contralateral mean values. Relative perfusion deficits in the ischemic hemisphere were assessed with dynamic MRI of transient changes in transverse relaxation rates (Delta R2*).; Results Analysis with ADC probability distribution functions showed that focal ischemia was present with gradients in ADC reductions emanating from the center to the periphery of the lesion. Ischemic evolution in control rats was manifested as a progressive shift of the probability distribution functions over time. NBQX treatment resulted in a reverse shift of these probability functions. By 3 hours after occlusion, probability distribution functions were significantly improved in treated rats (P<.05). Because of the temporal evolution of the probability distribution functions, ADC thresholds that correlated with histological outcomes of infarction changed over time. NBQX did not alter the cerebral perfusion index, measured as Delta R2* peak values.; Conclusions The results indicate that ADC probability distribution functions can be used to quantitatively evaluate the effects of neuroprotective treatment on the gradients of injury in focal cerebral ischemia. The probability functions also allow for intrasubject comparisons and may therefore be useful for exploring therapeutic windows.

N2  -  Objective: Common contrast-enhancing malignant tumors of the brain are glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs), anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs), metastases, and lymphomas, all of which have sometimes similar conventional MRI findings. Our aim was to evaluate the role of perfusion MR imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the differentiation of these contrast-enhancing malignant cerebral tumors.
Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with contrast-enhancing and histologically proven brain tumors, 14 AAs, 17 GBMs, nine metastases, and eight lymphomas, were included in the study. All patients have undergone routine MR examination where DWI and PWI were performed in the same session. DWI was performed with b values of 0, 500, and 1000 mm(2)s. Minimum ADC values (ADC(min)) of each tumor was later calculated from ADC map images. PWI was applied using dynamic susceptibility contrast technique and maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV(max)) was calculated from each tumor, given in ratio with contralateral normal white matter. Comparisons of ADC(min) and rCBV(max), values with the histological types of the enhancing tumors were made with a one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni test. A P value less than 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.; Results: The ADC(min) values (mean +- S.D.) in GBMs, AAs, lymphomas, and metastases were 0.79 +- 0.21 (X 10(-3) mm(2)s), 0.75 +- 0.21 (X 10(-3) mm(2)s), 0.51 +- 0.09 (X 10(-3) mm(2)s), and 0.68 +- 0.11 (X 10(-3) mm(2)s),respectively. The difference in ADC(min) values were statistically significant between lymphomas and GBMs (P < 0.05). It was also statistically significant between lymphomas and AAs (P < 0.03). However, there were no differences between lymphomas and metastasis, and between GBMs, AAs, and metastasis. The rCBV(max), ratio (mean S.D.) in GBMs were 6.33 +- 2.03, whereas it was 3.66 +- 1.79 in AAs, 2.33 +- 0.68 in lymphomas, and 4.45 +- 1.87 in metastases. These values were statistically different between GBMs and AAs (P < 0.001), GBMs and lymphoma (P < 0.0001). Although there seemed to be difference between GBMs and metastases, it was not statistically significant (P < 0.083).; Conclusion: Combination of DWI and PWI, with ADC(min) and rCBV(max) calculations, may aid routine MR imaging in the differentiation of common cerebral contrast-enhancing malignant tumors.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has been used in neurosurgical practice mainly to distinguish cerebral metastases from abscess and glioma. There is evidence from other solid organ cancers and metastases that DWI may be used as a biomarker of prognosis and treatment response. We therefore investigated DWI characteristics of cerebral metastases and their peritumoral region recorded pre-operatively and related these to patient outcomes.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of 76 cases operated upon at a single institution with DWI performed pre-operatively at 1.5T. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were generated using standard protocols. Readings were taken from the tumor, peritumoral region and across the brain-tumor interface. Patient outcomes were overall survival and time to local recurrence.; Results: A minimum ADC greater than 919.4 x 10(-6) mm(2)s within a metastasis predicted longer overall survival regardless of adjuvant therapies. This was not simply due to differences between the types of primary cancer because the effect was observed even in a subgroup of 36 patients with the same primary, non-small cell lung cancer. The change in diffusion across the tumor border and into peritumoral brain was measured by the "ADC transition coefficient" or ATC and this was more strongly predictive than ADC readings alone. Metastases with a sharp change in diffusion across their border (ATC >0.279) showed shorter overall survival compared to those with a more diffuse edge. The ATC was the only imaging measurement which independently predicted overall survival in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 - 0.97, p = 0.04).; Conclusions: DWI demonstrates changes in the tumor, across the tumor edge and in the peritumoral region which may not be visible on conventional MRI and this may be useful in predicting patient outcomes for operated cerebral metastases.

N2  -  PURPOSE We present SlicerDMRI, an open-source software suite that enables research using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), the only modality that can map the white matter connections of the living human brain. SlicerDMRI enables analysis and visualization of dMRI data and is aimed at the needs of clinical research users. SlicerDMRI is built upon and deeply integrated with 3D Slicer, a National Institutes of Health-supported open-source platform for medical image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional visualization. Integration with 3D Slicer provides many features of interest to cancer researchers, such as real-time integration with neuronavigation equipment, intraoperative imaging modalities, and multimodal data fusion. One key application of SlicerDMRI is in neurosurgery research, where brain mapping using dMRI can provide patient-specific maps of critical brain connections as well as insight into the tissue microstructure that surrounds brain tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS In this article, we focus on a demonstration of SlicerDMRI as an informatics tool to enable end-to-end dMRI analyses in two retrospective imaging data sets from patients with high-grade glioma. Analyses demonstrated here include conventional diffusion tensor analysis, advanced multifiber tractography, automated identification of critical fiber tracts, and integration of multimodal imagery with dMRI.; RESULTS We illustrate the ability of SlicerDMRI to perform both conventional and advanced dMRI analyses as well as to enable multimodal image analysis and visualization. We provide an overview of the clinical rationale for each analysis along with pointers to the SlicerDMRI tools used in each.; CONCLUSION SlicerDMRI provides open-source and clinician-accessible research software tools for dMRI analysis. SlicerDMRI is available for easy automated installation through the 3D Slicer Extension Manager. (c) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

N2  -  The advanced imaging techniques outlined in this article are only slowly establishing their place in surgical practice. Even a low risk of false information is unacceptable in neurosurgery, thus decision-making is necessarily conservative. As more validation studies and greater experience accrue, surgeons are becoming more comfortable weighing the quality of information from functional imaging studies. Advanced imaging information is highly complementary to established surgical "good practice" such as anatomic planning, awake craniotomy, and electrocortical stimulation; its greatest impact is perhaps on how neurosurgery is planned and discussed before the patient is ever brought to the operating room. Access to functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, diffusion tractography, and intraoperative MR imaging can influence neurosurgical decisions before, during, and after surgery. However, the widespread adoption of these techniques in neurosurgical practice remains limited by the lack of standardized methods, the need for validation across institutions, and the unclear cost-effectiveness particularly for intraoperative MR imaging. Before advanced imaging results can be used therapeutically, it is incumbent on the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist to develop a working understanding of each technique's strengths and weaknesses, positive and negative predictive values, and modes of failure. This content presents several imaging methods that are increasingly used in neurosurgical planning. As these techniques are progressively applied to surgery, radiologists, medical physicists, neuroscientists, and engineers will be necessary partners with the treating neurosurgeon to bridge the gap between the experimental and the therapeutic.

N2  -  The development of new MRI techniques in the last two decades has provided neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons with additional noninvasive imaging tools for management and treatment of brain tumors. When coupled with standard structural MR sequences in imaging brain tumors, Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI), Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) provide additional physiologic information that is very useful for differential diagnosis, presurgical planning and prognosis. In this review after a brief technical description of BOLD fMRI, PWI and DTI, studies are described from the literature that have extensively validated these imaging techniques in comparison with invasive "gold standard" techniques such as intraoperative electrical cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping or biopsy. Additional studies are mentioned that demonstrate the positive impact of BOLD fMRI, PWI and DTI on brain tumor treatment and clinical outcome. In the final section an interesting clinical case treated at our institution is presented that highlights the clinical utility of this integrated physiologic brain tumor imaging approach.

N2  -  The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger series a-re needed.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Lesion studies and recent surgical series report important sequelae when the inferior parietal lobe and posterior temporal lobe are damaged. Millions of axons cross through the white matter underlying these cortical areas; however, little is known about the complex organization of these connections.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subcortical anatomy of a specific region within the parietal and temporal lobes where 7 long-distances tracts intersect, ie, the temporoparietal fiber intersection area (TPFIA).; METHODS: Four postmortem human hemispheres were dissected, and 4 healthy hemispheres were analyzed through the use of diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography software. The different tracts that intersect at the posterior temporal and parietal lobes were isolated, and the relations with the surrounding structures were analyzed.; RESULTS: Seven tracts pass through the TPFIA: horizontal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, middle longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, optic radiations, and tapetum. The TPFIA was located deep to the angular gyrus, posterior portion of the supramarginal gyrus, and posterior portion of the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri.; CONCLUSION: The TPFIA is a critical neural crossroad; it is traversed by 7 white matter tracts that connect multiple areas of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. It is also a vulnerable part of the network in that a lesion within this area will produce multiple disconnections. This is valuable information when a surgical approach through the parieto-temporo-occipital junction is planned. To decrease surgical risks, a detailed diffusion tensor imaging tractography reconstruction of the TPFIA should be performed, and intraoperative electric stimulation should be strongly considered.

N2  -  Purpose: To establish high-frequency magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) as a novel contrast mechanism for the assessment of glioblastomas using a rat brain tumor model.
Methods: Six F98 intracranial tumor bearing rats were imaged longitudinally 8, 11 and 14 days after tumor cell inoculation. Conductivity and mean diffusivity maps were generated using MREPT and Diffusion Tensor Imaging. These maps were coregistered with T-2-weighted images and volumes of interests (VOIs) were segmented from the normal brain, ventricles, edema, viable tumor, tumor rim, and tumor core regions. Longitudinal changes in conductivity and mean diffusivity (MD) values were compared in these regions. A correlation analysis was also performed between conductivity and mean diffusivity values.; Results: The conductivity of ventricles, edematous area and tumor regions (tumor rim, viable tumor, tumor core) was significantly higher (P<.01) compared to the contralateral cortex. The conductivity of the tumor increased over time while MD from the tumor did not change. A marginal positive correlation was noted between conductivity and MD values for tumor rim and viable tumor, whereas this correlation was negative for the tumor core.; Conclusion: We demonstrate a novel contrast mechanism based on ionic concentration and mobility, which may aid in providing complementary information to water diffusion in probing the microenvironment of brain tumors.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Diabetes mellitus is a disease with vascular components. Consequently, the blood-brain barrier disruption after stroke may differ between diabetic and nondiabetic animals. However, few studies have documented the longitudinal blood-brain barrier disruption afte stroke in diabetic animals. In this study, using MRI, we noninvasively evaluated the blood-brain barrier damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion in diabetic and nondiabetic rats.
Methods-Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced in adult male Wistar rats by administration of a high-fat diet in combination with a single intraperitoneal injection (35 mgkg) of streptozotocin. T2DM rats (n=9) and nondiabetic wildtype (WT) rats (n=9) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hours using the filament model. MRI was performed 1 day and then weekly for 5 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion for all rats.; Results-The ischemic lesion volumes after stroke as measured using T-2 maps were not significantly different between the T2DM and WT rats. Compared with the WT rats, the volumes of blood-brain barrier disruption evaluated using contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid and the cerebral hemorrhagic volumes measured with susceptibility-weighted imaging were significantly (P<0.05) larger in the T2DM rats from 1 to 5 weeks after stroke; values of diffusion fractional anisotropy were significantly lower in T2DM rats (P<0.03) than in WT rats after stroke. These MRI measurements were consistent with histological data.; Conclusions-Using MRI, T-2-weighted imaging did not detect significant differences of the ischemic lesion volumes between T2DM and WT rats. In contrast to the WT rats, however, contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging identified much more severe ischemic vascular damage, whereas fractional anisotropy demonstrated lower axonal density in the T2DM rats after stroke.

N2  -  Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), iron rim lesions (IRLs) are characterized by progressive tissue matrix damage. Therefore, early identification could represent an interesting target for therapeutic intervention to minimize evolving tissue damage. The aim of this study was to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters predicting the conversion from contrast-enhancing to IRLs. Methods We retrospective identified MS patients scanned on the same 3 T MRI system presenting at least one supratentorial contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL) and a second MRI including susceptibility-weighted images after at least 3 months. On baseline MRI, pattern of contrast-enhancement was categorized as "nodular" or "ring-like", apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were assessed for the presence of a peripheral hypointense rim. Lesion localization, quantitative volumes (ADC, lesion volume) and the presence of a central vein were assessed. Results Eighty-nine acute contrast-enhancing lesions in 54 MS patients were included. On follow-up, 16/89 (18%) initially CELs converted into IRLs. CELs that converted into IRLs were larger and demonstrated significantly more often a ring-like contrast-enhancement pattern and a peripheral hypointense rim on ADC maps. Logistic regression model including the covariables pattern of contrast-enhancement and presence of a hypointense rim on ADC maps showed the best predictive performance (area under the curve = 0.932). Discussion The combination of a ring-like contrast-enhancement pattern and a peripheral hypointense rim on ADC maps has the ability to predict the evolution from acute to IRLs. This could be of prognostic value and become a target for early therapeutic intervention to minimize the associated tissue damage.

N2  -  Background: To compare the microstructural integrity of the corticospinal tract (CST) between glioma patients with motor epilepsy and without epilepsy using mean apparent propagator magnetic resonance imaging (MAP-MRI).
Methods: A total of 26 patients with glioma adjacent to the CST pathway (10 with motor epilepsy and 16 without epilepsy) and 13 matched healthy controls underwent brain structural and diffusion MRI. The morphological characteristics of the CST (tract volume, tract number, and average length) were extracted, and diffusion parameter values including mean squared displacement (MSD), q-space inverse variance (QIV), return-to-origin probability (RTOP), return-to-axis probabilities (RTAP), return-to-plane probabilities (RTPP), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) along the CST were evaluated. The CST features were compared between healthy and affected sides and the relative CST features were compared across the three groups of participants. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to assess the performance of each relative CST characteristic for glioma-induced CST changes.; Results: For patients without epilepsy, the tract number, tract volume, FA, RD, MSD, QIV, and RTAP changed significantly on the affected CST side compared with those on the healthy CST side (P=0.002, 0.002, 0.030 0.017, 0.039, 0.044, and 0.002, respectively). In contrast, for patients with motor epilepsy, no significant difference was found between the affected and healthy side in almost all CST features except RTPP (P=0.028). Compared with patients with motor epilepsy, the relative tract number, tract volume, AD, and RTAP were significantly lower (P=0.027, 0.018, 0.040, and 0.027, respectively) in patients without epilepsy, and their areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.763, 0.781, 0.744, and 0.763, respectively. No significant difference was found between patients with motor epilepsy and matched healthy controls.; Conclusions: The MAP-MRI is a promising approach for evaluating CST changes. It provides additional information reflecting the microstructural complexity of the CST and demonstrates the preserved microstructural integrity of the CST in glioma patients with motor epilepsy.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Fluorescein-guided surgery of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) increases the extent of tumor resection but its efficacy has been questioned, especially for tumors located close to functional networks. In these cases, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) may be used to plan and guide a safe resection. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these techniques combined with intraoperative neurophysiologic mapping (IONM) to achieve the maximal safe resection of tumors located in the motor area.
METHODS: We collected data of patients operated using a multimodal combination of sodium fluorescein-guided resection, nTMS motor planning, and IONM for HGGs in the motor area. The nTMS planning accuracy, extent of resection, and postoperative motor and functional status were compared with a matched control group of patients with HGG operated on only by IONM-guided resection.; RESULTS: Forty-one patients treated by multimodal approach (group A) and 41 controls (group B) were included. The nTMS-based planning reliably identified the tumormotor pathway spatial relationship (accuracy, 92.68%). We obtained in group A versus controls a higher gross total resection rate (73.17% vs. 51.22%; P = 0.04), and a reduction of cases with new permanent motor deficits (9.75% vs. 29.27%; P = 0.04) or Karnofsky Performance Status worsening (12.19% vs. 31.71%; P = 0.03).; CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the role of the combination of sodium fluorescein-guided resection and nTMS-based planning for surgery of HGGs close to the motor pathway. This multimodal approach in combination with IONM may lead to customized preoperative planning, increased extent of resection, and improved functional outcome, compared with standard IONM-guided surgery.

N2  -  To investigate the feasibility of simultaneously assessing cerebral blood volume and diffusion heterogeneity using hybrid diffusion-kurtosis (DK) and intravoxel-incoherent-motion (IVIM) MR imaging.
Fifteen healthy volunteers and 30 patients with histologically proven brain tumours (25 WHO grade II-IV gliomas and five metastases) were recruited. On a 3-T system, diffusion-weighted imaging was performed with six b-values ranging from 0 to 1,700 smm(2). Nonlinear least-squares fitting was employed to extract diffusion coefficient (D), diffusion kurtosis coefficient (K, a measure of the degree of non-Gaussian and heterogeneous diffusion) and intravascular volume fraction (f, a measure proportional to cerebral blood volume). Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed to assess the ability of DKf in differentiating contrast-enhanced tumour from peritumoral oedema and normal-appearing white matter.; Based on our imaging setting (baseline signal-to-noise ratio = 32-128), coefficient of variation was 14-20 % for K, similar to 6 % for D and 26-44 % for f. The indexes were able to differentiate contrast-enhanced tumour (Wilks' lambda = 0.026, p < 10(-3)), and performance was greatest with K, followed by f and D.; Hybrid DK IVIM imaging is capable of simultaneously measuring cerebral perfusion and diffusion indexes that together may improve brain tumour diagnosis.; aEuro cent Hybrid DK-IVIM imaging allows simultaneous measurement of K, D and f.; aEuro cent Combined KDf better demarcates contrast-enhanced tumour than they do separately.; aEuro cent f correlates better with contrast-leakage-corrected CBV (DSC) than with uncorrected CBV (DSC.).

N2  -  Diffusion MRI, although having the potential to be a biomarker for early assessment of tumor response to therapy, could be confounded by edema and necrosis in or near the brain tumors. This study aimed to develop and investigate the ability of the diffusion abnormality index (DAI) to be a new imaging biomarker for early assessment of brain metastasis response to radiation therapy (RT).
Patients with either radiosensitive or radioresistant brain metastases that were treated by whole brain RT alone or combined with bortezomib as a radiation sensitizer had diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI pre-RT and 2 weeks (2W) after starting RT. A patient-specific diffusion abnormality probability function (DAProF) was created to account for abnormal low and high apparent diffusion coefficients differently, reflecting respective high cellularity and edemanecrosis. The DAI of a lesion was then calculated by the integral of DAProF-weighted tumor apparent diffusion coefficient histogram. The changes in DAI from pre-RT to 2W were evaluated for differentiating the responsive, stable, and progressive tumors and compared with the changes in gross tumor volume and conventional diffusion metrics during the same time interval.; In lesions treated with whole brain RT, the DAI performed the best among all metrics in predicting the posttreatment response of brain metastases to RT. In lesions treated with whole brain RT bortezomib, although DAI was the best predictor, the performance of all metrics worsened compared with the first group.; The ability of DAI for early assessment of brain metastasis response to RT depends upon treatment regimes.

N2  -  The effectiveness of the radiosensitizer gemcitabine (GEM) was evaluated in a mouse glioma along with the imaging biomarker diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for early detection of treatment effects. A genetically engineered murine GBM model [Ink4a-Arf(-/-) Pten(loxP/loxP)/Ntv-a RCAS/PDGF(+)/Cre(+)] was treated with gemcitabine (GEM), temozolomide (TMZ) +/- ionizing radiation (IR). Therapeutic efficacy was quantified by contrast-enhanced MRI and DW-MRI for growth rate and tumor cellularity, respectively. Mice treated with GEM, TMZ and radiation showed a significant reduction in growth rates as early as three days post-treatment initiation. Both combination treatments (GEM/IR and TMZ/IR) resulted in improved survival over single therapies. Tumor diffusion values increased prior to detectable changes in tumor volume growth rates following administration of therapies. Concomitant GEM/IR and TMZ/IR was active and well tolerated in this GBM model and similarly prolonged median survival of tumor bearing mice. DW-MRI provided early changes to radiosensitization treatment warranting evaluation of this imaging biomarker in clinical trials.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Language-related networks have been recognized in functional maintenance, which has also been considered the mechanism of plasticity and reorganization in patients with cerebral malignant tumors. However, the role of interhemispheric connections (ICs) in language restoration remains unclear at the network level. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking data were used to identify language-eloquent regions and their corresponding subcortical structures, respectively.
METHODS Preoperative image-based IC networks and nTMS mapping data from 30 patients without preoperative and postoperative aphasia as the nonaphasia group, 30 patients with preoperative and postoperative aphasia as the glioma-induced aphasia (GIA) group, and 30 patients without preoperative aphasia but who developed aphasia after the operation as the surgery-related aphasia group were investigated using fully connected layer-based deep learning (FC-DL) analysis to weight ICs.; RESULTS GIA patients had more weighted ICs than the patients in the other groups. Weighted ICs between the left precuneus and right paracentral lobule, and between the left and right cuneus, were significantly different among these three groups. The FC-DL approach for modeling functional and structural connectivity was also tested for its potential to predict postoperative language levels, and both the achieved sensitivity and specificity were greater than 70%. Weighted IC was reorganized more in GIA patients to compensate for language loss.; CONCLUSIONS The authors' method offers a new perspective to investigate brain structural organization and predict functional prognosis.

N2  -  Purpose: To disentangle the free diffusivity (D-0) and cellular membrane restrictions, by means of their surface-to-volume ratio (S/V), using the frequency-dependence of the diffusion coefficient D(omega), measured in brain tumors in the short diffusion-time regime using oscillating gradients (OGSE).
Methods: In vivo and ex vivo OGSE experiments were performed on mice bearing the GL261 murine glioma model (n = 10) to identify the relevant timefrequency (tomega) domain where D(omega) linearly decreases with omega(-12). Parametric maps (SV, D-0) are compared with conventional DWI metrics. The impact of frequency range and temperature (20 degrees C versus 37 degrees C) on SV and D-0 is investigated ex vivo.; Results: The validity of the short diffusion-time regime is demonstrated in vivo and ex vivo. Ex vivo measurements confirm that the purely geometric restrictions embodied in SV are independent from temperature and frequency range, while the temperature dependence of the free diffusivity D-0 is similar to that of pure water.; Conclusion: Our results suggest that D(omega) in the short diffusion-time regime can be used to uncouple the purely geometric restriction effect, such as SV, from the intrinsic medium diffusivity properties, and provides a nonempirical and objective way to interpret frequencytime-dependent diffusion changes in tumors in terms of objective biophysical tissue parameters.

N2  -  Purpose: To illustrate the evolution of brain perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI-MRI) in severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy, and its possible relation to further neurodevelopmental outcome.
Materials and Methods: Two term neonates with HI encephalopathy underwent an early and a late MRI, including PWI They were followed until eight months of age. A total of three "normal controls" were also included. Perfusion maps were obtained, and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood volume (rCBV) values were measured.; Results: Compared to normal neonates, a hyperperfusion (increased rCBF and rCBV) was present on early scans in the whole brain. On late scans, hyperperfusion persisted in cortical gray matter (normalization of rCBF and rCBV ratios in white matter and basal ganglia, but not in cortical gray matter). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was normalized, and extensive lesions became visible on T2-weighted images. Both patients displayed very abnormal outcome: Patient 2 with the more abnormal early and late hyperperfusion being the worst.; Conclusion: PWI in HI encephalopathy did not have the same temporal evolution as DWI, and remained abnormal for more than one week after injury. This could be a marker of an ongoing mechanism underlying severe neonatal HI encephalopathy. Evolution of PWI might help to predict further neurodevelopmental outcome.

N2  -  Objectives To determine the diagnostic superiority of parametric response mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCPR) for predicting glioblastoma treatment response, compared to single time point measurement.
Methods Fifty post-treatment glioblastoma patients were enrolled. ADCPR was calculated from serial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps acquired before and at the time of first detection of an enlarged contrast-enhancing lesion on voxel-by-voxel basis. The percentage-decrease in ADCPR and tenth percentile histogram cutoff value of ADC (ADC10) were compared at subsequent 3-month and 1-year follow-ups.; Results The percentage-decrease in ADCPR was significantly higher in the progression group (mean = 33.2-38.3 %) than in the stable-response group (mean = 9.7 %) at 3 months follow-up (corrected p < 0.001 for both readers). ADCPR significantly improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.67 to 0.88 (corrected p = 0.037) and from 0.70 to 0.92 (corrected p = 0.020) for both readers, respectively, compared to ADC10 at 3-month follow-up, but did not significantly improve at 1-year follow-up. The inter-reader agreement was higher for ADCPR than ADC10 (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.93 versus 0.86).; Conclusion Voxel-based ADCPR appears to be a superior imaging biomarker than ADC, particularly for predicting early tumour progression in patients with glioblastoma.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in cerebral perfusion seen on mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps and to assess the subsequent prognostic value of the MTT-DWI (diffusion-weighted MRI) and CBV-DWI mismatch in the first three days of stroke on lesion enlargement and clinical outcome. In 38 patients, imaged 1-46 h after onset of symptoms, lesion volumes on proton-density (PD)-weighted MRI, DWI and PWI (both MTT and CBV maps) were compared with lesion volumes on follow-up PD-weighted scans, and to clinical outcome (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel index, and Rankin scale). The MTT-CBV, MTT-DWI and in lesion volume between initial and follow-up PD-weighted scans. Lesion volume on both DWI and PWI correlated significantly with clinical outcome parameters (p < 0.001) with strongest correlation for lesion volume on CBV. Perfusion-diffusion mismatches were found for both CBV and MTT and correlated significantly with lesion enlargement on PD-weighted imaging with strongest correlation for the CBV-DWI mismatch. The CBV-DWI mismatch has the highest accuracy in predicting lesion size on follow-up imaging and in predicting clinical outcome. Lesion volume measurements on CBV maps have a higher specificity than on PD-weighted, MTT or DWI images in predicting clinical follow-up imaging and in predicting clinical outcome.

N2  -  Backgrounds: Optic radiation protection is crucial in the basal temporal approach to the mesial temporal lobe. Clear description of the optic radiation in the basal brain surface is lacking. Our aim is to describe the anatomy of optic radiation in the basal cerebral surface and define safety zone of basal temporal approach avoiding of optic radiation injury. Methods: Five brain specimens (10 hemispheres) were dissected using Klingler method to observe the course of the optic radiation. Diffusion tensor imaging data of 25 volunteers were used to verify the fiber dissection results. The relationship of the optic radiation to nearby structures were illustrated and measured. Results: The optic radiation bends from the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle to its bottom at a basal turning point of optic radiation (bTPOR). The bTPOR is at the plane crossing the center point of the splenium of corpus callosum. MRI measurements showed no significant difference in the distance from the center of the splenium of corpus callosum and the bTPOR to the occipital pole (59.46 ? 4.338 mm vs 59.54 ? 3.805 mm, p = 0.95). Anterior to bTPOR, no optic radiation fibers were found at the basal brain surface. Conclusions: The bTPOR was found as a landmark of the optic radiation in the cerebral basal surface. With neuronavigation, the splenium of corpus callosum can be a landmark of the bTPOR. By approaching mesial temporal lesions using the basal temporal approach anterior to bTPOR, optic radiation injury can be prevented.

N2  -  Despite the increased diagnostic accuracy of contrast material enhanced MR imaging, specification and grading of brain tumors are still only approximate at best: neither morphology, nor relaxation times or contrast material enhancement reliably predict tumor histology or tumor grade. As histology and tumor grade strongly influence which therapy concept is chosen, a more precise diagnosis is mandatory. With diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI, PWI) it is now possible to obtain important information regarding the cellular matrix and the relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) of brain tumors, which cannot be obtained with standard MR techniques. These dynamic-functional imaging techniques are very useful in the preoperative diagnosis of gliomas, lymphomas, and metastases, as well as in the differentiation of these neoplastic lesions from abscesses, atypical ischemic infarctions, and tumor-like manifestations of demyelinating disease. Additionally, they appear suitable for determining glioma grade and regions of active tumor growth which should be the target of stereotactic biopsy and therapy. After therapy these techniques are helpful to better assess the tumor response to therapy, possible therapy failure and therapy complications such as radiation necrosis.

N2  -  The exquisite soft-tissue contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has meant that the technique is having an increasing role in contouring the gross tumor volume (GTV) and organs at risk (OAR) in radiation therapy treatment planning systems (TPS). MRI-planning scans from diagnostic MRI scanners are currently incorporated into the planning process by being registered to CT data. The soft-tissue data from the MRI provides target outline guidance and the CT provides a solid geometric and electron density map for accurate dose calculation on the TPS computer. There is increasing interest in MRI machine placement in radiotherapy clinics as an adjunct to CT simulators. Most vendors now offer 70 cm bores with flat couch inserts and specialised RF coil designs. We would refer to these devices as MR-simulators. There is also research into the future application of MR-simulators independent of CT and as in-room image-guidance devices. It is within the background of this increased interest in the utility of MRI in radiotherapy treatment planning that this paper is couched. The paper outlines publications that deal with standard MRI sequences used in current clinical practice. It then discusses the potential for using processed functional diffusion maps (fDM) derived from diffusion weighted image sequences in tracking tumor activity and tumor recurrence. Next, this paper reviews publications that describe the use of MRI in patient-management applications that may, in turn, be relevant to radiotherapy treatment planning. The review briefly discusses the concepts behind functional techniques such as dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI sequences and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Significant applications of MR are discussed in terms of the following treatment sites: brain, head and neck, breast, lung, prostate and cervix. While not yet routine, the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map analysis indicates an exciting future application for functional MRI. Although DW-MRI has not yet been routinely used in boost adaptive techniques, it is being assessed in cohort studies for sub-volume boosting in prostate tumors.

N2  -  T2' values reflect the presence of deoxyhaemoglobin related to high local oxygen extraction. We assessed the feasibility of T2' imaging to display regions with high metabolic activity in brain gliomas.
MRI was performed in 25 patients (12 female; median age 46 years; range 2-69) with brain gliomas with additional T2 and T2* sequences. T2' maps were derived from T2 and T2*. Dynamic susceptibility weighted contrast (DSC) perfusion was performed in 1225 patients. Images were visually assessed by two readers and five ROIs were evaluated for each patient. Pearson correlation, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied for statistical analysis.; Three patients were not further evaluated because of artefacts. Mean values of high-grade (III-IV) gliomas showed significantly lower T2' values than low-grade (II) gliomas (p < 0.001). An inverse relationship was observed between rCBV and sqr (T2') (r = -0.463, p < 0.001). No correlation was observed between T2' and rCBV for grade II tumours (r = 0.038; p = 0.875).; High-grade tumours revealed lower T2' values, presumably because of higher oxygen consumption in proliferating tissue. Our results indicate that T2' imaging can be used as an alternative to DSC perfusion in the detection of subtle deviations in tumour metabolism.

N2  -  To investigate if quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements can predict genetic subtypes of non-gadolinium-enhancing gliomas, comparing whole tumour against single slice analysis.
Volumetric T2-derived masks of 44 gliomas were co-registered to ADC maps with ADC mean (ADC(mean)) calculated. For the slice analysis, two observers placed regions of interest in the largest tumour cross-section. The ratio (ADC(ratio)) between ADC(mean) in the tumour and normal appearing white matter was calculated for both methods.; Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type gliomas showed the lowest ADC values throughout (p < 0.001). ADC(mean) in the IDH-mutant 1p19q intact group was significantly higher than in the IDH-mutant 1p19q co-deleted group (p < 0.01). A volumetric ADC(mean) threshold of 1201 x 10(-6) mm(2)s identified IDH wild-type with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 86%; a volumetric ADC(ratio) cut-off value of 1.65 provided a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 92% (area under the curve (AUC) 0.9-0.94). A slice ADC(ratio) threshold for observer 1 (observer 2) of 1.76 (1.83) provided a sensitivity of 80% (86%), specificity of 91% (100%) and AUC of 0.95 (0.96). The intraclass correlation coefficient was excellent (0.98).; ADC measurements can support the distinction of glioma subtypes. Volumetric and two-dimensional measurements yielded similar results in this study.; aEuro cent Diffusion-weighted MRI aids the identification of non-gadolinium-enhancing malignant gliomas; aEuro cent ADC measurements may permit non-gadolinium-enhancing glioma molecular subtyping; aEuro cent IDH wild-type gliomas have lower ADC values than IDH-mutant tumours; aEuro cent Single cross-section and volumetric ADC measurements yielded comparable results in this study.

N2  -  Objectives To assess the use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in the evaluation of the fetal kidney and to estimate age-dependent changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of normal and pathological fetal kidneys.
Methods DW-MRI was performed on a 1.5-T machine at 23-38 gestational weeks in 51 pregnant women in whom the fetal kidneys were normal and in 10 whose fetuses had renal pathology (three with suspected nephropathy, three with renal tract dilatation, one with unilateral renal venous thrombosis, and three with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)). The ADC was measured in an approximately 1-cm(2) region of interest within the renal parenchyma.; Results ADC values in normal renal parenchyma ranged from 1.1 to 1.810(-3) mm(2)s(-1) . There was no significant age-dependent change in the ADC of normal kidneys. In cases of nephropathy, the ADC value was not always pathological but an ADC map could show abnormal findings. In cases of dilatation, the ADC value was difficult to determine when the dilatation was huge. In cases of TITS, the ADC of the donor twin was higher than that of the recipient twin and the difference seemed to be related to the severity of the syndrome.; Conclusion Evaluation of the ADC for fetal kidneys is feasible. Fetal measurement of the ADC value and ADC maps may be useful tools with which to explore the fetal kidney when used in conjunction with current methods. DW-MR images, ADC value and ADC map seem to be useful in cases of suspected nephropathy (hyperechoic kidneys), dilated kidney and vascular pathology (renal venous thrombosis, TTTS).

N2  -  Background: Paragangliomas are rare, hypervascularized benign tumors. In some cases a clear differentiation of paragangliomas and other entities is impossible.
Patients and Methods: The authors evaluated ten patients with skull base Lesions (paraganglioma n = 7, meningioma n = 1, giant cell tumor n = 1, and neurinoma n = 1) in addition to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).; Results: Mean ADC values standard deviation of the paragangliomas were 1.304 +- 0.257 x 10(-3) mm(2)s and differed from ADC values of the other jugular fossa tumors with 0.743 +- 0.108 x 10(-3) mm(2)s and measurement derived from the cerebellum with 0.802 +- 0.075 x 10(-3) mm(2)s.; Conclusion: Due to the difference of ADC values, the authors propose that DWI and ADC mapping could be a promising tool. in the diagnostic work-up of paragangliomas.

N2  -  Background: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a cause of stroke with obscure pa tho physiologic properties that differ from arterial stroke. Its main mechanisms of pathophysiology are the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the coexistence of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. However, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot differentiate between vasogenic and cytotoxic edema.
Objectives: To describe the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings and characterize the clinical applications of DWI in CVT.; Setting: A tertiary referral center, neurology department.; Design and Methods: From November 1998 to March 2001, 14 patients (5 men, 9 women; mean age, 43 +- 10 years) with CVT underwent DWI, conventional MRI, MR venography, or conventional cerebral angiography. Abnormal findings on DWI and conventional MRI indicated the necessity of MR venography and conventional angiography to confirm the diagnosis of CVT. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in all of the abnormal lesions with visual inspection of DWI and T2-weighted echo planar imaging.; Results: Findings on DWI were grouped according to 3 patterns: (1) Heterogeneous signal intensity (SI) (10 patients) showed mixed bright high SI and low SI and the corresponding ADC values were inversely correlated to the DWI SI. The areas of prominent low S1 on DWI were reversed with adequate treatment on follow-up MRI in 1 patient. (2) Multifocal high S1 (3 patients) was similar to that observed in acute arterial stroke. The corresponding AD C values were decreased and DWI was performed in the acute stages. (3) Intravascular clot with high S1 was found with (I patient, also in heterogenous SI group) or without (1 patient) parenchymal lesions. In I patient, DWI demonstrated T2-negative and fluid attenuated inversion recovery-negative lesions without correlative symptoms.; Conclusions: These data suggest that DWI with ADC maps can be used to discriminate between types of edema for tissue viability and to provide information about stages and diagnostic clues in CVT.

N2  -  Purpose Chemotherapy increases survival in breast cancer patients. Consequently, cerebral metastases have recently become a significant clinical problem, with an incidence of 30-40% among breast carcinoma patients. As this phenomenon cannot be studied longitudinally in humans, models which mimic brain metastasis are needed to investigate its pathogenesis. Such models may later be used in experimental therapeutic approaches.
Material and methodsresults We report a model in which 69% of the animals (913 BALBc nude mice) developed MR-detectable abnormal masses in the brain parenchyma within a 20 to 62-day time window post intra-carotid injection of 435-Br1 human cells. The masses detected in vivo were either single (7 animals) or multiple (2 animals). Longitudinal MR (MRIMRS) studies and post-mortem histological data were correlated, revealing a total incidence of experimental brain metastases of 85% in the cases studied (1113 animals). ADC maps perfectly differentiated edema andor CSF areas from metastasis. Preliminary MRS data also revealed additional features: decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) was the first MRS-based marker of metastasis growth in the brain (micrometastasis); choline-containing compounds (Cho) rose and creatine (Cr) levels decreased as these lesions evolved, with mobile lipids and lactate also becoming visible. Furthermore, MRS pattern recognition-based analysis suggested that this approach may help to discriminate different growth stages.; Conclusions This study paves the way for further in vivo studies oriented towards detection of different tumor progression states and for improving treatment efficiency.

N2  -  Purpose This prospective study evaluated the use of vascular, extracellular and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumours (VERDICT) MRI to investigate the tissue microstructure in glioma. VERDICT-derived parameters were correlated with both histological features and tumour subtype and were also used to explore the peritumoural region. Methods Fourteen consecutive treatment-naive patients (43.5 years +/- 15.1 years, six males, eight females) with suspected glioma underwent diffusion-weighted imaging including VERDICT modelling. Tumour cell radius and intracellular and combined extracellular/vascular volumes were estimated using a framework based on linearisation and convex optimisation. An experienced neuroradiologist outlined the peritumoural oedema, enhancing tumour and necrosis on T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The same regions of interest were applied to the co-registered VERDICT maps to calculate the microstructure parameters. Pathology sections were analysed with semi-automated software to measure cellularity and cell size. Results VERDICT parameters were successfully calculated in all patients. The imaging-derived results showed a larger intracellular volume fraction in high-grade glioma compared to low-grade glioma (0.13 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.02, respectively; p = 0.05) and a trend towards a smaller extracellular/vascular volume fraction (0.88 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.04, respectively; p = 0.10). The conventional apparent diffusion coefficient was higher in low-grade gliomas compared to high-grade gliomas, but this difference was not statistically significant (1.22 +/- 0.13 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs. 0.98 +/- 0.38 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively; p = 0.18). Conclusion This feasibility study demonstrated that VERDICT MRI can be used to explore the tissue microstructure of glioma using an abbreviated protocol. The VERDICT parameters of tissue structure correlated with those derived on histology. The method shows promise as a potential test for diagnostic stratification and treatment response monitoring in the future.

N2  -  Conflicting results on differentiating edema and glioma by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are possibly attributable to dissimilar spatial distribution of the lesions. Combining DTI-parameters and enhanced registration might improve prediction. Regions of edema surrounding 22 metastases were compared to tumor-infiltrated regions from WHO grade 2 (12), 3 (10) and 4 (18) gliomas. DTI data was co-registered using Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), to measure Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) for white matter only, and relative changes compared to matching reference regions (dFA and dMD). A two-factor principal component analysis (PCA) on metastasis and grade 2 glioma was performed to explore a possible differentiating combined factor. Edema demonstrated equal MD and higher FA compared to grade 2 and 3 glioma (P < 0.001), but did not differ from glioblastoma. Differences were non-significant when corrected for spatial distribution, since reference regions differed strongly (P < 0.001). The second component of the PCA (PCA-C2) did differentiate edema and low-grade tumor (sensitivity 91.7 %, specificity 86.4 %). PCA-C2 scores were plotted voxel-wise as a probability-map, discerning distinct areas of presumed edema or tumor infiltration. Correction of spatial dependency appears essential when differentiating glioma from edema. A tumor-infiltration probability-map is presented, based on supplementary information of multiple DTI parameters and spatial normalization.

N2  -  Objective: Differential diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) or mimics can be challenging, especially in patients with atypical presentations and negative serostatus for aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-Ab). This brief research report describes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings focusing on quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis as a potential tool to differentiate NMOSD from MS.
Methods: Longitudinal MRI data obtained during routine clinical examinations were retrospectively analyzed in a patient with histologically determined cerebral NMOSD, a patient with an acute tumefactive MS lesion, and a patient with ischemic stroke. Histogram analyses of ADC maps were evaluated.; Results: A patient diagnosed with MS experienced a severe rebound after fingolimod withdrawal and a single daclizumab injection. Cerebral NMOSD manifestation was con firmed by brain biopsy. However, the patient did not fulfill consensus criteria for NMOSD and was AQP4-Ab negative. Comparison of ADC histogram analyses of this patient with those from a patient with MS and one with ischemic stroke revealed differential ADC characteristics: namely a more pronounced and prolonged ADC leftward shift in inflammatory than in ischemic pathology, even more accentuated in NMOSD versus MS.; Conclusion: ADC map histograms and ADC threshold values for different conditions may be useful for differentiation of large inflammatory brain lesions and further studies are merited.

N2  -  Background. The functional diffusion map (fDM) has been suggested as a tool for early detection of tumor treatment efficacy. We aim to study 3 factors that could act as potential confounders in the fDM: areas of necrosis, tumor grade, and change in tumor size.
Methods. Thirty-four pediatric patients with brain tumors were enrolled in a retrospective study, approved by the local ethics committee, to examine the fDM. Tumors were selected to encompass a range of types and grades. A qualitative analysis was carried out to compare how fDM findings may be affected by each of the 3 confounders by comparing fDM findings to clinical image reports.; Results. Results show that the fDM in areas of necrosis do not discriminate between treatment response and tumor progression. Furthermore, tumor grade alters the behavior of the fDM: a decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a sign of tumor progression in high-grade tumors and treatment response in low-grade tumors. Our results also suggest using only tumor area overlap between the 2 time points analyzed for the fDM in tumors of varying size.; Conclusions. Interpretation of fDM results needs to take into account the underlying biology of both tumor and healthy tissue. Careful interpretation of the results is required with due consideration to areas of necrosis, tumor grade, and change in tumor size.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is understood to have a role in outcome evaluation and risk assessment and is commonly involved with infiltrative tumors. A detailed understanding of the exact location and nature of associated white matter tracts could significantly improve postoperative morbidity related to declining capacity. Through diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking validated by gross anatomical dissection as ground truth, the authors have characterized these connections based on relationships to other well-known structures.
METHODS Diffusion imaging from the Human Connectome Project for 10 healthy adult controls was used for tractography analysis. The OFC was evaluated as a whole based on connectivity with other regions. All OFC tracts were mapped in both hemispheres, and a lateralization index was calculated with resultant tract volumes. Ten postmortem dissections were then performed using a modified Klingler technique to demonstrate the location of major tracts.; RESULTS The authors identified 3 major connections of the OFC: a bundle to the thalamus and anterior cingulate gyrus, passing inferior to the caudate and medial to the vertical fibers of the thalamic projections; a bundle to the brainstem, traveling lateral to the caudate and medial to the internal capsule; and radiations to the parietal and occipital lobes traveling with the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus.; CONCLUSIONS The OFC is an important center for processing visual, spatial, and emotional information. Subtle differences in executive functioning following surgery for frontal lobe tumors may be better understood in the context of the fiber-bundle anatomy highlighted by this study.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance (MR)-derived radiomic features have shown substantial predictive utility in modeling different prognostic factors of glioblastoma and other brain cancers. However, the biological relationship underpinning these predictive models has been largely unstudied, and the generalizability of these models had been called into question. Here, we examine the localized relationship between MR-derived radiomic features and histology-derived "histomic" features using a data set of 16 patients with brain cancer. Tile-based radiomic features were collected on T1, post-contrast T1, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images acquired before patient death, with analogous histomic features collected for autopsy samples coregistered to the magnetic resonance imaging. Features were collected for each original image, as well as a 3D wavelet decomposition of each image, resulting in 837 features per MR and histology image. Correlative analyses were used to assess the degree of association between radiomic-histomic pairs for each magnetic resonance imaging. The influence of several confounds was also assessed using linear mixed-effect models for the normalized radiomic-histomic distance, testing for main effects of different acquisition field strengths. Results as a whole were largely heterogeneous, but several features showed substantial associations with their histomic analogs, particularly those derived from the FLAIR and postcontrast T1W images. These features with the strongest association typically presented as stable across field strengths as well. These data suggest that a subset of radiomic features can consistently capture texture information on underlying tissue histology.

The dataset also contains behavioral and emotional scores obtained with standardized questionnaires. To simulate personalized computational models of the brain, we also provide structural connectivity matrices, necessary to perform whole-brain modelling with tools such as The Virtual Brain. In addition, we provide blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging time series averaged across regions of interest for comparison with simulation results. An average resting state hemodynamic response function for each region of interest, as well as shape maps for each voxel, are also contributed.

N2  -  Background: Pre-operative glial brain tumor grading could determine the management. Perfusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWMRI) is a promising modality for assessment and management of brain lesions.
Objectives: In this study, we assessed the diagnostic efficacy of this method in the grading of supratentorial gliomas using 3 Tesla MRI.; Patients and Methods: Using a 3 Tesla MRI unit, 35 (20 male, and 15 female) patients with glioma were examined one month before surgery. Imaging protocol was: 615 slices, field of view (FOV) 22 x 22 cm(2) T1W spin echo: repetition time (TR) 500-echo time (TE) 30 and (FOV) 22 x 22 cm(2) T2W Turbo spin echo: TR 5000-TE 90. Then 15 cc gadolinium was injected at the rate of 3ccs and imaging was repeated with: TR 2360 TE: 45, flip angle 90, band width 1346 echo planar imaging (EPI)128 measurement 50. Mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured at enhancing and edematous regions compared to contralateral white matter. Then, an appropriate biopsy was performed from different sites of the tumor during surgical excision. Standard hispathological examination that was assessed in a double-blinded manner, was considered as gold standard.; Results: Patients' tumor distribution was grade IV in 14 (40%), grade II in 14 (40%), grade III in six (17.1%) and grade I in one (2.9%). Relative CBF (rCBF), and rCBV was significantly more in high-grade glioma (HGG) versus low-grade glioma (LGG) (P < 0.001 and P < 0.009, respectively) and rCBF difference was more than rCBV but it was not significant. MTT was statistically the same in both groups and there was no difference between them. A value of rCBV greater than 2 showed a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 67% and rCBF greater than 1.4 showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 74% in discrimination of high grade gliomas versus low grade gliomas.; Conclusion: PWMRI is more accurate than conventional MRI for noninvasive discrimination of low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) that could be helpful for neurosurgeons in decision making dealing with the most common tumor of the brain.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging of the self-diffusion of water has become increasingly popular for the early detection of cerebral infarction in adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate MR line scan diffusion imaging (LSDI) of the brain in children.
METHODS: LSDI was performed in four volunteers and 12 patients by using an effective TRTE of 273689.4 and a maximum b value of 450 to 600 smm(2) applied in the x, y, and z directions. In the volunteers, single-shot echo planar imaging of diffusion (EPID) was also performed. The patients (10 boys and two girls) ranged in age from 2 days to 16 years (average age, 6.6 years). Diagnoses included acute cerebral infarction, seizure disorder, posttraumatic confusion syndrome, complicated migraine, residual astrocytoma, encephalitis, hypoxia without cerebral infarction, cerebral contusion, and conversion disorder. In all patients, routine spin-echo images were also acquired. Trace images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were produced for each location scanned with LSDI.; RESULTS: In the volunteers, LSDI showed less chemical-shift and magnetic-susceptibility artifact and less geometric distortion than did EPID, LSDI was of diagnostic quality in all studies. Diffusion abnormalities were present in five patients. Restricted diffusion was present in the lesions of the three patients with acute cerebral infarction. Mildly increased diffusion was present in the lesions of encephalitis and residual cerebellar astrocytoma. No diffusion abnormalities were seen in the remaining seven children.; CONCLUSION: LSDI is feasible in children, provides high-quality diffusion images with less chemical-shift and magnetic-susceptibility artifact and less geometric distortion than does EPID, and complements the routine MR examination.

N2  -  Based on the assumption that apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) define high-risk clinical target volume (aCTV(HR)) in high-grade glioma in a cellularity-dependent manner, the dosimetric effects of aCTV(HR)-targeted dose optimization were evaluated in two intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and ADC maps were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to determine aCTV(HR) in a high-grade glioma with high cellularity. After confirming tumor malignancy using the average and minimum ADCs and ADC ratios, the aCTV(HR) with double- or triple-restricted water diffusion was defined on computed tomography images through image registration. Doses to the aCTV(HR) and CTV defined on T1-weighted MR images were optimized using a simultaneous integrated boost technique. The dosimetric benefits for CTVs and organs at risk (OARs) were compared using dose volume histograms and various biophysical indices in an ADC map-based IMRT (IMRTADC) plan and a conventional IMRT (IMRTconv) plan. The IMRTADC plan improved dose conformity up to 15 times, compared to the IMRTconv plan. It reduced the equivalent uniform doses in the visual system and brain stem by more than 10% and 16%, respectively. The ADC-based target differentiation and dose optimization may facilitate conformal dose distribution to the aCTV(HR) and OAR sparing in an IMRT plan.

N2  -  Alteration of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology underlying paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). We investigated macrostructural and microstructural changes in PKD patients using structural and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses. Twenty-five patients with idiopathic PKD and 25 control subjects were prospectively studied on a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. Cortical thickness analysis was used to evaluate cortical gray matter (GM) changes, and automated volumetry and shape analysis were used to assess volume changes and shape deformation of the subcortical GM structures, respectively. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to evaluate white matter integrity changes in a whole-brain manner, and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of diffusion tensor metrics was performed in subcortical GM structures. Compared to controls, PKD patients exhibited a reduction in volume of bilateral thalami and regional shape deformation mainly localized to the anterior and medial aspects of bilateral thalami. TBSS revealed an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) of bilateral thalami and right anterior thalamic radiation in patients relative to controls. ROI analysis also showed an increase in FA of bilateral thalami in patients compared to controls. We have shown evidence for thalamic abnormalities of volume reduction, regional shape deformation, and increased FA in patients with PKD. Our novel findings of concomitant macrostructural and microstructural abnormalities in the thalamus lend further support to previous observations indicating causal relationship between a preferential lesion in the thalamus and development of PKD, thus providing neuroanatomical basis for the involvement of thalamus within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway in PKD.

N2  -  PX-478 is a new agent known to inhibit the hypoxia-responsive transcription factor, HIF-1 alpha, in experimental tumors. The current study was undertaken in preparation for clinical trials to determine which noninvasive imaging endpoint(s) is sensitive to this drug's actions. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to monitor acute effects on tumor hemodynamics and cellularity, respectively. Mice bearing human xenografts were treated either with PX-478 or vehicle, and imaged over time. DW imaging was performed at three b values to generate apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw) maps. For DCE-MRI, a macromolecular contrast reagent, BSA-Gd-DTPA, was used to determine vascular permeability and vascular volume fractions. PX-478 induced a dramatic reduction in tumor blood vessel permeability within 2 hours after treatment, which returned to baseline by 48 hours. The anti-VEGF antibody, Avastin, reduced both the permeability and vascular volume. PX-478 had no effect on the perfusion behavior of a drug-resistant tumor system, A-549. Tumor cellularity, estimated from ADCw, was significantly decreased 24 and 36 hours after treatment. This is the earliest significant response of ADC to therapy yet reported. Based on these preclinical findings, both of these imaging endpoints will be included in the clinical trial of PX-478.

N2  -  Quantification of the acute increases in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability that occur subsequent to experimental ischemic injury has been limited to single time-point, invasive methodologies. Although permeability can be qualitatively assessed to visualise regional changes during sequential studies on the same animal using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), quantitative information on the magnitude of change is required to compare barrier function during sequential studies on the same animal or between different animals. Recently, improvements in MRI tracer kinetic models and in MR hardware design mean that an estimate of permeability in vivo can now be obtained with acceptable accuracy and precision, We report here the use of such methods to study acute changes following spontaneous reperfusion in an animal model of ischemia. We have obtained estimates of BBB permeability following spontaneous reperfusion, subsequent to forebrain ischemia by unilateral carotid injection of starch microspheres in the rat. T2*-weighted and diffusion-trace imaging were used to monitor the initial reduction in CBF and the time-course of ischemia, respectively. Following reperfusion, an intraveneous bolus of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Gd-DTPA) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was given during a continuous acquisition of T1 maps with a 48s temporal resolution. Permeability maps were constructed using a 4-compartment model; K-trans, the permeability-surface area product of the capillary walls was estimated to be 9.2 +/- 0.6 x 10(-4) min(-1) in the cortex. Visualisation of the regional extent of HRP extravasation on histological sections following termination of the experiment demonstrated very little correspondence to the region of Gd-DTPA leakage. Quantitative MRI assessment of BBB permeability following ischemia-reperfusion is consistent with published values obtained by invasive methods. Differences between Gd-DTPA-enhancement and HRP may reflect differences in the molecular size of the tracers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that detects the tiny random movements of water molecules (diffusion) in tissues. This technique allows a map of the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to be calculated. Shot-try after the onset of an ischemic stroke, the ADC of brain tissue is significantly reduced because of cytotoxic edema. Over several days, the rapid initial drop in ADC is followed by a return to "pseudonormal" values at approximately 1 week. Subsequently, elevated ADC values are seen at chronic time points. DWI is remarkably sensitive in detecting and localizing acute ischemic brain lesions and allows differentiation of acute regions of ischemia from chronic infarcts. Recent studies have shown a high correlation between the volume of early DWI lesions and clinical neurologic outcome. In addition, the volume of the early DWI lesion correlates well with final infarct volume as measured by T2-weighted imaging. Therefore, this technique may facilitate optimal selection of patients for new medical therapies for stroke and may provide a highly sensitive technique for evaluating the efficacy of new treatments.

N2  -  The present study aimed to detect the main regions of cerebral white matter (CWM) showing damage in the subacute phase for CO-poisoned patients with chronic neurological symptoms using voxel-based analysis (VBA) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Subjects comprised 22 adult CO-poisoned patients and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers as controls. Patients were classified into patients with transient acute symptoms only (group A) and patients with chronic neurological symptoms (group S). In all patients, DTI covering the whole brain was performed with a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging system at 2 weeks after CO exposure. As procedures for VBA, all fractional anisotropy (FA) maps obtained from DTI were spatially normalized, and FA values for all voxels in the whole CWM on normalized FA maps were statistically compared among the two patient groups and controls.; Voxels with significant differences in FA were detected at various regions in comparisons between groups S and A and between group S and controls. In these comparisons, more voxels were detected in deep CWM, including the centrum semiovale, than in other regions. A few voxels were detected between group A and controls. Absolute FA values in the centrum semiovale were significantly lower in group S than in group A or controls.; VBA demonstrated that CO-poisoned patients with chronic neurological symptoms had already suffered damage to various CWM regions in the subacute phase. In these regions, the centrum semiovale was suggested to be the main region damaged in the subacute phase after CO inhalation.

N2  -  Employing magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, three-dimensional white-matter imaging and conventional magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate the tumor parenchyma, peritumoral edema and compression on surrounding brain tissue. A color-coded tensor map and three-dimensional tracer diagram were applied to clearly display the optic-radiation location, course and damage. Results showed that the altered anisotropy values of meningioma patients corresponded with optic-radiation shape, size and position on both sides. Experimental findings indicate that the magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging technique is a means of tracing and clearly visualizing the optic radiation.

N2  -  Background: Radiologic response of brain tumors is traditionally assessed according to the Macdonald criteria 10 weeks from the start of therapy. Because glioblastoma (GB) responds in days rather than weeks after boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) that is a form of tumor-selective particle radiation, it is inconvenient to use the Macdonald criteria to assess the therapeutic efficacy of BNCT by gadolinium-magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI). Our study assessed the utility of functional diffusion map (fDM) for evaluating response patterns in GB treated by BNCT.
Methods: The fDM is an image assessment using time-dependent changes of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in tumors on a voxel-by-voxel approach. Other than time-dependent changes of ADC, fDM can automatically assess minimummaximum ADC, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), and the volume of enhanced lesions on Gd-MRI over time. We assessed 17 GB patients treated by BNCT using fDM. Additionally, in order to verify our results, we performed a histopathological examination using F98 rat glioma models.; Results: Only the volume of tumor with decreased ADC by fDM at 2 days after BNCT was a good predictor for GB patients treated by BNCT (P value = 0.022 by log-rank test and 0.033 by wilcoxon test). In a histopathological examination, brain sections of F98 rat glioma models treated by BNCT showed cell swelling of both the nuclei and the cytoplasm compared with untreated rat glioma models.; Conclusions: The fDM could identify response patterns in BNCT-treated GB earlier than a standard radiographic assessment. Early detection of treatment failure can allow a change or supplementation before tumor progression and might lead to an improvement of GB patients' prognosis.

N2  -  Purpose: To extend the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) model to restricted diffusion and to simultaneously quantify the perfusion and restricted diffusion parameters in neck nodal metastases. Materials and Methods: The non-Gaussian (NG)-IVIM model was developed and tested on diffusion-weighted MRI data collected on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner from eight patients with head and neck cancer. Voxel-wise parameter quantification was performed by using a noise-rectified least-square fitting method. The NG-IVIM, IVIM, Kurtosis, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) models were used for comparison. For each voxel, within the metastatic node, the optimal model was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The voxel percentage preferred by each model was calculated and the optimal model map was generated. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision dependency of the new model. Results: For the eight neck nodes, the range of voxel percentage preferred by the NG-IVIM model was 2.379.3%. The optimal modal maps showed heterogeneities within the tumors. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the accuracy and precision of the NG-IVIM model improved by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and b value. Conclusion: The NG-IVIM model characterizes perfusion and restricted diffusion simultaneously in neck nodal metastases. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;36:10881096. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

After delineation, the imaging parameters were extracted using only the data from within the ROI including mean diffusion kurtosis (MK), return-to-origin probability (RTOP), Q-space inverse variance (QIV) and non-Gaussian index (NG), and the differences in each parameter in the classification of glioma were compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these parameters. Results MK, NG, RTOP and QIV were significantly different amongst the different grades of glioma. MK, NG and RTOP had excellent diagnostic value in differentiating high-grade from low-grade glioma, with largest areas under the curve (AUCs; 0.929, 0.933 and 0.819, respectively; P < 0.01). MK and NG had the largest AUCs (0.912 and 0.904) when differentiating grade II tumours from III tumours (P < 0.01) and large AUCs (0.791 and 0.786) when differentiating grade III from grade IV tumours. Correlation analysis of tumour proliferation activity showed that MK, NG and QIV were strongly correlated with the Ki-67 LI (P < 0.001). Conclusion MK, RTOP and NG can effectively represent the microstructure of these altered tumours. Multimodal diffusion-weighted imaging is valuable for the preoperative evaluation of glioma grade and tumour proliferative activity.

N2  -  Group-level voxelwise statistical analyses of lesion-deficit relationships have been used to implicate brain structures critical for specific aspects of human cognition and behavior. Current approaches fail to account for the role of fiber tract disruptions in causing deficit, and confound cortical damage with damage to fibers of passage. Here, we develop a framework, Generalized Lesion-Symptom Mapping (GLSM), to integrate fiber tract information from DTI-based tractographic atlases in tractwise and voxelwise lesion-deficit analyses. First, we used the geniculo-calcarine system as a validation testbed. Using logistic regressions we predicted right homonymous visual field deficits in 149 subjects with focal brain damage based on lesion location, with and without incorporating fiber tract information. A probabilistic fiber tract atlas [Wakana S, Jiang H, Nagae-Poetscher LM, Van ZijI PC, Mori S. Fiber tract-based atlas of human white matter anatomy. Radiology 2004;230:77-87] coregistered to our reference brain was used to estimate disconnection to the optic radiations and adjacent fiber tracts. When tract information was not incorporated, lesions in multiple sectors of the temporal lobe were associated with visual field defects. When the optic radiations were incorporated, this artifactual association was eliminated and the calcarine cortex was correctly isolated. Among the incorporated tracts, only the optic radiations significantly predicted visual field defects. Second, we applied the approach to impairments of higher visuoperceptual functions in 111 subjects who were administered the Hooper Visual Organization Test. We included all six association fiber tracts available in the atlas, plus the optic radiations. Tract inclusion narrowed the cortical sectors associated with impaired performance in a manner consistent with recent fMRI findings. The left cingulum and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, significantly predicted impairments. The results demonstrate the viability, validity and value of incorporating fiber tract information in lesion-deficit analyses. The enhanced analysis framework opens a new avenue for studying neural systems, with the potential to facilitate identification of both cortical sectors and fiber tracts critical for cognitive functioning.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs) have been demonstrated with diffusion-weighted MRT. (DWI) in experimental stroke and are regarded as an important mechanism of ischemic injury. We tested the hypothesis that PIDs are of relevance for the early enlargement of human brain infarcts.
Methods-Ten stroke patients were investigated by repetitive imaging of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the acute phase (7 patients) or subacute phase (3 patients) of developing cortical infarction. In each patient, 20 ADC maps were obtained from serially measured echo-planar DWI (interval of 45 seconds). Data analysis focused on the potential spatial and temporal ADC changes, including structured qualitative analysis, calculation of subtraction images, serial analysis of regions of interest positioned in the infarct core and border, and calculation of hemispheric lesion areas, depending on various ADC thresholds ranging between 0 and 800 mum(2)s.; Results-Data analysis was unable to disclose any time-dependent changes in ADC that would resemble PID. In ischemic regions, the ADC reduction significantly progressed from the infarct border (555+-96 mum(2)s) to the infarct core (431+-101 mum(2)s, P<0.01).; Conclusions-By using an MRI protocol with high temporal resolution and elaborated postprocessing, we were unable to demonstrate a pattern of diffusion changes that would be indicative of PID in human stroke. Experimental infarction and human stroke may differ in the detectability of PID.

N2  -  Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis in children, but 0.4% of patients with KD exhibit central nervous system involvement. Acute encephalitis and encephalopathy accompanied with KD have been reported to be mostly self-limiting complications.
Case Presentation: A 2-year-old girl developed recurrent vomiting, a cluster of generalized seizures, and decreased consciousness on day 12 after the onset of KD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted images on day 13 showed high signal intensities in bilaterally symmetrical and subcortical white matter and thalamus, and linear radial hyperintensities parallel to the cerebral vessels of the periventricular white matter. Diffuse white matter hyperintensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient map suggested vasogenic edema. Subsequently, lethal cerebral edema rapidly progressed in 8 hrs after the MRI examination.; Conclusion: To our knowledge, acute fulminant cerebral edema in patients with KD has not been previously reported. We should be aware of the possibility of severe encephalitis related to KD. Furthermore, diffuse white matter vasogenic edema with perivascular abnormalities on MRI may be an alerm, potentially leading to fatal cerebral edema.

T2  -  ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease that involves both white and gray matter. Although gray matter damage is a major contributor to disability in MS patients, conventional clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fails to accurately detect gray matter pathology and establish a clear correlation with clinical symptoms. Using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), we previously reported global brain softening in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it needs to be established if changes of the spatiotemporal patterns of brain tissue mechanics constitute a marker of neuroinflammation. Here, we use advanced multifrequency MRE with tomoelastography postprocessing to investigate longitudinal and regional inflammation-induced tissue changes in EAE and in a small group of MS patients. Surprisingly, we found reversible softening in synchrony with the EAE disease course predominantly in the cortex of the mouse brain. This cortical softening was associated neither with a shift of tissue water compartments as quantified by T2-mapping and diffusion-weighted MRI, nor with leukocyte infiltration as seen by histopathology. Instead, cortical softening correlated with transient structural remodeling of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which involved abnormal chondroitin sulfate expression and microgliosis. These mechanisms also appear to be critical in humans with MS, where tomoelastography for the first time demonstrated marked cortical softening. Taken together, our study shows that neuroinflammation (i) critically affects the integrity of PNNs in cortical brain tissue, in a reversible process that correlates with disease disability in EAE, (ii) reduces the mechanical integrity of brain tissue rather than leading to water accumulation, and (iii) shows similar spatial patterns in humans and mice. These results raise the prospect of leveraging MRE and quantitative MRI for MS staging and monitoring treatment in affected patients.

N2  -  Rationale and objectives: Classifying brain tumors is challenging, but recently developed imaging techniques offer the opportunity for neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to diagnose, differentiate, and manage different types of brain tumors. Such advances will be reflected in improvements in patients' life expectancy and quality of life. Among the newest techniques, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which tracks the rate of microscopic water diffusion within tissues, has become a focus of investigation. Recently, ADC has been used as a preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter that facilitates tumor diagnosis and grading. Here, we aimed to determine the ADC cutoff values for pediatric brain tumors (PBTs) categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors.
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 80 cases, and assessed them based on their MRI-derived ADC. These results were compared with those of WHO classification-based histopathology.; Results: Whole-lesion ADC values ranged 0.225-1.240 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for ependymal tumors, 0.107-1.571 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for embryonal tumors, 0.1065-2.37801 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, 0.5220-0.7840 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for other astrocytic tumors, and 0.1530-0.8160 x 10(-3) mm(2)s for meningiomas. These findings revealed the usefulness of ADC in the differential diagnosis of PBT, as it was able to discriminate between five types of PBTs.; Conclusion: The application of an ADC diagnostic criterion would reduce the need for spectroscopic analysis. However, further research is needed to implement ADC in the differential diagnosis of PBT.

N2  -  Combined functional, perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a temporal resolution of 30 mins was performed on permanent and transient focal ischemic brain injury in rats during the acute phase. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF), and functional MRI (fMRI) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD), CBF, and CMRO2 responses associated with CO2 challenge and forepaw stimulation were measured. An automated cluster analysis of ADC and CBF data was used to track the spatial and temporal progression of different tissue types (e.g., normal, 'at risk,' and ischemic core) on a pixel-by-pixel basis. With permanent ischemia (n=11), forepaw stimulation fMRI response in the primary somatosensory cortices was lost, although vascular coupling (CO2 response) was intact in some animals. Control experiments in which the right common carotid artery was ligated without causing a stroke (n=8) showed that the delayed transit time had negligible effect on the fMRI responses in the primary somatosensory cortices. With temporary (15-mins, n=8) ischemia, transient CBF and/or ADC declines were observed after reperfusion. However, no T-2 or TTC lesions were observed at 24h except in two animals, which showed very small subcortical lesions. Vascular coupling and forepaw fMRI response also remained intact. Finally, comparison of the relative and absolute fMRI signal changes suggest caution when interpreting percent changes in disease states in which the baseline signals are physiologically altered; quantitative CBF fMRI are more appropriate measures. This approach provides valuable information regarding ischemic tissue viability, vascular coupling, and functional integrity associated with ischemic injury and could have potential clinical applications.

N2  -  Background: Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show that a fraction of the multiple sclerosis (MS) T2-lesions contain T1-hypointense components that may persist to represent severe, irreversible tissue damage. It is not known why certain lesions convert to persistent T1-hypointense lesions. Objective: We hypothesized that the T1-hypointense lesions disproportionately distribute in the more hypoperfused areas of the brain. Here we investigated the association between hypoperfusion and T1-hypointense lesion distributions. Methods: MRI and cerebral blood flow (CBF) data were acquired on 45 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 20 healthy controls. CBF maps were generated using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling technique. The lesion probability distribution maps were superimposed on the CBF maps. Results: Two distinct CBF clusters were observed in the white matter (WM) both in healthy controls and MS patients. An overall reduction in CBF was observed in MS patients compared to healthy controls. The majority of the T1-hypointense lesions were concentrated almost exclusively in the WM regions with lower CBF. The T2-hyperintense lesions were more generally distributed in both higher and lower perfused WM. Conclusion: This study suggests an association between hypoperfusion and T1-hypointense lesions.

N2  -  Progress has recently been made in implementing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that can be used to obtain images in a fraction of a second rather than in minutes.  Echo-planar imaging (EPI) uses only one nuclear spin excitation per image and lends itself to a variety of critical medical and scientific applications.  Among these are evaluation of cardiac function in real time, mapping of water diffusion and temperature in tissue, mapping of organ blood pool and perfusion, functional imaging of the central nervous system, depiction of blood and cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics, and movie imaging of the mobile fetus in utero.  Through shortened patient examination times, higher  patient throughput, and lower cost per MRI examination, EPI may become a powerful tool for early diagnosis of some common and potentially treatable diseases such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cancer.

N2  -  Cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, and gliomas are common intraaxial brain lesions in dogs. An accurate differentiation of these two lesions is necessary for prognosis and treatment decisions. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of 21 dogs with a presumed cerebrovascular accident and 17 with a glioma were compared. MR imaging findings were reviewed retrospectively by three observers unaware of the final diagnosis. Statistically significant differences between the appearance of gliomas and cerebrovascular accidents were identified based on lesion location, size, mass effect, perilesional edema, and appearance of the apparent diffusion coefficient map. Gliomas were predominantly located in the cerebrum (76%) compared with presumed cerebrovascular accidents that were located mainly in the cerebellum, thalamus, caudate nucleus, midbrain, and brainstem (76%). Gliomas were significantly larger compared with presumed cerebrovascular accidents and more commonly associated with mass effect and perilesional edema. Wedge-shaped lesions were seen only in 19% of presumed cerebrovascular accidents. Between the three observers, 10-47% of the presumed cerebrovascular accidents were misdiagnosed as gliomas, and 0-12% of the gliomas were misdiagnosed as cerebrovascular accidents. Diffusion weighted imaging increased the accuracy of the diagnosis for both lesions. Agreement between observers was moderate (kappa=0.48, P < 0.01).

N2  -  The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) tumors constitutes a significant part of a pediatric neurosurgeon's workload. The classification of such neoplasms spans many entities. These include low- and high-grade lesions, with both occurring in the population of patients under 18 years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging serves as the imaging method of choice for neoplastic lesions of the brain. Through its different modalities, such as T1, T2, T1 C+, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), etc., it allows the medical team to plan the therapeutic process accordingly while also possibly suggesting the specific tumor subtype prior to obtaining a definitive histological diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective study spanning 32 children treated surgically for brain tumors between July 2021 and January 2023 who had a precise histological diagnosis determined by using the 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. We divided them into two groups (high-grade and low-grade tumors, i.e., WHO grades 1 and 2, and grades 3 and 4, respectively) and analyzed their demographic data and preoperative MRI results. This was done using the following criteria: sub or supratentorial location of the tumor; lesion is circumscribed or infiltrating; solid, cystic, or mixed solid and cystic character of the tumor; number of compartments in cystic lesions; signal intensity (hypo-, iso-, hyperintensity sequences: T1, T2, T1 C+); presence of restricted diffusion; the largest diameter of the solid component and/or the largest diameter of the largest cyst in the transverse section. Then, we examined the results to find any correlation between the lesions' morphologies and their final assigned degree of malignancy. We found that the only radiological criteria correlating with the final WHO grade of the tumor were an infiltrative pattern of growth (25% of low-grade lesions, 75% of high-grade; p = 0.006) and the presence of a cystic component in the tumor (in 68.75% of low-grade tumors and 43.75% of high-grade tumors; p = 0.041). The only other feature close to attaining statistical significance was diffusion restriction (33.3% of low-grade tumors, 66.7% high-grade; p = 0.055). Older children tended to present with tumors of lower degrees of malignancy, and there was a predominance of female patients (21 female, 11 male).

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: In gliomas located in proximity to eloquent areas, near total resection and subsequent radiotherapy is often preferred to avoid postoperative neurologic complications. Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography provide new insights into surgeries of insular gliomas. In this study we report our experience of surgical management of insular gliomas and the role of fMRI and DTI tractography in planning the resection.
METHODS: We retrospectively compared the clinical and outcome variables of 61 patients who underwent surgical resection of insular gliomas. The study population was divided into 2 groups according to the use of fMRI and DTI tractography in planning the resection.; RESULTS: The average age of the study population was 44.1 +- 12.6 years with 21 (34.4%) of the patients women. Nearly two thirds of them (40, or 65.6%) had World Health Organization grade II tumors, and 16 patients (26.2%) had grade IV tumors. The most common tumor was glioblastoma, observed in 16 patients (26.2%). In 10 (16.4%) patients, fMRI and DTI tractography were used. The overall mortality in the study population was 15 (24.6%). None of the patients where fMRI and DTI were used for planning the surgery died (29.4% vs. 0.0%; P = 0.05), and all of them had normal functioning (70.5% vs. 100.0%; P = 0.05) at 3 months' follow-up.; CONCLUSION: Surgical resection of insular gliomas remains a challenge to the neurosurgeon and demands good knowledge of anatomic landmarks. Use of fMRI and DTI tractography may help achieve a good outcome.

N2  -  Objectives Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may enhance the radiographic diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors. This study reviews the DWI properties of pediatric brain tumors at our institution and examines their relationship to tumor grade and type.
Materials and methods The preoperative DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) characteristics of brain tumors in 41 children were compared with histologic diagnosis. Signal characteristics on DWI and ADC maps correlated well with tumor grade. High-grade lesions were hyperintense on DWI and hypointense on ADC maps. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 70, 100, 100, and 91%, respectively. Signal characteristics did not differ among different tumors of the same grade. All primitive neuroectodermal tumors showed diffusion restriction whereas none of the ependymomas did.; Conclusions The signal characteristics on DWI and ADC maps appeared to be strongly correlated to grade in pediatric brain tumors and they may assist with preoperative diagnostic predictions.

N2  -  Background: A large proportion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have coexisting subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD), a condition referred to as mixed dementia (MixD). Brain imaging features of MixD presumably include those of cerebrovascular disease and AD pathology, but are difficult to characterize due to their heterogeneity. Objective: To perform an exploratory analysis of conventional and non-conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in MixD and to compare them to those observed in AD and SVaD. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, region-of-interest-based analysis of 1) hyperintense white-matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) on T2-FLAIR and hypointense WMSA on T1-weighted MRI; 2) diffusion tensor imaging; 3) quantitative susceptibility mapping; and 4) effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in N = 17 participants (AD:5, SVaD:5, MixD:7). General linear model was used to explore group differences in these brain imaging measures. Results: Model findings suggested imaging characteristics specific to our MixD group, including 1) higher burden of WMSAs on T1-weighted MRI (versus both AD and SVaD); 2) frontal lobar preponderance of WMSAs on both T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted MRI; 3) higher fractional anisotropy values within normal-appear white-matter tissues (versus SVaD, but not AD); and 4) lower R2* values within the T2-FLAIR WMSA areas (versus both AD and SVaD). Conclusion: These findings suggest a preliminary picture of the location and type of brain imaging characteristics associated with MixD. Future imaging studies may employ region-specific hypotheses to distinguish MixD more rigorously from AD or SVaD.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Thrombolytic treatment of stroke carries the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Therefore, the potential of MRI for prediction of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-induced bleeding is explored to identify patients in whom rtPA treatment may provoke such complications.
Methods-Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (n=9) were submitted to middle cerebral artery (MCA) clot embolism, followed 3 hours later by intra-arterial infusion of 10 mgkg rtPA. Untreated SHR (n=9) were infused with saline. MRI imaging was performed before treatment and included apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, and per-fusion mapping and contrast enhancement with gadolinium-DTPA. The distribution of intracerebral hemorrhages was studied 3 days later by histological staining.; Results-Clot embolism led to the rapid decline of ADC in the territory of the occluded artery. Tissue lesion volume derived from ADC imaging increased by 155 +- 69% in the untreated animals and by 168 +- 87% in the treated animals (P=NS), determined on the histological sections after 3 days. This same lesion growth in both groups indicated absence of therapeutic effect after 3-hour treatment delay. Hemorrhagic transformations were significantly more frequent in treated SHR (P<0.05). In untreated rats, hemorrhages were found in the border zone of the ischemic territory in treated animals, hemorrhagic transformations occurred in the ischemic core region. rtPA-induced hemorrhages were predicted by a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier in 3 of 4 animals before treatment by Gd-DTPA contrast enhancement but not by ADC, T2, or per-fusion imaging. The region of contrast enhancement colocalized with subsequent bleeding in these animals.; Conclusions-The disturbance of blood-brain barrier but not of other MR parameters allows risk assessment for hemorrhagic transformation induced by subsequent thrombolytic treatment.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate the effect of ADC heterogeneity on region of interest (ROI) measurement of isotropic and anisotropic water diffusion in acute (< 12 h) cerebral infarctions. Methods and materials: Full diffusion tensor images were retrospectively analyzed in 32 patients with acute cerebral infarction. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in ischemic lesions and in the corresponding contralateral, normal appearing brain by using four ROIs for each patient. The 2 x 2 pixel square Rolls were placed in the center, the lateral rim and the medial rim of the infarction. In addition, the whole volume of the infarction was measured using a free hand method. Each ROI value obtained from the ischemic lesion was normalized using contralateral normal ROI values. Results: The localization of the Rots in relation to the ischemic lesion significantly affected ADC measurement (P < 0.01, using Friedman test), but not FA measurement (P = 0.25). Significant differences were found between ADC values of the center of the infarction versus whole volume (P < 0.01), and medial rim versus whole volume of infarction (P < 0.001) with variation of relative ADC values up to 11%. The differences of absolute ADC for these groups were 22 and 23%, respectively. The lowest ADC was found in the center, followed by medial rim, lateral rim and whole volume of infarction. Conclusion: ADC quantification may provide variable results depending on ROI method. The ADC and FA values, obtained from the center of infarction tend to be lower compared to the periphery. The researchers who try to compare studies or work on ischemic quantification should be aware of these differences and effects. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  The ongoing 1000 brains study (1000BRAINS) is an epidemiological and neuroscientific investigation of structural and functional variability in the human brain during aging. The two recruitment sources are the 10-year follow-up cohort of the German Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study, and the HNR MultiGeneration Study cohort, which comprises spouses and offspring of HNR subjects. The HNR is a longitudinal epidemiological investigation of cardiovascular risk factors, with a comprehensive collection of clinical, laboratory, socioeconomic, and environmental data from population-based subjects aged 45-75 years on inclusion. HNR subjects underwent detailed assessments in 2000, 2006, and 2011, and completed annual postal questionnaires on health status. 1000BRAINS accesses these HNR data and applies a separate protocol comprising: neuropsychological tests of attention, memory, executive functions and language; examination of motor skills; ratings of personality, life quality, mood and daily activities; analysis of laboratory and genetic data; and state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3 Tesla) of the brain. The latter includes (i) 3D-T1- and 3D-T2-weighted scans for structural analyses and myelin mapping; (ii) three diffusion imaging sequences optimized for diffusion tensor imaging, high-angular resolution diffusion imaging for detailed fiber tracking and for diffusion kurtosis imaging; (iii) resting-state and task-based functional MRI; and (iv) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and MR angiography for the detection of vascular lesions and the mapping of white matter lesions. The unique design of 1000BRAINS allows: (i) comprehensive investigation of various influences including genetics, environment and health status on variability in brain structure and function during aging; and (ii) identification of the impact of selected influencing factors on specific cognitive subsystems and their anatomical correlates.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Primary brain tumors in motor eloquent areas are associated with high-risk surgical procedures because of potentially permanent and often disabling motor deficits. Intraoperative primary motor cortex mapping and corticospinal tract (CST) monitoring are well-developed and reliable techniques. Imaging of the CST by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) is also feasible.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practical value of 3.0T intraoperative MRI (iMRI) with intraoperative DTT (iDTT) in surgery close to the CST, and to compare high-field iDTT with intraoperative neurophysiological CST mapping during glioma and metastasis resection in a routine setting.; METHODS: Twenty-five patients (13 males, 12 females, median 47 years) were enrolled prospectively from June 2010 to June 2012. Patients were included if they had a solitary supratentorial intracerebral lesion compressing or infiltrating the CST according to preoperative MRI. Subcortical CST mapping was performed by monopolar (cathodal) stimulation (500 Hz, 400 ms, 5 pulses). CST DTT was made both at preoperative and intraoperative 3.0T MRI. Subcortical motor-evoked potential threshold current and probe-CST distance were recorded at 155 points before and at 103 points after iMRI. Current-distance correlations were performed both for pre-iMRI and for post-iMRI data.; RESULTS: The correlation coefficient pre-iMRI was R = 0.470 (P < .001); post-iMRI, the correlation coefficient was R = 0.338 (P < .001). MRI radical resection was achieved in 17 patients (68%), subtotal in 5 (24%), and partial in 3 (12%). Postoperative paresis developed in 8 patients (32%); the paresis was permanent in 1 case (4%).; CONCLUSION: The linear current-distance correlation was found both in pre-iMRI and in post-iMRI data. Intraoperative image distortion appeared in 36%. Neurophysiological subcortical mapping remains superior to DTT. Combining these 2 methods in selected cases can help increase the safety of tumor resection close to the CST.

N2  -  Recovery from aphasia can be achieved through recruitment of either perilesional brain regions in the affected hemisphere or homologous language regions in the nonlesional hemisphere. For patients with large left-hemisphere lesions, recovery through the right hemisphere may be the only possible path. The right-hemisphere regions most likely to play a role in this recovery process are the superior temporal lobe (important for auditory feedback control), premotor regions/posterior inferior frontal gyrus (important for planning and sequencing of motor actions and for auditory-motor mapping), and the primary motor cortex (important for execution of vocal motor actions). These regions are connected reciprocally via a major fiber tract called the arcuate fasciculus (AF), however, this tract is not as well developed in the right hemisphere as it is in the dominant left. We tested whether an intonation-based speech therapy (i.e., melodic intonation therapy [MIT]), which is typically administered in an intense fashion with 75-80 daily therapy sessions, would lead to changes in white-matter tracts, particularly the AF Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we found a significant increase in the number of AF fibers and AF volume comparing post- with pretreatment assessments in six patients that could not be attributed to scan-to-scan variability. This suggests that intense, long-term MIT leads to remodeling of the right AF and may provide an explanation for the sustained therapy effects that were seen in these six patients.

N2  -  Monocytes are amongst the first cells recruited into the brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have shown monocyte depletion 24 hours prior to TBI reduces brain edema, decreases neutrophil infiltration and improves behavioral outcomes. Additionally, both lesion and ventricle size correlate with poor neurologic outcome after TBI. Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between monocyte infiltration, lesion size, and ventricle volume. We hypothesized that monocyte depletion would attenuate lesion size, decrease ventricle enlargement, and preserve white matter in mice after TBI. C57BL/6 mice underwent pan monocyte depletion via intravenous injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Control mice were injected with liposome-encapsulated PBS. TBI was induced via an open-head, controlled cortical impact. Mice were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury to evaluate progression of lesion and to detect morphological changes associated with injury (3D T1-weighted MRI) including regional alterations in white matter patterns (multi-direction diffusion MRI). Lesion size and ventricle volume were measured using semi-automatic segmentation and active contour methods with the software program ITK-SNAP. Data was analyzed with the statistical software program PRISM. No significant effect of monocyte depletion on lesion size was detected using MRI following TBI (p = 0.4). However, progressive ventricle enlargement following TBI was observed to be attenuated in the monocyte-depleted cohort (5.3 +/- 0.9mm(3)) as compared to the sham-depleted cohort (13.2 +/- 3.1mm(3); p = 0.02). Global white matter integrity and regional patterns were evaluated and quantified for each mouse after extracting fractional anisotropy maps from the multi-direction diffusion-MRI data using Siemens Syngo DTI analysis package. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were preserved in the monocyte-depleted cohort (123.0 +/- 4.4mm(3)) as compared to sham-depleted mice (94.9 +/- 4.6mm(3); p = 0.025) by 14 days post-TBI. All TBI mice exhibited FA values lower than those from a representative naive control group with intact white matter tracts and FA similar to 200 mm(3)). The MRI derived assessment of injury progression suggests that monocyte depletion at the time of injury may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of TBI. Furthermore, non-invasive longitudinal imaging allows for the evaluation of both TBI progression as well as therapeutic response over the course of injury.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometry is a quantitative imaging method that measures tissue relaxation properties. This review discusses the state of the art of clinical proton MR relaxometry for glial brain tumors. Current MR relaxometry technology also includes MR fingerprinting and synthetic MRI, which solve the inefficiencies and challenges of earlier techniques. Despite mixed results regarding its capability for brain tumor differential diagnosis, there is growing evidence that MR relaxometry can differentiate between gliomas and metastases and between glioma grades. Studies of the peritumoral zones have demonstrated their heterogeneity and possible directions of tumor infiltration. In addition, relaxometry offers T2* mapping that can define areas of tissue hypoxia not discriminated by perfusion assessment. Studies of tumor therapy response have demonstrated an association between survival and progression terms and dynamics of native and contrast-enhanced tumor relaxometric profiles. In conclusion, MR relaxometry is a promising technique for glial tumor diagnosis, particularly in association with neuropathological studies and other imaging techniques.

N2  -  IntroductionMultiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most prevalent disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), and it can be observed in the field of radiological cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The prevalence of MS in Saudi Arabia has increased as compared to the past few years. MRI is the gold standard non-invasive modality of choice in MS diagnosis according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), New York City. This study aimed to highlight the significance of using diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) and the use of contrast media in the MS protocol, as well as the importance of identifying the suitable time of imaging after contrast enhancement to detect active lesions.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted of 100 MS patients with an age range of 17 to 56 years. The data set included 41 active cases and 59 inactive cases. All patients had an MRI standard protocol of both the brain and spine in addition to DWI sequence and contrast agent (CA) injection, with images taken in early and delayed time.ResultsOf the patients, 71% were female and 29% were male. Active MS disease was more significant at younger ages than at older ages. Active lesions were significantly enhanced in delayed contrast images and showed high signal intensity in both the DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, while inactive lesions showed no enhancement after contrast injection and showed an iso-signal intensity in both the DWI and ADC map.ConclusionThe use of CA has developed over the years in the diagnosis of MS patients. In this study, the relationship between active lesions, DWI, and delayed contrast enhancement is very strong. In future research, we recommend adding a DWI sequence for the suspected active MS spine lesions in addition to delayed enhancement time in active MS after contrast injection to increase MRI sensitivity toward active MS lesions of the brain and spinal cord as well.

N2  -  Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of video electroencephalography (VEEG) combined with magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) in epilepsy. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, clinical data of 60 patients who underwent both VEEG and MRI examinations at the Neurosurgery Department of Quzhou People's Hospital from December 2020 to March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed, and a total of 55 patients were finally included. We evaluated the diagnostic value of combining VEEG and MRI to determine seizure type, location of epileptic focus, and structural abnormalities of brain tissue, using surgical and pathological results as the gold standard. Results: The accuracy of the combined approach for determining the seizure type was 98.18%, which was higher than the accuracy of MRI (85.45%, P<0.05) or VEEG (81.82%, P<0.05) alone. The accuracy of joint examination for lesion location was 100.00%, which was higher than those of MRI (85.45%, P<0.05) or VEEG (83.64%, P<0.05) alone. Similar abnormal brain tissue structure detection rates was found for both MRI and VEEG (P>0.05). Conclusions: The application of MRI-DTI combined with VEEG to diagnose patients with epilepsy allows for the identification of abnormal structural changes in brain and the location of lesions. Combining both approaches can improve the diagnostic accuracy of each technique alone and provide a reference for the formulation and adjustment of disease management plans.

N2  -  The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tissue provides an indication of the size, shape, and orientation of the water spaces in tissue. Thus, pathologic differences between lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with different clinical courses may be reflected by changes in ADC measurements in lesions and white matter. Twelve healthy subjects and 35 MS patients with a relapsing-remitting (n = 10), benign (n = 8), secondary progressive (n 8) and primary progressive (n = 9) clinical course were studied, T(2)-weighted and post-gadolinium T(1)-weighted images were obtained using a 1.5 T Signa Echospeed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Diffusion-weighted imaging was implemented using a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence with diffusion gradients applied in turn along three orthogonal directions in order to obtain the average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(av)), Navigator echo correction and cardiac gating were used to reduce motion artifact, ADC maps were derived using a two point calculation based on the Stejskal-Tanner formula. Diffusion anisotropy was estimated using the van Gelderen formula to calculate an anisotropy index. MS lesions had a higher ADC and reduced anisotropy compared with normal appearing white matter. Highest ADC values were found in gadolinium enhancing lesions and non-enhancing hypointense lesions on T(1)-weighted imaging. MS white matter had a slightly higher ADC and lower anisotropy than white matter of healthy subjects. Lesion and white matter ADC values did not differ between patients with different clinical courses of MS. There was no correlation between lesion ADC and disability. Diffusion-weighted imaging with measurement of ADC using the PGSE method provides quantitative information on acute edematous MS lesions and chronic lesions associated with demyelination and axonal loss but does not distinguish between clinical subtypes of MS.

N2  -  Motor outcome is variable following neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS). We analyzed the relationship between lesion characteristics on brain MRI and motor function in children who had suffered from NAIS. Thirty eight full term born children with unilateral NAIS were investigated at the age of seven. 3D T1- and 3D FLAIR-weighted MR images were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Lesion characteristics were compared between patients with and without cerebral palsy (CP) using the following approaches: lesion localization either using a category-based analysis, lesion mapping as well as voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Using diffusion-weighted imaging the microstructure of the cortico-spinal tract (CST) was related to the status of CP by measuring DTI parameters. Whereas children with lesions sparing the primary motor system did not develop CP, CP was always present when extensive lesions damaged at least two brain structures involving the motor system. The VLSM approach provided a statistical map that confirmed the cortical lesions in the primary motor system and revealed that CP was highly correlated with lesions in close proximity to the CST. In children with CP, diffusion parameters indicated microstructural changes in the CST at the level of internal capsule and the centrum semiovale. White matter damage of the CST in centrum semiovale was a highly reproducible marker of CP. This is the first description of the implication of this latter region in motor impairment after NAIS. In conclusion, CP in childhood was closely linked to the location of the infarct in the motor system. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  This study aims to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model to differentiate glioblastoma from single brain metastasis (BM) using conventional MRI combined with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Preoperative conventional MRI and DWI of 202 patients with solitary brain tumor (104 glioblastoma and 98 BM) were retrospectively obtained between February 2016 and September 2022. The data were divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. An additional 32 patients (19 glioblastoma and 13 BM) from a different hospital were considered testing set. Single-MRI-sequence DL models were developed using the 3D residual network-18 architecture in tumoral (T model) and tumoral + peritumoral regions (T&P model). Furthermore, the combination model based on conventional MRI and DWI was developed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the classification performance. The attention area of the model was visualized as a heatmap by gradient-weighted class activation mapping technique. For the single-MRI-sequence DL model, the T2WI sequence achieved the highest AUC in the validation set with either T models (0.889) or T&P models (0.934). In the combination models of the T&P model, the model of DWI combined with T2WI and contrast-enhanced T1WI showed increased AUC of 0.949 and 0.930 compared with that of single-MRI sequences in the validation set, respectively. And the highest AUC (0.956) was achieved by combined contrast-enhanced T1WI, T2WI, and DWI. In the heatmap, the central region of the tumoral was hotter and received more attention than other areas and was more important for differentiating glioblastoma from BM. A conventional MRI-based DL model could differentiate glioblastoma from solitary BM, and the combination models improved classification performance.

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis and aquaporin-4 antibody neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are distinct autoimmune CNS disorders with overlapping clinical features but differing pathology. Multiple sclerosis is primarily a demyelinating disease with the presence of widespread axonal damage, while neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders is characterized by astrocyte injury with secondary demyelination. Diagnosis is typically based on lesion characteristics observed on standard MRI imaging and antibody testing but can be challenging in patients with in-between clinical presentations. Non-conventional MRI techniques can provide valuable diagnostic information by measuring disease processes at the microstructural level. We used non-conventional MRI to measure markers of axonal loss in specific white matter tracts in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, depending on their relationship with focal lesions. Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (n = 20), aquaporin-4 antibody-associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) underwent a 3T brain MRI, including T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted sequences, quantitative susceptibility mapping and phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence. Tractometry was used to differentiate tract fibres traversing through white matter lesions from those that did not. Neurite density index was assessed using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model. Cortical damage was evaluated using T1 relaxation rates. Cortical lesions and paramagnetic rim lesions were identified using phase-sensitive inversion recovery and quantitative susceptibility mapping. In tracts traversing lesions, only one out of 50 tracts showed a decreased neurite density index in multiple sclerosis compared with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Among 50 tracts not traversing lesions, six showed reduced neurite density in multiple sclerosis (including three in the cerebellum and brainstem) compared to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. In multiple sclerosis, reduced neurite density was found in the majority of fibres traversing (40/50) and not traversing (37/50) white matter lesions when compared to healthy controls. A negative correlation between neurite density in lesion-free fibres and cortical lesions, but not paramagnetic rim lesions, was observed in multiple sclerosis (39/50 tracts). In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders compared to healthy controls, decreased neurite density was observed in a subset of fibres traversing white matter lesions, but not in lesion-free fibres. In conclusion, we identified significant differences between multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders corresponding to their distinct pathologies. Specifically, in multiple sclerosis, neurite density reduction was widespread across fibres, regardless of their relationship to white matter lesions, while in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, this reduction was limited to fibres passing through white matter lesions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the discriminatory potential of neurite density measures in white matter tracts for differentiating multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.
Jakuszyk et al. report that a decrease in neurite density index measured by magnetic resonance imaging is observed in white matter tracts in multiple sclerosis regardless of whether tracts traverse or not traverse white matter lesions, while in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, it is only limited to tracts traversing through lesions.; Graphical Abstract

N2  -  Structural connectome measurement combined with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tractography allows generation of a whole-brain connectome. However, current cortical structural connectivity (SC) measurements have not been well combined with the vertex-wise multi-subjects statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using group comparison vertex-wise analysis for cortical SC measurement. A fiber connectivity density (FiCD) method based on a combination of a diffusion fiber tracking technique and cortical surface-based analysis was used to measure the whole-brain cortical SC map (FiCD map). A public MRI data set (GigaDB) was employed to evaluate the reproducibility of the FiCD method. For group comparison, 14 post-stroke patients (mean age, 68.36 +/- 7.33 y) and 19 healthy participants (mean age, 66.84 +/- 8.58 y) had FiCD measurement. The intergroup comparison of the FiCD map was performed using vertex-wise multi-subject statistical analysis. Reliability testing showed the mean intra-and inter-subject FiCD variability was 3.51 +/- 2.12% and 19.44 +/- 4.79%, respectively. The group comparison of the whole-brain FiCD identified cortical regions with altered FiCD values, and there was a spatial consistency between the cortical clusters with low FiCD values and the subcortical lesions of patients. This study demonstrated the feasibility of vertex-wise group comparison for evaluating cortical fiber connectivity density. The FiCD method has good intra-and inter-individual reproducibility, and accurately reflects the affected cortical regions in post-stroke patients. This method may be helpful for neuroscience research. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background From a surgical perspective, presurgical prediction of meningioma consistency is beneficial.
Purpose To quantitatively analyze the correlation between the magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity (SI) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and meningioma consistency and to determine which MR sequence could help predicting hard meningiomas.; Material and Method This study included 43 patients with meningiomas who underwent preoperative MR imaging (MRI), including T1-weighted (T1W) imaging, T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), contrast-enhanced (CE)-T1W imaging, and CE-fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA). A neurosurgeon evaluated the tumor consistency using a visual analog scale (VAS) with the anchors soft (score=0) and hard (score=10). The SI ratio (tumor to cerebral cortex SI) and ADC value were compared with the tumor consistency. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for predicting hard meningiomas (VAS score 8; 9 of 43 patients) were calculated using cutoff values for the SI ratio that were obtained in a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; Results A significant negative correlation was observed between the tumor consistency and the SI ratio on T2W imaging, FLAIR, and CE-FIESTA (P<0.05) but not on T1W imaging, CE-T1W imaging, and the ADC value. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for predicting hard meningiomas were 89%, 79%, and 81% with T2W imaging; 89%, 76%, and 79% with FLAIR; and 100%, 74%, and 79% with CE-FIESTA, respectively.; Conclusion Our results suggest that a quantitative assessment using conventional T2W imaging or FLAIR may be a simple and useful method for predicting hard meningiomas.

N2  -  Objective. Stroke survivors with motor deficits often have pyramidal tract atrophy caused by degeneration of corticospinal fibers. The authors hypothesized that the degree of atrophy correlates with severity of motor impairment in patients with chronic stroke and predicts the response to rehabilitation training. Methods. They performed a post hoc analysis of 42 hemiparetic patients (>6 months) who had been randomized to either 6 weeks of bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) or dose-matched therapeutic exercise (DMTE). Arm function was measured using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) and modified Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on the pontine level measured corticospinal tract (CST) atrophy by planimetric measurement of the mesencephalon (mesencephalic atrophy ratio) and fractional anisotropy (FA), respectively. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) was used to determine the lesions associated with highest degrees of atrophy. The predictive value of CST atrophy for impairment and training response was analyzed. Results. CST atrophy predicted baseline motor arm function measured by the FM and WMFT. The authors found only a trend for the correlation with FA. No measure of atrophy predicted response to either BATRAC or DMTE. CST atrophy was higher with larger lesions and those that affected the CST. VLSM identified internal capsule lesions as being associated with highest CST atrophy. Conclusion. Larger lesions, internal capsule lesions, and those overlapping the pyramidal tract are associated with greater CST atrophy. CST atrophy explains in part the variability of baseline deficits but does not seem to predict the response to BATRAC or unilateral arm training on upper-extremity function.

N2  -  This study aims to assess the diagnostic value of multivoxel 2D chemical-shift imaging (CSI) proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy combined with perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the differential diagnosis and grading of brain tumors by comparing neuroimaging data with histopathological findings obtained after resection or biopsy.
A total of 159 patients with a previous brain tumor diagnosis underwent multivoxel 2D CSI proton MR spectroscopy and perfusion MRI. MR spectroscopy multivoxel 2D CSI was performed with an echo time of 30, TR 1,500, FOV 160 mm, acquisition time 7 min 34 s. rCBV maps were evaluated during postprocessing. Statistical analysis was performed on the examination of distributive normality, with logarithmic transformations, Fisher's test, and Bonferroni's test. We used the Pearson's test to compare percentages.; In the differential diagnosis between GBM and metastases, MR spectroscopy multivoxel 2D CSI, combined with dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) perfusion, reached high sensibility and specificity (p < 0.000001). In brain tumor grading, the same method reached high sensibility and specificity (p < 0.000001) in distinguishing grade III-IV gliomas but encountered difficulty in determining grades within the two main groups of primary brain tumors, especially where mixed gliomas were involved.; The systematic use of CSI spectroscopy and perfusion imaging has shown a high potential in the differential diagnosis and grading of brain tumors. Further exploration into diagnostic procedures that can significantly distinguish between grade III-IV and grade II tumors is needed.

N2  -  Radiation therapy (RT) has been widely used as a powerful treatment tool to address cancerous tissues because of its ability to control cell growth. Its ionizing radiation damages the DNA of cancerous tissues, leading to cell death. Medical imaging, however, still has limitations regarding the reliability of its assessment of tissue response and in predicting the treatment effect because of its inability to provide contrast information on the gradual, minute tissue changes after RT. A recently developed magnetic resonance (MR)-based conductivity imaging method may provide direct, highly sensitive information on this tissue response because its contrast mechanism is based on the concentration and mobility of ions in intracellular and extracellular spaces. In this feasibility study, we applied T2- weighted, diffusion-weighted, and electrical conductivity imaging to mouse brain, thus, using the MR imaging to map the tissue response after radiation exposure. To evaluate the degree of response, we measured the T2 relaxation, apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC), and electrical conductivity of brain tissues before and after irradiation. The conductivity images, which showed significantly higher sensitivity than other MR imaging methods, indicated that the contrast is distinguishable in different ways at different areas of the brain. Future studies will focus on verifying these results and the long-term evaluation of conductivity changes using various irradiation methods for clinical applications.

N2  -  There is great interest in the study of brain structural connectivity, as white matter abnormalities have been implicated in many disease states. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a powerful means to characterise structural connectivity non-invasively, by using a fibre-tracking algorithm. The most widely used fibre-tracking strategy is based on the step-wise generation of streamlines. Despite their popularity and widespread use, there are a number of practical considerations that must be taken into account in order to increase the robustness of streamlines tracking results, particularly when these methods are used to study brain structural connectivity, and the connectome. This review article describes what we consider the 'seven deadly sins' of mapping structural connections using diffusion MRI streamlines fibre-tracking, with particular emphasis on 'sins' that can be practically avoided and they can have an important impact in the results. It is shown that there are important 'deadly sins' to be avoided at every step of the pipeline, such as during data acquisition, during data modelling to estimate local fibre architecture, during the fibre-tracking process itself, and during quantification of the tracking results. The recommendations here are intended to inform users on potential important shortcomings of their current tracking protocols, as well as to guide future users on some of the key issues and decisions that must be faced when designing their processing pipelines.

N2  -  Intraoperative 3D recognition of the motor tract is indispensable to avoiding neural fiber injury in brain tumor surgery. However, precise localization of the tracts is sometimes difficult with conventional mapping methods. Thus, the authors developed a novel brain mapping method that enables the 3D recognition of the motor tract for intrinsic brain tumor surgeries. This technique was performed in 40 consecutive patients with gliomas adjacent to motor tracts that have a risk of intraoperative pyramidal tract damage. Motor tracts were electrically stimulated and identified by a handheld brain-mapping probe, the NY Tract Finder (NYTF). Sixteen-gauge plastic tubes were mounted onto the NYTF and inserted in the estimated direction of the motor tract with reference to navigational information. Only the NYTF was removed, leaving the plastic tubes in their places, immediately after muscle motor evoked potentials were recorded at the minimum stimulation current. Motor tracts were electrically identified in all cases. Three-dimensional information on the position of motor tracts was given by plastic tubes that were neurophysiologically placed. Tips of tubes showed the resection limit during tumor removal. Safe tumor resection with an arbitrary safety margin can be performed by adjusting the length of the plastic tubes. The motor tract positioning method enabled the 3D recognition of the motor tract by surgeons and provided for safe resection of tumors. Tumor resections were performed safely before damaging motor tracts, without any postoperative neurological deterioration.

N2  -  The Translational Brain Mapping Program at the University of Rochester is an interdisciplinary effort that integrates cognitive science, neurophysiology, neuroanesthesia, and neurosurgery. Patients who have tumors or epileptogenic tissue in eloquent brain areas are studied preoperatively with functional and structural MRI, and intraoperatively with direct electrical stimulation mapping. Post-operative neural and cognitive outcome measures fuel basic science studies about the factors that mediate good versus poor outcome after surgery, and how brain mapping can be further optimized to ensure the best outcome for future patients. In this article, we describe the interdisciplinary workflow that allows our team to meet the synergistic goals of optimizing patient outcome and advancing scientific understanding of the human brain.

N2  -  Objective: It is often difficult to decide whether a cystic brain lesion is a tumor or an abscess by means of conventional MRI techniques. The immediate diagnosis of a brain abscess is important for the patient's outcome. Our goal was to study the ability of diffusion-weighted imaging and calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to differentiate between these two pathologies. Patients and Methods: Ten patients (five men, five women) with cystic brain lesions were examined with MRI. The ADC maps were calculated for each subject and the ADC value of each lesion was measured. Histology revealed glioblastoma multiforme in six patients and abscess in four patients. Results: All brain abscesses showed markedly hyperintense signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging, whereas the appearance of glioblastoma varied from slightly hyperintense to hypointense signal conversion. The mean ADC value calculated in the six patients with cystic brain tumor was: 2.05 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (1.38-2.88 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). The mean ADC value of the four patients with brain abscess was: 0.57 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (0.38-0.77 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted imaging and calculation of ADC maps constitute a helpful tool to differentiate between cystic brain tumors and brain abscesses.

N2  -  Microwave heating is a promising technique for hyperthermia treatment of tumors, but is not yet a standard clinical method. Problems include the inability to control automatically and noninvasively the temporal and spatial temperature behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to map thermal changes via phase shifts in gradient-echo images and has recently been incorporated into simple feedback systems for ultrasound heating. In this paper, we show the first demonstration of closed-loop feedback control of microwave heating using MRI-derived maps of both temperature and specific absorption rate as the inputs to a feedback algorithm.

N2  -  Background:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by focal white matter damage, and when the brain is modeled as a network, lesions can be treated as disconnection events.; Objective:; To evaluate whether modeling disconnection caused by lesions helps explain motor and cognitive impairment in MS.; Methods:; Pathways connecting 116 cortical regions were reconstructed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography from diffusion tensors averaged across healthy controls (HCs); maps of pathways were applied to 227 relapse-onset MS patients and 50 HCs to derive structural connectivity. Then, the likelihood of individual connections passing through lesions was used to model disconnection. Patients were grouped according to clinical phenotype (113 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 69 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), 45 benign MS), and then network metrics were compared between groups (analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and correlated with motor and cognitive scores (linear regression).; Results:; Global metrics differentiated RRMS from SPMS and benign MS patients, but not benign from SPMS patients. Nodal connectivity strength replicated global results. After disconnection, few nodes were significantly different between benign MS and RRMS patients. Correlations revealed nodes pertinent to motor and cognitive dysfunctions; these became slightly stronger after disconnection.; Conclusion:; Connectivity did not change greatly after modeled disconnection, suggesting that the brain network is robust against damage caused by MS lesions.

N2  -  New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can provide information on tissue status and the pathophysiology in acute stroke. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is sensitive to changes of water mobility and detects cytotoxic cell swelling, an early event in the cascade of ischemic tissue change, before T-2-weighted MRI shows any abnormality. It provides a higher lesion-to-noise contrast than conventional MRI facilitating lesion detection in early stages of stroke and allows differentiation of acute and chronic tissue pathology. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), a quantitative measure of water diffusion, undergoes dynamic changes following the hyperacute and acute stages of stroke offering an unique opportunity in visualising the pathology of acute and chronic ischemia. Dynamic contrast enhanced T-2*-weighted MRI, also known as perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), is a semiquantitative MRI technique of tissue perfusion that provides complementary hemodynamic information in acute stroke. The combination of DWI and PWI enables the identification of the tissue at risk to undergo infarction in the penumbral region of acute ischemia. MR angiography provides information on the presence and site of arterial vessel pathology that is of particular value in very early stroke cases with negative DWI. DWI and PWI are new tools in stroke research. In a clinical setting they improve diagnostic accuracy in acute neurological disorders. They facilitate lesion localisation, the staging of acute stroke and provide pathophysiological information. DWI and PWI have the potential to become the main diagnostic neuroimaging procedures in stroke patients influencing clinical decision making.

N2  -  Rationale:The main clinical symptoms of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are dehydration, acidosis, nervous system symptoms and intellectual disability. The brain imaging findings were mainly caused by cytotoxic edema. The lesions usually occur at the site consistent with the myelination process of normal neonates. The distribution is mostly symmetric, and the diffusion is obviously limited. Patient concerns:Herein, we report a rare case of an 8-day-old female patient who presented with abnormal symptoms, such as difficulty eating, convulsions, slow reaction, difficulty in correcting hypoglycemia and severe metabolic disorders. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal signal intensity mainly involving the brainstem, cervical spinal cord, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalamus, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus with characteristic hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence. MSUD is rarely reported, while cervical spinal cord involvement is extremely rare. Diagnoses:Blood tandem mass spectrometry, urine organic acid detection, and genetic disease overall genetic tests were performed to further confirm the diagnosis of MSUD. Interventions:Under general anesthesia, she underwent open surgical procedures for liver transplantation. Outcomes:The child was in a stable condition after liver transplantation, and the diet was not restricted. Lessons:MSUD in neonates is rare. Our case report and literature review was aim to describe the clinic and imaging characteristics of it, and highlight physicians must be aware of this entity in newborns so as to reduce misdiagnosis due to unfamiliarity.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS) has been used to estimate diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume in acute stroke. We aimed to assess correlations of DWI-ASPECTS with lesion volume in different middle cerebral artery (MCA) subregions and reproduce existing ASPECTS thresholds of a malignant profile defined by lesion volume >= 100 mL.
Methods-We analyzed data of patients with MCA stroke from a prospective observational study of DWI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in acute stroke. DWI-ASPECTS and lesion volume were calculated. The population was divided into subgroups based on lesion localization (superficial MCA territory, deep MCA territory, or both). Correlation of ASPECTS and infarct volume was calculated, and receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal ASPECTS threshold for >= 100-mL lesion volume.; Results-A total of 496 patients were included. There was a significant negative correlation between ASPECTS and DWI lesion volume (r=-0.78; P<0.0001). With regards to lesion localization, correlation was weaker in deep MCA region (r=-0.19; P=0.038) when compared with superficial (r=-0.72; P<0.001) or combined superficial and deep MCA lesions (r=-0.72; P<0.001). Receiver-operating characteristics analysis revealed ASPECTS <= 6 as best cutoff to identify >= 100-mL DWI lesion volume; however, positive predictive value was low (0.35).; Conclusions-ASPECTS has limitations when lesion location is not considered. Identification of patients with malignant profile by DWI-ASPECTS may be unreliable. ASPECTS may be a useful tool for the evaluation of noncontrast computed tomography. However, if MRI is used, ASPECTS seems dispensable because lesion volume can easily be quantified on DWI maps.

N2  -  For more than a decade neurosurgeons have become increasingly dependent on image guidance to perforin safe, efficient, and cost-effective surgery. Neuronavigation is frame-based or frameless and requires obtaining computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans several days or immediately before surgery. Unfortunately, these systems do not allow the neurosurgeon to adjust for the brain shift that occurs once the cranium is open. This technical inability has led to the development of intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) systems ranging from 0.12-3.0T in strength. The advantages of ioMRI are the excellent soft tissue discrimination and the ability to view the operative site in three dimensions. Enhanced visualization of the intracranial lesion enables the neurosurgeon to choose a safe surgical trajectory that avoids critical structures, to maximize the extent of the tumor resection, and to exclude an intraoperative hemorrhage. All ioMRI systems provide basic T1- and T2-weighted imaging capabilities but high-field (1.5T) systems can also perform MR spectroscopy (MRS), MR venography (MRV), MR angiography (MRA), brain activation studies, chemical shift imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Identifying vascular structures by MRA or MRV may prevent injury during surgery. Demonstrating elevated phosphocholine within a tumor may improve the diagnostic yield of brain biopsy. Mapping out neurologic function may influence the surgical approach to a tumor. The optimal strength for MR-guided neurosurgery is currently under investigation.

N2  -  Advanced intraoperative MR images (ioMRI) acquired during the resection of pediatric brain tumors could offer additional physiological information to preserve healthy tissue. With this work, we aimed to develop a protocol for ioMRI with increased sensitivity for arterial spin labeling (ASL) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), optimized for patient positioning regularly used in the pediatric neurosurgery setting. For ethical reasons, ASL images were acquired in healthy adult subjects that were imaged in the prone and supine position. After this, the ASL cerebral blood flow (CBF) was quantified and compared between both positions. To evaluate the impact of the RF coils setups on image quality, we compared different setups (two vs. four RF coils) by looking at T1-weighted (T1w) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), as well as undertaking a qualitative evaluation of T1w, T2w, ASL, and dMR images. Mean ASL CBF did not differ between the surgical prone and supine positions in any of the investigated regions of interest or the whole brain. T1w SNR (gray matter: p = 0.016, 34% increase; white matter: p = 0.016, 32% increase) and CNR were higher (p = 0.016) in the four versus two RF coils setups (18.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 13.9 +/- 1.8). Qualitative evaluation of T1w, T2w, ASL, and dMR images resulted in acceptable to good image quality and did not differ statistically significantly between setups. Only the nonweighted diffusion image maps and corticospinal tract reconstructions yielded higher image quality and reduced susceptibility artifacts with four RF coils. Advanced ioMRI metrics were more precise with four RF coils as the standard deviation decreased. Taken together, we have investigated the practical use of advanced ioMRI during pediatric neurosurgery. We conclude that ASL CBF quantification in the surgical prone position is valid and that ASL and dMRI acquisition with two RF coils can be performed adequately for clinical use. With four versus two RF coils, the SNR of the images increases, and the sensitivity to artifacts reduces.

N2  -  Gradient-echo pulse sequences with velocity-encoding gradients of 22.5-25 mT/m, were used for brain-motion and CSF-flow studies, To reduce motion artifacts, a phase-correction technique based on navigator echoes was evaluated, Three patients with right-sided parietal tumours were investigated; one astrocytoma grade III-IV, one astrocytoma grade I-II and one benign meningioma, In healthy volunteers, a maximal brain-tissue velocity of (0.94 +/- 0.26) mm/s (mean +/- 1SD) was observed, which is consistent with previously presented results, The phase correction was proven useful for reduction of artifacts due to external head movements in modulus and phase images, without loss of phase information related to internal motion, The tissue velocity within the astrocytomas was low during the entire cardiac cycle, An abnormally high rostral velocity component was, however, observed in the brain tissue frontal to the astrocytomas. In all patients, an abnormal CSF flow pattern was observed, The study of brain motion may provide further understanding of the effects of tumours and other pathological conditions in the brain, When considering intracranial motion as a source of error in diffusion/perfusion MRI, the present study suggests that a pathology can alter the properties of brain motion and CSF flow considerably, leading to a more complex impact on diffusion/perfusion images, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  -  Patients with striate cortex lesions experience visual perception loss in the contralateral visual field. In few patients, however, stimuli within the blind field can lead to unconscious (blindsight) or even conscious perception when the stimuli are moving (Riddoch syndrome). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural responses elicited by motion stimulation in the sighted and blind visual fields of eight patients with lesions of the striate cortex. Importantly, repeated testing ensured that none of the patients exhibited blindsight or a Riddoch syndrome. Three patients had additional lesions in the ipsilesional pulvinar. For blind visual field stimulation, great care was given that the moving stimulus was precisely presented within the borders of the scotoma. In six of eight patients, the stimulation within the scotoma elicited hemodynamic activity in area human middle temporal (hMT) while no activity was observed within the ipsilateral lesioned area of the striate cortex. One of the two patients in whom no ipsilesional activity was observed had an extensive lesion including massive subcortical damage. The other patient had an additional focal lesion within the lateral inferior pulvinar. Fiber-tracking based on anatomical and functional markers (hMT and Pulvinar) on individual diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from each patient revealed the structural integrity of subcortical pathways in all but the patient with the extensive subcortical lesion. These results provide clear evidence for the robustness of direct subcortical pathways from the pulvinar to area hMT in patients with striate cortex lesions and demonstrate that ipsilesional activity in area hMT is completely independent of conscious perception.

N2  -  To define K-trans and fractional anisotropy (FA) thresholds in correlation to histology for improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tumor assessment in an animal model of brain glioma.
Twelve rats underwent 4.7 T MRI at day 10 after tumor implantation. Anatomical scans (T-2, T-1 at 8 min after double dose contrast application) as well as dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging with calculation of K-trans and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with calculation of FA were performed. T-2- and T-1-derived tumor volumes were calculated and thresholds for K-trans and FA were defined for best MRI tumor assessment correlated to histology.; Tumor volumes were 159 +- 14 mm(3) (histology), 126 +- 26 mm(3) (T-1 with contrast, r = 0.76), and 153 +- 12 mm(3) (T-2, r = 0.84), respectively. K-trans- and FA-derived tumor volumes were 160 +- 16 mm(3) (for K-trans A(3) 0.04 min(-1), r = 0.94), and 159 A +- 14 mm(3) (for FA A  pound 0.14, r = 0.96), respectively.; DCE-MRI and DTI with calculation of K-trans and FA maps allow very precise brain glioma assessment comparable to histology if established thresholds for the given tumor model are used.

N2  -  The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of newly developed, advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques (spectroscopy, diffusion and perfusion imaging) in diagnosing brain gliomas, with special reference to histological typing and grading, treatment planning and posttreatment follow-up. Conventional MR imaging enables the detection and localisation of neoplastic lesions, as well as providing, in typical cases, some indication about their nature. However, it has limited sensitivity and specificity in evaluating histological type and grade, delineating margins and differentiating oedema, tumour and treatment side-effects. These limitations can be overcome by supplementing the morphological data obtained with conventional MR imaging with the metabolic, structural and perfusional information provided by new MR techniques that are increasingly becoming an integral part of routine MR studies. Incorporation of such new MR techniques can lead to more comprehensive and precise diagnoses that can better assist surgeons in determining prognosis and planning treatment strategies. In addition, the recent development of new, more effective, treatments for cerebral glioma strongly relies on morphofunctional MR imaging with its ability to provide a biological interpretation of these characteristically heterogeneous tumours.

N2  -  Hemispherectomy is often followed by remarkable recovery of cognitive and motor functions. This reflects plastic capacities of the remaining hemisphere, involving large-scale structural and functional adaptations. Better understanding of these adaptations may (1) provide new insights in the neuronal configuration and rewiring that underlies sensorimotor outcome restoration, and (2) guide development of rehabilitation strategies to enhance recovery after hemispheric lesioning. We assessed brain structure and function in a hemispherectomy model. With MRI we mapped changes in white matter structural integrity and gray matter functional connectivity in eight hemispherectomized rats, compared with 12 controls. Behavioral testing involved sensorimotor performance scoring. Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired 7 and 49 days post surgery. Hemispherectomy caused significant sensorimotor deficits that largely recovered within 2 weeks. During the recovery period, fractional anisotropy was maintained and white matter volume and axial diffusivity increased in the contralateral cerebral peduncle, suggestive of preserved or improved white matter integrity despite overall reduced white matter volume. This was accompanied by functional adaptations in the contralateral sensorimotor network. The observed white matter modifications and reorganization of functional network regions may provide handles for rehabilitation strategies improving functional recovery following large lesions.

N2  -  This study reports T-2 and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of a mild open-skull, controlled cortical impact injury in rats (n=6) from 3 h to up to 14 d after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Comparison was made with longitudinal behavioral measurements and end-point histology. The impact was applied over the left primary forelimb somatosensory cortex (S1FL). The major findings were: 1) In the S1FL, T-2 increased and fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased at 3 h after TBI and gradually returned toward normal by Day 14; 2) in the S1FL, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) increased at 3 h, peaked on Day 2, and gradually returned toward normal at Day 14; 3) in the corpus callosum underneath the S1FL, FA decreased at 3 h to Day 2 but returned to normal at Day 7 and 14, whereas T-2 and ADC were normal throughout; 4) heterogeneous hyperintense and hypointense T-2 map intensities likely indicated the presence of hemorrhage but were not independently verified; 5) lesion volumes defined by abnormal T-2, ADC, and FA showed similar temporal patterns, peaking around Day 2 and returning toward normal on Day 14; 6) the temporal profiles of lesion volumes were consistent with behavioral scores assessed by forelimb placement and forelimb foot fault tests; and 7) at 14 d post-TBI, there was substantial tissue recovery by MRI, which could either reflect true tissue recovery or reabsorption of edema. Histology performed 14 d post-TBI, however, showed a small cavitation and significant neuronal degeneration surrounding the cavitation in S1FL. Thus, the observed improvement of behavioral scores likely involves both functional recovery and functional compensation.

N2  -  Background: Perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the evaluation of brain tumors. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) is usually obtained by dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI using normal appearing white matter as reference region. The emerging perfusion technique arterial spin labelling (ASL) presently provides measurement only of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which has not been widely used in human brain tumor studies.
Purpose: To assess if measurement of blood flow is comparable with measurement of blood volume in human biopsy-proven gliomas obtained by DSC-MRI using two different regions for normalization and two different measurement approaches.; Material and Methods: Retrospective study of 61 patients with different types of gliomas examined with DSC perfusion MRI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in tumor portions with maximum perfusion on rCBF and rCBV maps, with contralateral normal appearing white matter and cerebellum as reference regions. Larger ROIs were drawn for histogram analyses. The type and grade of the gliomas were obtained by histopathology. Statistical comparison was made between diffuse astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas.; Results: rCBF and rCBV measurements obtained with the maximum perfusion method were correlated when normalized to white matter (r = 0.60) and to the cerebellum (r = 0.49). Histogram analyses of rCBF and rCBV showed that mean and median values as well as skewness and peak position were correlated (0.61 < r < 0.93), whereas for kurtosis and peak height, the correlation coefficient was about 0.3 when comparing rCBF and rCBV values for the same reference region. Neither rCBF nor rCBV quantification provided a statistically significant difference between the three types of gliomas. However, both rCBF and rCBV tended to increase with tumor grade and to be lower in patients who had undergone resectiontreatment.; Conclusion: rCBF measurements normalized to white matter or cerebellum are comparable with the established rCBV measurements used for the clinical evaluation of cerebral gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND In this study, we visualized the eloquent motor system including the somatosensory-motor cortex and corticospinal tract on a neuronavigation system, integrating magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and anisotropic diffusion-weighted MRI (ADWI).
METHODS Four patients with brain lesions adjacent to the eloquent motor system were studied. Motor-evoked responses (MER) by finger-tapping paradigm were acquired with a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner, and somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEF) by median nerve stimulation were measured with a 204-channel MEG system. In the same fMRI examination, ADWI and anatomic three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging (3-D MRI) were obtained. Activated areas of MER, estimated SEF dipoles, and the corticospinal tract on ADWI were coregistered to 3-D MRI, and the combined MR data were transferred to a neuronavigation system (functional neuronavigation). Intraoperative recording of cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials was performed for confirmation of the central sulcus.; RESULTS Combination of fMRI and MEG enabled firm identification of the central sulcus. Functional neuronavigation facilitated extensive tumor resection, having the advantage of sparing the motor cortex and corticospinal tract in all cases.; CONCLUSIONS The proposed functional neuronavigation allows neuro-surgeons to perform effective and maximal resection of brain lesions, identifying and sparing eloquent cortical components and their subcortical connections. Potential clinical application of this technique is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Despite early diagnosis, one-third of Amish infants with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (GAI) develop striatal lesions that leave them permanently disabled. To better understand mechanisms of striatal degeneration, we retrospectively studied imaging results from 25 Amish GAI patients homozygous for 1296C>T mutations in GCDH. Asymptomatic infants had reduced glucose tracer uptake and increased blood volume throughout gray matter, which may signify a predisposition to brain injury. Nine children (36%) developed striatal lesions: three had sudden motor regression during infancy whereas six had insidious motor delay associated with striatal lesions of undetermined onset. Acute striatal necrosis consisted of three stages: (1) an acute stage, within 24 h of motor regression, characterized by cytotoxic oedema within the basal ganglia, cerebral oligemia, and rapid transit of blood throughout gray matter; (2) a sub-acute stage, 4-5 days after the onset of clinical signs, characterized by reduced striatal perfusion and glucose uptake, and supervening vasogenic oedema; and (3) a chronic stage of striatal atrophy. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps revealed that at least two of the six patients with insidious motor delay suffered striatal injuries before or shortly after birth, followed by latent periods of several months before disability was apparent. Thus, acute and insidious presentations may occur by similar mechanisms, and differ only with regard to the timing of injury. Intravenous fluid and dextrose therapy for illnesses during the first 2 years of life was the only intervention that was clearly neuroprotective in this cohort (odds ratio for brain injury = 0.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.01-0.34; P < 0.001).

T2  -  CONCEPTS IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE PART A

N2  -  Diffusion weighted imaging has opened new diagnostic possibilities by using microscopic diffusion of water molecules as a means of image contrast. The directional dependence of diffusion has led to the development of diffusion tensor imaging, which allows us to characterize microscopic tissue geometry. The link between the measured NMR signal and the self-diffusion tensor is established by the so-called b matrices that depend on the gradient's direction, strength, and timing. However, in the calculation of b-matrix elements, the influence of imaging gradients on each element of the b matrix is often neglected. This may cause errors, which in turn leads to an incorrect extraction of diffusion coefficients. In cases where the imaging gradients are high (high spatial resolution), these errors may be substantial. Using a generic pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) imaging sequence, the effects of neglecting the imaging gradients on the b-matrix calculation are demonstrated. By measuring an isotropic phantom with this sequence it can be analytically as well as experimentally shown that large deviations in single b-matrix elements are generated. These deviations are obtained by applying the diffusion weighting in the readout direction of the imaging dimension in combination with relatively large imaging gradients. The systematic errors can be avoided by a full b-matrix calculation considering all the gradients of the sequence or by generating cross-term free signals using the geometric average of two diffusion weighted images with opposite polarity. The importance of calculating the exact b matrices by the proposed methods is based on the fact that more precise diffusion parameters are obtained for extracting correct property maps, such as fractional anisotropy, volume ratio, or conductivity tensor maps.

N2  -  This study aimed to utilize high angular resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (HARDI) tractography in the mapping of the pathways of the cerebellum associated with posterior fossa tumors (infratentorial neoplasms) and to determine whether it is useful for preoperative and postoperative evaluation. Retrospective data from 30 patients (age 2-16 yr) with posterior fossa tumor (17 low grade, 13 high grade) and 30 age-sex-matched healthy controls were used. Structural and diffusion-weighted images were collected at a 3-tesla scanner. Tractography was performed using Diffusion Toolkit software, Q-ball model, FACT algorithm, and angle threshold of 45 degrees. Manually assessed regions of interest were placed to identify reconstructed fiber pathways passing through the superior, medial, and inferior cerebellar peduncles for the preoperative, postoperative, and healthy control groups. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and track volume measures were obtained and analyzed. Statistically significant differences were found between the preop/postop, preop/control, and postop/control comparisons for the volume of the tracts in both groups. Displacement and disruption of the pathways seemed to differ in relation to the severity of the tumor. The loss of pathways after the operation was associated with selective resection during surgery due to tumor infiltration. There were no FA differences but significantly higher ADC in low-grade tumors, and no difference in both FA and ADC in high-grade tumors. The effects of posterior fossa tumors on cerebellar peduncles and reconstructed pathways were successfully evaluated by HARDI tractography. The technique appears to be useful not only for preoperative but also for postoperative evaluation.

N2  -  Background. In tuberous sclerosis (TS), tubers usually involve the white matter. Diffusion tensor (DT) images are used to demonstrate white-matter tracts. Objective. To determine the changes in DT indices in supratentorial tubers and associated changes in the white-matter tracts adjacent to tubers in patients with TS. Materials and methods. The DT imaging indices, including first, second and third eigenvalues (EVs), apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white-matter lesions of tubers, were assessed in seven patients with TS exhibiting developmental delay and compared with controls. Results. EV1, EV2, EV3, ADC and FA of the white-matter lesions of tubers were significantly different from contralateral unremarkable regions of the brain and from controls (P<0.05). The number of frontal and parietal tubers was significantly negatively correlated with EV1 of the superior longitudinal fasciculi of TS patients (r=-0.60, P =0.04). In addition, TS patients had significantly larger ADCs in the corona radiata and sagittal stratum than the control subjects. EV3s of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and sagittal stratum were significantly more increased in the TS patients than in the control subjects. Conclusions. EV1, EV2, EV3, ADC and FA maps are potential tools for demonstrating cerebral white-matter changes owing to TS.

N2  -  Introduction: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is usually performed before injection of intravenous paramagnetic contrast medium. Occasionally, it may be necessary to perform or to repeat DWI after such administration. Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of intravenous gadodiamide (Gd [DTPA-BMA]) on DWI. Methods: DWI was performed on 88 brain lesions immediately before, immediately after, and 5-10 min following the end of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd [DTPA-BMA] administration. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the lesions, and the SNRs of normal brain tissue were calculated on b=0 s/mm(2) and b=1,000 s/mm(2) DW images. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the lesions were measured on ADC maps. A paired t-test was used to determine the significance of differences between the values before and after administration of contrast medium. Results: The lesions consisted of 23 intraaxial and 11 extraaxial masses, 19 ischemic strokes, 15 intracranial hemorrhages and 20 demyelinating lesions. Images before and after contrast administration were not significantly different regarding SNRs and CNRs on DWI. This statement was also true for strongly enhanced lesions. However, ADC values significantly decreased after contrast medium injection on early post-contrast DWI in normal brain tissue (1%, P < 0.049) and (3%, P < 0.008) in lesions. By contrast, on late images, ADC values were normalized. Conclusion: Contrast medium injection had significant and time-dependent effects on ADC values. Therefore, only pre-contrast and late DW images should be used in quantitative ADC studies.

N2  -  Background: We report the case of a chronic stroke patient (62 months after injury) showing total absence of motor activity evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of spared regions of the left motor cortex, but near-to-complete recovery of motor abilities in the affected hand.
Case presentation: Multimodal investigations included detailed TMS based motor mapping, motor evoked potentials (MEP), and Cortical Silent period (CSP) as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of motor activity, MRI based lesion analysis and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Tractography of corticospinal tract (CST). Anatomical analysis revealed a left hemisphere subinsular lesion interrupting the descending left CST at the level of the internal capsule. The absence of MEPs after intense TMS pulses to the ipsilesional M1, and the reversible suppression of ongoing electromyographic (EMG) activity (indexed by CSP) demonstrate a weak modulation of subcortical systems by the ipsilesional left frontal cortex, but an inability to induce efficient descending volleys from those cortical locations to right hand and forearm muscles. Functional MRI recordings under grasping and finger tapping patterns involving the affected hand showed slight signs of subcortical recruitment, as compared to the unaffected hand and hemisphere, as well as the expected cortical activations.; Conclusions: The potential sources of motor voluntary activity for the affected hand in absence of MEPs are discussed. We conclude that multimodal analysis may contribute to a more accurate prognosis of stroke patients.

N2  -  Background Several patients with language-eloquent gliomas face language deterioration postoperatively. Persistent aphasia is frequently associated with damage to subcortical language pathways. Underlying mechanisms still need to be better understood, complicating preoperative risk assessment. This study compared qualitative and quantitative functionally relevant subcortical differences pre- and directly postoperatively in glioma patients with and without aphasia. Methods Language-relevant cortical sites were defined using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) language mapping in 74 patients between 07/2016 and 07/2019. Post-hoc nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging tractography was used to compare a tract's pre- and postoperative visualization, volume and fractional anisotropy (FA), and the preoperative distance between tract and lesion and postoperative overlap with the resection cavity between the following groups: no aphasia (NoA), tumor- or previous resection induced aphasia persistent pre- and postoperatively (TIA_P), and surgery-induced transient or permanent aphasia (SIA_T or SIA_P). Results Patients with NoA, TIA_P, SIA_T, and SIA_P showed distinct fasciculus arcuatus (AF) and inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) properties. The AF was more frequently reconstructable, and the FA of IFOF was higher in NoA than TIA_P cases (all p <= 0.03). Simultaneously, SIA_T cases showed higher IFOF fractional anisotropy than TIA_P cases (p < 0.001) and the most considerable AF volume loss overall. While not statistically significant, the four SIA_P cases showed complete loss of ventral language streams postoperatively, the highest resection-cavity-AF-overlap, and the shortest AF to tumor distance. Conclusion Functionally relevant qualitative and quantitative differences in AF and IFOF provide a pre- and postoperative pathophysiological and clinically relevant diagnostic indicator that supports surgical risk stratification.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Regional differences in sensitivity to white matter damage after brain radiotherapy (RT) are not well-described. We characterized the spatial heterogeneity of dose-response across white matter tracts using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
Materials and methods: Forty-nine patients with primary brain tumors underwent MRI with DTI before and 9-12 months after partial-brain RT. Maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were generated. Atlas-based white matter tracts were identified. A secondary analysis using skeletonized tracts was also performed. Linear mixed-model analysis of the relationship between mean and max dose and percent change in DTI metrics was performed.; Results: Tracts with the strongest correlation of FA change with mean dose were the fornix (-0.46 percentGy), cingulum bundle (-0.44 percentGy), and body of corpus callosum (-0.23 percentGy), p < .001. These tracts also showed dose-sensitive changes in MD and RD. In the skeletonized analysis, the fornix and cingulum bundle remained highly dose-sensitive. Maximum and mean dose were similarly predictive of DTI change.; Conclusions: The corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, and fornix show the most prominent dose dependent changes following RT. Future studies examining correlation with cognitive functioning and potential avoidance of critical white matter regions are warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Cerebral energy deficiency is increasingly recognised as an important feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Until now, we have lacked non-invasive imaging methods to quantify energy utilisation and mitochondrial function in the human brain. Here, we used novel dual-calibrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (dc-fMRI) to map grey-matter (GM) deoxy-haemoglobin sensitive cerebral blood volume (CBVdHb), cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in patients with MS (PwMS) and age/sex matched controls. By integrating a flow-diffusion model of oxygen transport, we evaluated the effective oxygen diffusivity of the capillary network (D-C) and the partial pressure of oxygen at the mitochondria (PmO2). Significant between-group differences were observed as decreased CBF (p = 0.010), CMRO2 (p < 0.001) and D-C (p = 0.002), and increased PmO2 (p = 0.043) in patients compared to controls. No significant differences were observed for CBVdHb (p = 0.389), OEF (p = 0.358), or GM volume (p = 0.302). Regional analysis showed widespread reductions in CMRO2 and D-C for PwMS. Our findings may be indicative of reduced oxygen demand or utilisation in the MS brain and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest changes in brain physiology may precede MRI-detectable GM loss and may contribute to disease progression and neurodegeneration.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Gliomas propagate diffusely throughout and along white matter structures. Glioma-related changes in structural integrity and metabolism are not detectable by standard magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in the metabolism of fiber tract alterations between gliomas grade II to IV by correlation of fiber density values with metabolite concentrations measured by fiber density mapping and MR spectroscopic imaging.; METHODS: Fiber density mapping and MR spectroscopic imaging were performed in 48 patients with gliomas WHO grade II to IV. Fiber density mapping data were used to define fiber tracts in tumoral and peritumoral areas. Structural integrity of fiber tracts was assessed as fiber density ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratio (FD ICR). Metabolite concentrations for choline-containing compounds and N-acetyl-aspartate were computed and correlated to FD ICR values after coregistration with anatomic MR imaging.; RESULTS: In tumoral areas, choline-containing compound concentrations of altered fiber tracts were significantly different between low-and high-grade glioma and showed different courses for the correlations of FD ICR and choline-containing czeompounds. In high-grade glioma, increasing fiber destruction was associated with a massive progression in cell membrane proliferation. Peritumoral fiber structures showed significantly decreased N-acetyl-aspartate concentrations for all patients, but only patients with glioblastoma multiforme had significantly decreased fiber density compared with the contralateral side. Glioma grades II and III had significantly higher peritumoral FD ICR than glioblastoma multiforme.; CONCLUSION: A multiparametric MR imaging strategy providing information about both structural integrity and metabolism of the tumor is required for detailed assessment of glioma-related fiber tract alterations, which in turn is essential for treatment planning.

N2  -  PurposeThe purpose of this study is to develop double diffusion encoding (DDE) MRI methods for clinical use. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy measurements from DDE promise greater specificity to changes in tissue microstructure compared with conventional diffusion tensor imaging, but implementation of DDE sequences on whole-body MRI scanners is challenging because of the limited gradient strengths and lengthy acquisition times.
MethodsA custom single-refocused DDE sequence was implemented on a 3T whole-body scanner. The DDE gradient orientation scheme and sequence parameters were optimized based on a Gaussian diffusion assumption. Using an optimized 5-min DDE acquisition, microscopic fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were acquired for the first time in multiple sclerosis patients.; ResultsBased on simulations and in vivo human measurements, six parallel and six orthogonal diffusion gradient pairs were found to be the minimum number of diffusion gradient pairs necessary to produce a rotationally invariant measurement of FA. Simulations showed that optimal precision and accuracy of FA measurements were obtained using b-values between 1500 and 3000 smm(2). The FA maps showed improved delineation of multiple sclerosis lesions compared with conventional fractional anisotropy and distinct contrast from T-2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T-1-weighted imaging.; ConclusionThe FA maps can be measured using DDE in a clinical setting and may provide new opportunities for characterizing multiple sclerosis lesions and other types of tissue degeneration.

N2  -  Purpose: The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2006, 212,920 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and that 40,970 women will die from the disease. The development of more efficacious chemotherapies has improved outcomes, but the rapid assessment of clinical benefit from these agents remains challenging. In breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treatment response is traditionally assessed by physical examination and volumetric-based measurements, which are subjective and require macroscopic changes in tumor morphology. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a reliable and quantitative measure for the early assessment of response in a breast cancer model.
Experimental Design: Mice implanted with human breast cancer (MX-1) were treated with cyclophosphamide and evaluated using diffusion MRI and growth kinetics. Histologic analyses using terminal nucleoticlyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and H&E were done on tumor samples for correlation with imaging results.; Results: Cyclophosphamide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volumes compared with controls. The mean apparent diffusion change for treated tumors at days 4 and 7 posttreatment was 44 +- 5% and 94 +- 7%, respectively, which was statistically greater (P < 0.05) than the control tumors at the same time intervals. The median time-to-progression for control and treated groups was 11 and 32 days, respectively (P < 0.05).; Conclusion: Diffusion MRI was shown to detect early changes in the tumor microenvironment, which correlated with standard measures of tumor response as well as overall outcome. Moreover, these findings show the feasibility of using diffusion MRI for assessing treatment response of a breast tumor model in a neoadjuvant setting.

N2  -  Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in the brain and any other tissues. This article aimed to assess lesions in cerebello-thalamo-cortical network with an advanced technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in WD. 35 WD patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited to accept diffusion-weighted images with 15 gradient vectors and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The DTI parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusion (MD), were calculated by diffusion kurtosis estimator software. After registration, patient groups with FA mappings and MD mappings and normal groups were compared with 3dttest and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, corrected with FDR simulations (p = 0 001, a = 0 05, cluster size = 326). We found that the degree of FA increased in the bilateral head of the caudate nucleus (HCN), lenticular nucleus (LN), ventral thalamus, substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), right dentate nucleus (DN), and decreased in the mediodorsal thalamus and extensive white matter. The value of MD increased in HCN, LN, SN, RN, and extensive white matter. The technique of DTI provides higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional MRI to detect Wilson's disease. Besides, lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum might disconnect the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits or dentato-rubro-thalamic (DRT) track and disrupt cerebello-thalamo-cortical network finally, which may cause clinical extrapyramidal symptoms.

N2  -  Background: Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a rare variant of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), characterized by diffuse infiltration without the formation of a discrete mass. The diagnosis of LC is a challenge because the imaging findings are atypical for lymphoma. The purpose of present study is to investigate MRI characteristics and clinical features of LC and potentially facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis of this oftenmissed disease.
Methods: Seven patients (average 44 years, 19-58 years) with LC proved basing on MRI and histology were retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and cerebral MR imaging findings.; Results: The common presenting symptoms were cognitive decline, behavioral disturbance, gait disturbance. All patients had both deep and lobar lesion distribution, and two of them had infratentorial involvement. Lack of contrast enhancement and subtle patchy enhanced pattern were observed in two and three patients, respectively. The remaining two patients presented multiple patchy enhancement. Most of the lesions were slightly hyperintense to normal brain on DWI as well as hyperintense on ADC maps. Three patients presented a pattern of marked decrease of NAACr, increase of ChoCr, and two of the three cases showed increased LipCr and LacCr on MRS.; Conclusions: We conclude that diffuse bilateral lesions especially in deep and lobar region including white and gray matter, without enhancement or with patchy enhancement, marked decrease of NAACr and increase of ChoCr, and increased LipCr and LacCr are suggestive of LC. Prompt recognition of these imaging patterns may lead to early diagnosis of LC and brain biopsy with improved prognosis.

N2  -  Pixel-by-pixel spatiotemporal progression of focal ischemia (permanent occlusion) in rats was investigated using quantitative perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging every 30 minutes for 3 hours. The normal left-hemisphere apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was 0.7 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and CBF was 0.7 +/- 0.3 mL . g(-1) . min(-1) (mean +/- SD, n = 5). The ADC and CBF viability thresholds yielding the lesion volumes (LV) at 3 hours that best approximated the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) infarct volumes (200 +/- 30 mm(3)) at 24 hours were 0.53 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (30% +/- 2% reduction) and 0.30 +/- 0.09 mL . g(-1) . min(-1) (57% +/- 11% reduction), respectively. Temporal evolution of the ADC- and CBF-defined LV showed a significant "perfusion-diffusion mismatch" up to 2 hours (P < 0.05, n = 11), a potential therapeutic window. Based on the viability thresholds, three pixel clusters were identified on the CBF-ADC scatterplots: (1) a "normal" cluster with normal CBF and ADC, (2) an "ischemic core" cluster with markedly reduced CBF and ADC, and (3) a "mismatch" cluster with reduced CBF but slightly reduced ADC. These clusters were color-coded and mapped onto the image and CBF-ADC spaces. Lesions grew peripheral and medial to the initial ADC abnormality. In contrast to the CBF distribution, the ADC distribution in the ischemic hemisphere was bimodal; the relatively time-invariant bimodal-ADC minima were 0.57 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (corresponding CBF 0.35 +/- 0.04 mL . g(-1) . min(-1)), surprisingly similar to the TTC-derived thresholds. Together, these results illustrate an analysis approach to systemically track the pixel-by-pixel spatiotemporal progression of acute ischemic brain injury.

N2  -  Background: Selective improvement of symptoms may be required when treating Parkinson disease (PD) patients with a predominantly monosymptomatic clinical picture. Objective: To define a target in prelemniscal radiation fibers (Raprl) related to the physiopathology of tremor evidenced by tractography. Case Report: We report a patient with predominant unilateral rest and postural tremor, diagnosed as PD based on 80% improvement induced by the administration of L-DOPA/carbidopa, subsequently complicated by motor fluctuations, L-DOPA dyskinesia, and a reduced ON period. A stereotactic radiofrequency lesion was made for tremor control, and postoperative diffusion- weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated the precise location and extension of the lesioned tract. Results: Perfect control of the tremor was achieved with the patient OFF medication; this has lasted for 5 years, without hypotonia in the treated extremities. DWI revealed a 3.0-mm lesion at the base of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim) interrupting cerebellar-Vim fibers sparing the cerebellar ventralis oralis posterior nucleus component. Conclusion: Selective improvement of symptoms is feasible in patients with a predominantly monosymptomatic PD clinical presentation. (c) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  -  Objectives The development of integrated magnetic resonance (MR)-positron emission tomography (PET) hybrid imaging opens up new horizons for imaging in neuro-oncology. In cerebral gliomas the definition of tumour extent may be difficult to ascertain using standard MR imaging (MRI) only. The differentiation of post-therapeutic scar tissue, tumour rests and tumour recurrence is challenging. The relationship to structures such as the pyramidal tract to the tumour mass influences the therapeutic neurosurgical approach.
Methods The diagnostic information may be enriched by sophisticated MR techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), multiple-volume proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and functional MRI (fMRI). Metabolic imaging with PET, especially using amino acid tracers such as F-18-fluoroethyl-l-tyrosine (FET) or C-11-l-methionine (MET) will indicate tumour extent and response to treatment.; Results The new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing comprehensive answers by a one-stop-job of 40-50 min. The combined approach provides data of different modalities using the same iso-centre, resulting in optimal spatial and temporal realignment. All images are acquired exactly under the same physiological conditions.; Conclusions We describe the imaging protocol in detail and provide patient examples for the different imaging modalities such as FET-PET, standard structural imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-weighted contrast agent enhanced), DTI, MRSI and fMRI.; Key Points; .Hybrid MR-PET opens up new horizons in neuroimaging; .Hybrid MR-PET allows brain tumour assessment in one stop; .Hybrid MR-PET allows simultaneous acquisition of structural, functional and molecular images.

N2  -  The parametric response map (PRM) was evaluated as an early surrogate biomarker for monitoring treatment-induced tissue alterations in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was performed on 15 patients with HNSCC at baseline and 3 weeks after treatment initiation of a nonsurgical organ preservation therapy (NSOPT) using concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. PRM was applied on serial apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps that were spatially aligned using a deformable image registration algorithm to measure the tumor volume exhibiting significant changes in ADC (PRMADC). Pretherapy and midtherapy ADC maps, quantified from the DWIs, were analyzed by monitoring the percent change in whole-tumor mean ADC and the PRM metric. The prognostic values of percentage change in tumor volume and mean ADC and PRMADC as a treatment response biomarker were assessed by correlating with tumor control at 6 months. Pixel-wise differences as part of PRMADC analysis revealed regions where water mobility increased. Analysis of the tumor ADC histograms also showed increases in mean ADC as early as 3 weeks into therapy in patients with a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, the percentage change in mean ADC was found to not correlate with tumor control at 6 months. In contrast, significant differences in PRMADC and percentage change in tumor volume were observed between patients with pathologically different outcomes. Observations from this study have found that diffusion MRI, when assessed by PRMADC, has the potential to provide both prognostic and spatial information during NSOPT of head and neck cancer.

N2  -  To evaluate whether readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (RS-EPI) diffusion weighted image (DWI) can diminish image distortion in the head and neck area, compared with single-shot (SS)-EPI DWI.
We conducted phantom and patient studies using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 16-channel coil. For the phantom study, we evaluated distortion and signal homogeneity in gel phantoms. For the patient study, 29 consecutive patients with clinically suspicious parotid lesions were prospectively enrolled. RS-EPI and SS-EPI DWI were evaluated by two independent readers for identification of organlesion and distortion, using semiquantitative scales and quantitative scores. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and contrast-noise ratios of parotid tumours (if present; n = 15) were also compared.; The phantom experiments showed that RS-EPI provided less distorted and more homogeneous ADC maps than SS-EPI. In the patient study, RS-EPI was found to provide significantly less distortion in almost all organslesions (p < 0.05), according to both semiquantitative scales and quantitative scores. There was no significant difference in ADC values and contrast-noise ratios between the two DWI techniques.; The distortion in DWI was significantly reduced with RS-EPI in both phantom and patient studies. The RS-EPI technique provided more homogenous images than SS-EPI, and can potentially offer higher image quality in the head and neck area.; aEuro cent The distortion in DWI is significantly reduced with RS-EPI compared with SS-EPI.; aEuro cent Structures in the head and neck were identified more clearly using RS-EPI.; aEuro cent No significant difference in ADC values was found between the techniques.

N2  -  With the increasing size of datasets used in medical imaging research, the need for automated data curation is arising. One important data curation task is the structured organization of a dataset for preserving integrity and ensuring reusability. Therefore, we investigated whether this data organization step can be automated. To this end, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically recognizes eight different brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan types based on visual appearance. Thus, our method is unaffected by inconsistent or missing scan metadata. It can recognize pre-contrast T1-weighted (T1w),post-contrast T1-weighted (T1wC), T2-weighted (T2w), proton density-weighted (PDw) and derived maps (e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient and cerebral blood flow). In a first experiment,we used scans of subjects with brain tumors: 11065 scans of 719 subjects for training, and 2369 scans of 192 subjects for testing. The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 98.7%. In a second experiment, we trained the CNN on all 13434 scans from the first experiment and tested it on 7227 scans of 1318 Alzheimer's subjects. Here, the CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 98.5%. In conclusion, our method can accurately predict scan type, and can quickly and automatically sort a brain MRI dataset virtually without the need for manual verification. In this way, our method can assist with properly organizing a dataset, which maximizes the shareability and integrity of the data.

N2  -  Purpose Both laboratory markers and radiographic findings in the setting of spinal infections can be nonspecific in determining the presence or absence of active infection, and can lag behind both clinical symptoms and antibiotic response. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be helpful in evaluating brain abscesses but has not been commonly used in evaluating spinal infections. We aimed to correlate findings on DWI of the spine to results of microbiological sampling in patients with suspected spinal infections. Methods Patients who underwent MRI with DWI for suspicion of spinal infections and microbiological sampling from 2002 to 2010 were identified and reviewed retrospectively in this institutional review board approved study. In addition to DWI, scans included sagittal and axial T1, fast-spin echo (FSE) T2, and post-gadolinium T1 with fat saturation. Regions of interest were drawn on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in the area of suspected infections, and ADC values were correlated with microbiological sampling. Results Of 38 patients with suspected spinal infections, 29 (76%) had positive microbiological sampling, and 9 (24%) had negative results. The median ADC value was 740 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s for patients with positive microbiological sampling and 1980 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s for patients with negative microbiological sampling (p < 0.001). Using an ADC value of 1250 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s or less as the cut-off value for a positive result for spinal infection, sensitivity was 66%, specificity was 88%, positive predictive value was 95%, negative predictive value was 41% and accuracy was 70%. Conclusion In patients with suspected spine infection, ADC values on DWI are significantly reduced in those patients with positive microbiological sampling compared to patients with negative microbiological sampling. The DWI of the spine correlates well with the presence or absence of spinal infection and may complement conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

T2  -  PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS

N2  -  Extensive growth in functional brain imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, brain mapping and brain scanning techniques has led tremendously to the importance of cerebral cortical segmentation both in 2-D and 3-D from volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging data sets. Besides that, recent growth in deformable brain segmentation techniques in 2-D and 3-D has brought the engineering community, such as the areas of computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition and graphics, closer to the medical community, such as to neuro-surgeons, psychiatrists, oncologists, neuro-radiologists and internists. In Part I of this research (see Suri et al [1]), an attempt was made to review the state-of-the-art in 2-D and 3-D cerebral cortical segmentation techniques from brain magnetic resonance imaging based on two main classes: region- and boundary/surface-based. More than 18 different techniques for segmenting the cerebral cortex from brain slices acquired in orthogonal directions were shown using region-based techniques. We also showed more than ten different techniques to segment the cerebral cortex from magnetic resonance brain volumes using boundary/surface-based techniques. This paper (Part II) focuses on presenting state-of-the-art systems based on the fusion of boundary/surface-based with region-based techniques, also called regional-geometric deformation models, which takes the paradigm of partial differential equations in the level set framework. We also discuss the pros and cons of these various techniques, besides giving the mathematical foundations for each sub-class in the cortical taxonomy. Special emphasis is placed on discussing the advantages, validation, challenges and neuro-science/clinical applications of cortical segmentation.

T2  -  CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY

N2  -  Purpose of review
Imaging the penumbra is essential, not only to identify patients who might benefit from thrombolysis, but also to further understanding of the ischaemic process, thereby potentially revealing new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here we review recent imaging studies of the acute stroke process.; Recent findings; Perfusion-computed tomography and computed tomography angiography enable assessment of the haemodynamic status and site of occlusion, leading to their promising use in guiding thrombolysis. The magnetic resonance concept of the diffusion-perfusion 'mismatch' being representative of penumbra appears to be an oversimplification. The mapping of simple variables such as time-to-peak might not directly reveal true penumbra perfusion levels. Also, lesions seen with diffusion-weighted imaging may be reversible as a result of early reperfusion. This reversal with subsequent normalization may represent selective neuronal damage. Late secondary injury, as indicated by the reappearance of the diffusion-weighted imaging lesion, has recently been documented; the mechanisms are unknown but form potential targets for future therapies. Despite these caveats, diffusion-weighted imaging-perfusion-weighted imaging remains the most useful approach to map the pathophysiology of stroke in the clinical setting. Acutesubacute flumazenil positron emission tomography studies are being used as markers of neuronal integrity to help shed further light on infarction thresholds, and potentially document selective neuronal loss. F-18-labelled fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography imaging of brain hypoxia documents the temporal and spatial progression of the penumbra.; Summary; The goal of understanding the complex process that is acute ischaemia in stroke, and subsequently the development of therapeutic strategies, continues to be advanced by imaging the penumbra in novel ways.

T2  -  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY

N2  -  Background: Metastatic complications are a major cause of cancer-related morbidity, with up to 40% of cancer patients experiencing at least one brain metastasis. Earlier detection may significantly improve patient outcomes and overall survival. We investigated machine learning (ML) models for early detection of brain metastases based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) radiomics.Methods: Longitudinal diffusion imaging from 116 patients previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical contours from 600 metastases were extracted from radiosurgery planning computed tomography, and rigidly registered to corresponding contrast enhanced-T1 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Contralateral contours located in healthy brain tissue were used as control. The dataset consisted of (I) radiomic features using ADC maps, (II) radiomic feature change calculated using timepoints before the metastasis manifested on contrast enhanced-T1, (III) primary cancer, and (IV) anatomical location. The dataset was divided into training and internal validation sets using an 80/20 split with stratification. Four classification algorithms [Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, and XGBoost] underwent supervised classification training, with contours labeled either 'control' or 'metastasis'. Hyperparameters were optimized towards balanced accuracy. Various model metrics (receiver operating characteristic curve area scores, accuracy, recall, and precision) were calculated to gauge performance.Results: The radiomic and clinical data set, feature engineering, and ML models developed were able to identify metastases with an accuracy of up to 87.7% on the training set, and 85.8% on an unseen test set. XGBoost and RF showed superior accuracy (XGBoost: 0.877 & PLUSMN;0.021 and 0.833 & PLUSMN;0.47, RF: 0.823 & PLUSMN;0.024 and 0.858 & PLUSMN;0.045) for training and validation sets, respectively. XGBoost and RF also showed strong area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) performance on the validation set (0.910 & PLUSMN;0.037 and 0.922 & PLUSMN;0.034, respectively). AdaBoost performed slightly lower in all metrics. SVM model generalized poorly with the internal validation set. Important features involved changes in radiomics months before manifesting on contrast enhanced-T1.Conclusions: The proposed models using diffusion-based radiomics showed encouraging results in differentiating healthy brain tissue from metastases using clinical imaging data. These findings suggest that longitudinal diffusion imaging and ML may help improve patient care through earlier diagnosis and increased patient monitoring/follow-up. Future work aims to improve model classification metrics, robustness, user-interface, and clinical applicability.

N2  -  Background: Japanese encephalitis is a flavivirus that can cause pandemic encephalitis, and is prevalent in Southeast Asia and Australia. Brain images of patients with Japanese encephalitis are characterized by thalamic lesions, distinct from those seen in viral encephalopathies caused by the herpes simplex virus and West Nile virus.
Aim: Herein, we describe for the first time a time-dependent magnetic resonance imaging pattern in Japanese encephalitis in a 10 month-old Japanese boy.; Case: The patient was a previously healthy 10-month-old Japanese boy, who exhibited acute-onset flaccid tetraplegia and loss of tendon reflexes.; Results: Brain MRI showed characteristic thalamic changes on diffusion weighted images from spotty to uniform and from the left to the right side, associated with low apparent diffusion coefficient maps. These images suggest that the Japanese encephalitis virus may first affect the unilateral thalamus, possibly expanding to the other side, with characteristic patterns changing from spotty to uniform in a manner consistent with the presentation of cytotoxic edema.; Conclusion: This report first showed longitudinal magnetic resonance changes in Japanese encephalitis, which may help in accurate diagnosis and in discrimination from other etiologies.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides preoperative maps of neurosurgical patients' white matter tracts, but these maps suffer from echo-planar imaging (EPI) distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities. In clinical neurosurgical planning, these distortions are generally not corrected and thus contribute to the uncertainty of fiber tracking. Multiple image processing pipelines have been proposed for image-registration-based EPI distortion correction in healthy subjects. In this article, we perform the first comparison of such pipelines in neurosurgical patient data.
METHODS: Five pipelines were tested in a retrospective clinical dMRI dataset of 9 patients with brain tumors. Pipelines differed in the choice of fixed and moving images and the similarity metric for image registration. Distortions were measured in two important tracts for neurosurgery, the arcuate fasciculus and corticospinal tracts.; RESULTS: Significant differences in distortion estimates were found across processing pipelines. The most successful pipeline used dMRI baseline and T2-weighted images as inputs for distortion correction. This pipeline gave the most consistent distortion estimates across image resolutions and brain hemispheres.; CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative results of mean tract distortions on the order of 1-2 mm are in line with other recent studies, supporting the potential need for distortion correction in neurosurgical planning. Novel results include significantly higher distortion estimates in the tumor hemisphere and greater effect of image resolution choice on results in the tumor hemisphere. Overall, this study demonstrates possible pitfalls and indicates that care should be taken when implementing EPI distortion correction in clinical settings.

N2  -  Ambiguous imaging appearance of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and solitary Metastasis (MET) is a challenge to conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based diagnosis, leading to exploitation of advanced MRI techniques, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). In this study, 3D tumor models are generated by a DTI clustering segmentation technique, providing up to 16 brain tissue diffusivities, complemented by T1 post-contrast imaging, resulting in the identification of tumor core, whose surface is refined by a Morphological Morphing interpolation technique. The 3D models are analyzed in terms of their surface and internal signal variations characteristics towards identification of discriminant features for differentiation between GBMs and METs, utilizing a case sample composed of 10 GBMs and 10 METs. Morphology analysis of tumor core surface is assessed by 5 local curvature features. Texture analysis considers 11 first and 16 second order 3D textural features. From the 16 second order features, 11 are based on Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrices (GLCM) and 5 on Gray Level Run Length Matrices (GLRLM), calculated from DTI isotropic and anisotropic parametric maps, corresponding to 3D tumor core segmented from the clustering technique. Also, 3 different image quantization levels (QL) were tested for both GLCM and GLRLM analysis, while 1-4 pixel displacements (D) in case of GLCM analysis. Case sample distributions of morphology and texture features were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, with a cut-off value of 0.05 to identify discriminant features. The discriminatory performance of the derived features was analyzed with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results highlight the value of all 5 local curvature descriptors to capture differences between the boundary of GBMs and METs. Histogram analysis of isotropy maps revealed statistical significant differences for median value and kurtosis, while 7 out of the 11 GLCM features were capable of discriminating heterogeneity of anisotropic diffusion properties of GBMs and METs, at QL = 6 and D = 2. Finally, all 5 GLRLM features extracted from diffusion isotropy maps seem to discriminate structural properties of GBMs and METs, at QL = 5. Results demonstrate the potential of surface morphology and texture analysis of 3D tumor imaging appearance in pre-treatment brain MRI tumor differentiation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Significance: Imaging Mueller polarimetry is capable to trace in-plane orientation of brain fiber tracts by detecting the optical anisotropy of white matter of healthy brain. Brain tumor cells grow chaotically and destroy this anisotropy. Hence, the drop in scalar retardance values and randomization of the azimuth of the optical axis could serve as the optical marker for brain tumor zone delineation.Aim: The presence of underlying crossing fibers can also affect the values of scalar retardance and the azimuth of the optical axis. We studied and analyzed the impact of fiber crossing on the polarimetric images of thin histological sections of brain corpus callosum.Approach: We used the transmission Mueller microscope for imaging of two-layered stacks of thin sections of corpus callosum tissue to mimic the overlapping brain fiber tracts with different fiber orientations. The decomposition of the measured Mueller matrices was performed with differential and Lu-Chipman algorithms and completed by the statistical analysis of the maps of scalar retardance, azimuth of the optical axis, and depolarization.Results: Our results indicate the sensitivity of Mueller polarimetry to different spatial arrangement of brain fiber tracts as seen in the maps of scalar retardance and azimuth of optical axis of two-layered stacks of corpus callosum sections The depolarization varies slightly (<15 % ) with the orientation of the optical axes in both corpus callosum stripes, but its value increases by 2.5 to 3 times with the stack thickness.Conclusions: The crossing brain fiber tracts measured in transmission induce the drop in values of scalar retardance and randomization of the azimuth of the optical axis at optical path length of 15 mu m. It suggests that the presence of nerve fibers crossing within the depth of few microns will be also detected in polarimetric maps of brain white matter measured in reflection configuration.

N2  -  Early loss of white matter microstructure integrity is a significant cause of long-term neurological disorders following traumatic brain injury (TBI). White matter abnormalities typically involve axonal loss and demyelination. In-vivo imaging tools to detect and differentiate such microstructural changes are not well-explored. This work utilizes the conjoint potential offered by advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques, including quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to discern the underlying white matter pathology at specific time points (5 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days) post-injury in the controlled cortical impact mouse model. A total of 42 animals were randomized into six TBI groups (n = 6 per group) and one sham group (n = 6). Histopathology was performed to validate in-vivo findings by performing myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining for the assessment of changes to myelin and astrocytes. After 5 h of injury radial diffusivity (RD) was increased in white matter without a significant change in axial diffusivity (AxD) and susceptibility values. After 1 day post-injury RD was decreased. AxD and susceptibility changes were seen after 3 days post-injury. Susceptibility increases in white matter were observed in both ipsilateral and contralateral regions and persisted for 30 days. In histology, an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity was observed after 3 days post-injury and remained high for 30 days in both ipsilateral and contralateral white matter regions. A loss in MBP signal was noted after 3 days post-injury that continued up to 30 days. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the complementary ability of DTI and QSM in discerning the micro-pathological processes triggered following TBI. While DTI revealed acute and focal white matter changes, QSM mirrored the temporal demyelination in the white matter tracts and diffuse regions at the chronic state.

N2  -  Background & Aims: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is now thought to be caused by cerebral oedema although the precise pathogenesis is uncertain. We hypothesised that if ammonia is a key factor, induced hyperammonaemia would lead to transient changes in brain water distribution and metabolite concentration, detectable by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
Methods: Thirteen cirrhotic patients being evaluated for liver transplantation were challenged with 54 g of equal parts of threonine, serine, and glycine. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to exclude structural lesions and localise regions of interest. DTI was used to generate white matter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and proton MRS to measure brain metabolite concentrations before and after the challenge.; Results: The challenge caused a mean (+- SD) rise in blood ammonia of 58 (+- 41) mu molL, which was accompanied by a significant 9% increase in ADC (p = 0.004). Increased ADC significantly correlated with blood ammonia (r = 0.58, p = 0.04). The change in ammonia levels also correlated with the increase in glutamine levels (r = 0.78, p = 0.002). Myo-inositol concentration decreased significantly by 0.7 (+- 0.7) mMolL between scans and this correlated with the mean difference in ADC (r = 0.59, p < 0.04).; Conclusions: These results show that ammonia can directly drive changes in brain water distribution as a mechanism for cerebral oedema development. Since cerebral astrocytes contain glutamine synthetase, our MRS data suggest intracerebral formation of glutamine from ammonia. The rapid decrease in myo-inositol indicates that this organic osmolyte plays a protective role in HE by release from astrocytes in order to maintain cell volume.

N2  -  Objective: Intracranial epidermoids (cholesteatomas) mimic arachnoid cysts in their radiologic characteristics, especially in the cerebellopontine angle. It is essential to differentiate the two conditions because they warrant different therapeutic interventions. The objective of this study is to elucidate the different radiologic characteristics of the conditions.
Study Design and Setting: This was a retrospective study of 4 patients referred for a differential diagnosis and management of intracranial cystic lesions to the Departments of NeurotologyNeurosurgery and Neuroradiology in a tertiary referral university hospital.; Patients: Four patients of different age groups with cystic intracranial lesions, diagnosed epidermoid or arachnoid cysts, were chosen. A retrospective analysis of their case charts. radiologic and surgical interventions. and follow-up records was undertaken.; Methods: The imaging techniques used included computerized tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1, T2, proton-density, and gadolinium-enhanced T1 images. In addition, special MRI sequences were used that included fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and echo planar diffusion scanning. All the patients underwent an audiovestibular evaluation.; Results: Both lesions are characteristically well demarcated and have a homogeneous low density, similar to cerebrospinal fluid on computerized tomographic scan, showing no contrast enhancement. On MRI. epidermoids and arachnoid cysts usually appear hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. On fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, an arachnoid cyst tends to follow cerebrospinal fluid intensity, whereas an epidermoid becomes hyperintense. There are occasions when an epidermoid may appear as a low-intensity lesion on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. This dilemma is resolved with the use of echo planar diffusion scanning, on which an epidermoid remains bright.; Conclusion: The authors recommend the use of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion sequence MRI when definitive radiologic diagnosis of cystic intracranial lesions becomes difficult with routine computerized tomographic scanning and MRI.

N2  -  Thermal therapy of tumour including hyperthermia and thermal ablation by heat or cold delivery requires on line monitoring. Due to its temperature sensitivity, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows thermal mapping at the time of the treatment. The different techniques of MR temperature monitoring based on water proton resonance frequency (PRF), longitudinal relaxation time T1, diffusion coefficient and MR Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) are reviewed and debated. The PRF method appears the most widely used and the most efficient at high magnetic field in spite of important drawbacks. The T1 method is the easiest method of visualisation of qualitative temperature distribution and quantitative measurement seems possible in the tissue surrounding the tumour up to a temperature of 45-65 degreesC. Despite its high temperature sensitivity, application of the diffusion method in vivo is restricted due to its high motion sensitivity. The recent MRSI technique seems very promising provided acquisition times can be reduced. Results from the literature indicate that MR temperature monitoring in vivo can be achieved in vivo with a precision of about 3 degreesC in 13 s for a voxel of 16 mm(3) (1.5 x 1.5 x 7 mm) in 1.5 T scanners.

N2  -  With the rise of aging population, clinical concern and research attention has shifted towards neuroimaging of dementia. The advent of 3T, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has permitted the anatomical imaging of neurodegenerative disease, specifically dementia, with improved resolution. Furthermore, more powerful techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative susceptibility mapping, and magnetic transfer imaging have successfully emerged for the detection of micro-structural abnormalities. In the present review article, we provide a brief overview of Alzheimer's disease and explore recent neuroimaging developments in the field of dementia with an emphasis on structural MR imaging in order to propose a simple and easily applicable systematic approach to the imaging diagnosis of dementia.

N2  -  Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the management of preexisting hypertension is still controversial in the treatment of acute stroke in hypertensive patients. The present study evaluates the influence of preserving hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia on stroke outcome in a rat model of chronic hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient (1 h) occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, during which mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at normotension (110-120 mm Hg, group 1, n=6) or hypertension (160-170 mm Hg, group 2, n=6) using phenylephrine. T2-, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI were performed serially at five different time points: before and during ischemia, and at 1, 4 and 7 days after ischemia. Lesion volume and brain edema were estimated from apparent diffusion coefficient maps and T2-weighted images. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured within and outside the perfusion deficient lesion and in the corresponding regions of the contralesional hemisphere. Neurological deficits were evaluated after reperfusion. Infarct volume, edema, and neurological deficits were significantly reduced in group 2 vs. group 1. In addition, higher values and rapid restoration of rCBF were observed in group 2, while rCBF in both hemispheres was significantly decreased in group 1. Maintaining preexisting hypertension alleviates ischemic brain injury in SHR by increasing collateral circulation to the ischemic region and allowing rapid restoration of rCBF. The data suggest that maintaining preexisting hypertension is a valuable approach to managing hypertensive patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  A 47-year-old man with Bechet's disease presented with a five day history of right side weakness and dysarthria. Ten years ago, he was diagnosed as Behcet's disease. Since then, he was treated with low dose steroids. T1- Weighted magnetic resonance images with gadolinium injection revealed ring enhancing lesions with internal hypointensities at the left side of the pons and at the left parietal cortex suggesting multiple metastatic tumors. Diffusion-weighted image and ADC map revealed central hyperintensity on diffusion with low ADC values at both lesions. The histopathology of stereotactic biopsy specimen showed frequent perivascular lymphocytic cuffings, focal necrotic lesions and reactive gliosis. The most common neuropathologic findings in neuro-Behcet's disease are focal necrotic lesions, but the location in cerebral cortex has not been reported before. Long term steroid therapy and antibiotics were administered and the patient recovered gradually. Neuro-Behcet's disease could be presented as brain tumor like lesion, and stereotactic biopsy should be considered in such situation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  In patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), we investigated whether brain and cervical cord structural changes in lesions and normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT), measured using conventional, magnetization transfer (MT), and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI, are correlated with movement-associated cortical activations measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). From 26 right-handed PPMS patients and 15 right-handed, sex- and age-matched healthy controls, we obtained: (a) brain and cervical cord dual-echo scans and MT ratio (MTR) maps; (b) brain mean diffusivity (D) maps, and (c) f-MRI (flexion-extension of the last four fingers of the right hand). All PPMS patients had no previous symptoms affecting their right upper limbs, which were functionally normal. Healthy volunteers showed more significant activation in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere than PPMS patients. PPMS patients showed greater activation bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus, ipsilaterally in the middle frontal gyrus, and, contralaterally in the insula/claustrum. In PPMS patients, moderate to strong correlations (r values ranging from 0.59 to 0.68) were found between relative activations of cortical areas located in a widespread network for sensory-motor and multimodal integration and the severity of structural changes of the NABT (as measured using MT and DT MRI) and the severity of cervical cord damage (as measured using MT MRI). This study shows that the pattern of cortical activation of PPMS patients is different from that of normal controls even when performing a motor task with clinically unaffected limbs. It also suggests that cortical reorganization might be able to limit the consequences of MS injury in the brain and cervical cord. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  -  Background: This study aims to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns of structural brain injury related to deep medullary veins (DMVs) damage. Methods and Results: This is a longitudinal analysis of the population-based Shunyi cohort study. Baseline DMVs numbers were identified on susceptibility-weighted imaging. We assessed vertex-wise cortex maps and diffusion maps at both baseline and follow-up using FSL software and the longitudinal FreeSurfer analysis suite. We performed statistical analysis of global measurements and voxel/vertex-wise analysis to explore the relationship between DMVs number and brain structural measurements. A total of 977 participants were included in the baseline, of whom 544 completed the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (age 54.97 +/- 7.83 years, 32% men, mean interval 5.56 +/- 0.47 years). A lower number of DMVs was associated with a faster disruption of white matter microstructural integrity, presented by increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusion (beta=0.0001 and SE=0.0001 for both, P=0.04 and 0.03, respectively), in extensive deep white matter (threshold-free cluster enhancement P<0.05, adjusted for age and sex). Of particular interest, we found a bidirectional trend association between DMVs number and change in brain volumes. Specifically, participants with mild DMVs disruption showed greater cortical enlargement, whereas those with severe disruption exhibited more significant brain atrophy, primarily involving clusters in the frontal and parietal lobes (multiple comparison corrected P<0.05, adjusted for age, sex, and total intracranial volume). Conclusions: Our findings posed the dynamic pattern of brain parenchymal lesions related to DMVs injury, shedding light on the interactions and chronological roles of various pathological mechanisms.

N2  -  This article provides a review of brain tissue alterations that may be detectable using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging MRI (dMRI) approaches and an overview and perspective on the modern dMRI toolkits for characterizing alterations that follow traumatic brain injury (TBI). Noninvasive imaging is a cornerstone of clinical treatment of TBI and has become increasingly used for preclinical and basic research studies. In particular, quantitative MRI methods have the potential to distinguish and evaluate the complex collection of neurobiological responses to TBI arising from pathology, neuroprotection, and recovery. dMRI provides unique information about the physical environment in tissue and can be used to probe physiological, architectural, and microstructural features. Although well-established approaches such as diffusion tensor imaging are known to be highly sensitive to changes in the tissue environment, more advanced dMRI techniques have been developed that may offer increased specificity or new information for describing abnormalities. These tools are promising, but incompletely understood in the context of TBI. Furthermore, model dependencies and relative limitations may impact the implementation of these approaches and the interpretation of abnormalities in their metrics. The objective of this paper is to present a basic review and comparison across dMRI methods as they pertain to the detection of the most commonly observed tissue and cellular alterations following TBI.

N2  -  Purpose: The authors analyzed the characteristics of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and C-11-methionine (MET) PET to compare the efficacies of these modalities in making the distinction between radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence of high-grade glioma.
Patients and methods: Ten patients were evaluated with dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI, C-11-MET PET and F-18-FDG PET to visualize gadolinium-enhanced lesions during the post-radiation follow-up period. In the perfusion MRI, four regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and average values were calculated. A reference ROI of the same size was defined in the contralateral white matter to obtain the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). After coregistering the PET images with the MRI, we measured the maximum uptake values of the lesion and of the contralateral cerebral white matter as reference area to calculate the L-maxR-max ratio.; Results: The rCBV was higher in the recurrence group than in the necrosis group (p = 0.010). There was no difference between groups in terms of the L-maxR-max ratio as derived from the 18F-FDG and C-11-MET PET.; Conclusion:A quantitative rCBV as calculated from a perfusion MRI scan might be superior to the L-maxR-max ratio as derived from F-18-FDG and C-11-MET PET in order to distinguish a recurrence of high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis.

N2  -  A 9-year-old, intact male Shih Tzu dog presented with systemic weakness and peracute onset of tetraplegia. Tetraplegia with lower motor neuron signs was noted upon neurological examination. Diseases that cause acute flaccid tetraparesis, such as acute fulminating myasthenia gravis, polyradiculoneuritis, tick paralysis, and botulism, were ruled out based on the medical history, normal electrophysiological tests, and non-response to the neostigmine challenging test. Initial 0.3-Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings included sharply demarcated intramedullary lesions at the C3-C6 level, mainly involving gray matter, which appeared hypo- to iso- intense on T1-weighted images (WIs), and hyperintense on T2-WIs and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. There was no enhancement on post-contrast T1-WIs. Neutrophilic pleocytosis was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. No clinical responses were observed for the treatment of non-infectious myelitis with an immunosuppressive dosage of prednisolone. A follow-up 3-T MRI 6 days later demonstrated hyperintensity on diffusion-WI (DWI) and a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (0.54 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) of the spinal lesions. Through histological examination, a fibrocartilaginous embolism was definitively confirmed. This is the first report to describe an ischemic spinal injury visualized by DWI and ADC mapping with high-field MRI in a chondrodystrophic dog diagnosed with a fibrocartilaginous embolism.

N2  -  Objectives: Accurate presurgical brain mapping enables preoperative risk assessment and intraoperative guidance. This cross-sectional study investigated whether constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) methods were more accurate than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods for presurgical white matter mapping using intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) as the ground truth. Methods: Five different tractography methods were compared (three DTI-based and two CSD-based) in 22 preoperative neurosurgical patients undergoing surgery with DES mapping. The corticospinal tract (CST, N = 20) and arcuate fasciculus (AF, N = 7) bundles were reconstructed, then minimum distances between tractograms and DES coordinates were compared between tractography methods. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for both bundles. For the CST, binary agreement, linear modeling, and posthoc testing were used to compare tractography methods while correcting for relative lesion and bundle volumes. Results: Distance measures between 154 positive (functional response, pDES) and negative (no response, nDES) coordinates, and 134 tractograms resulted in 860 data points. Higher agreement was found between pDES coordinates and CSD-based compared to DTI-based tractograms. ROC curves showed overall higher sensitivity at shorter distance cutoffs for CSD (8.5 mm) compared to DTI (14.5 mm). CSD-based CST tractograms showed significantly higher agreement with pDES, which was confirmed by linear modeling and posthoc tests (P-FWE < .05). Conclusions: CSD-based CST tractograms were more accurate than DTI-based ones when validated using DES-based assessment of motor and sensory function. This demonstrates the potential benefits of structural mapping using CSD in clinical practice.

N2  -  Purpose
Assessment of radiologic response (RR) for brain tumors utilizes the Macdonald criteria 8 to 10 weeks from the start of treatment. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a functional diffusion map (fDM) may provide an earlier measure to predict patient survival.; Patients and Methods; Sixty patients with high-grade glioma were enrolled onto a study of intratreatment MRI at 1, 3, and 10 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate imaging parameters as a function of patient survival at 1 year. Both log-rank and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to assess overall survival.; Results; Greater increases in diffusion in response to therapy over time were observed in those patients alive at 1 year compared with those who died as a result of disease. The volume of tumor with increased diffusion by fDM at 3 weeks was the strongest predictor of patient survival at 1 year, with larger fDM predicting longer median survival (52.6 v 10.9 months; log-rank, P <. 003; hazard ratio HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.9). Radiologic response at 10 weeks had similar prognostic value (median survival, 31.6 v 10.9 months; log-rank P < .0007; HR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2). Radiologic response and fDM differed in 25% of cases. A composite index of response including fDM and RR provided a robust predictor of patient survival and may identify patients in whom RR does not correlate with clinical outcome.; Conclusion; Compared with conventional neuroimaging, fDM provided an earlier assessment of equal predictive value, and the combination of fDM and RR provided a more accurate prediction of patient survival than either metric alone.

N2  -  Object. Early and aggressive resection of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) leads to increased overall patient survival, decreased malignant progression, and better seizure control. This case series describes the authors' approach to achieving optimal neurological and surgical outcomes in patients referred by outside neurosurgeons for stereotactic biopsy of tumors believed to be complex or a high surgical risk, due to their diffuse nature on neuroimaging and their obvious infiltration of functional cortex.
Methods. Seven patients underwent individualized neuroimaging evaluation preoperatively, which included routine brain MRI with and without contrast administration for intraoperative neuronavigation, functional MRI with speech and motor mapping, diffusion tensor imaging to delineate white matter tracts, and MR perfusion to identify potential foci of higher grade malignancy within the tumor. Awake craniotomy with intraoperative motor and speech mapping was performed in all patients. Tumor removal was initiated through a transsylvian approach for insular lesions, and through multiple corticotomies in stimulation-confirmed noneloquent areas for all other lesions. Resection was continued until neuronavigation indicated normal brain, cortical or subcortical stimulation revealed functional cortex, or the patient began to experience a minor neurological deficit on intraoperative testing.; Results. Gross-total resection was achieved in 1 patient and subtotal resection (> 80%) in 6 patients, as assessed by postoperative MRI. Over the average follow-up duration of 31 months, no patient experienced a progression or recurrence. Long-term seizure control was excellent in 6 patients who achieved Engel Class I outcomes. Neurologically, all 7 patients experienced mild temporary deficits or seizures that completely resolved, and 1 patient continues to have mild expressive aphasia.; Conclusions. Significant resection of diffuse, infiltrating LGGs is possible, even in presumed eloquent cortex. Aggressive resection maximizes seizure control and does not necessarily cause permanent neurological deficits. Individualized preoperative neuroimaging evaluation, including tractography and awake craniotomy with intraoperative speech and motor mapping, is an essential tool in achieving these outcomes.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in advanced magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative mapping, cases remain in which it is difficult to determine whether viable eloquent structures are involved by a glioma. A novel software program, deformable anatomic templates (DAT), rapidly embeds the normal location of eloquent cortex and functional tracts in the magnetic resonance images of glioma-bearing brain.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of the DAT technique in patients with gliomas related to eloquent brain.; METHODS: Forty cases of gliomas (grade II-IV) with minimal mass effect were referred for a prospective preoperative and postoperative DAT analysis. The DAT results were compared with the patient's functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, operative stimulation, and new postoperative clinical deficits.; RESULTS: Fifteen of the 40 glioma patients had overlap between tumor and eloquent structures. Immediate postoperative neurological deficits were seen in 9 cases in which the DAT showed the eloquent area both within the tumor and within or at the edge of the resection cavity. In 6 cases with no deficits, DAT placed the eloquent area in the tumor but outside the resection cavity.; CONCLUSION: This is proof of concept that DAT can improve the analysis of diffuse gliomas of any grade by efficiently alerting the surgeon to the possibility of eloquent area invasion. The technique is especially helpful in diffuse glioma because these tumors tend to infiltrate rather than displace eloquent structures. DAT is limited by tract displacement in gliomas that produces moderate to severe mass effect.

T2  -  INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT

N2  -  Objective: Surgery for lesions related to the eloquent motor cortex and the corticospinal tract is challenging. Intraoperative cortical and subcortical stimulation are reliable techniques for motor cortex and corticospinal tract (CST) mapping. Pre-operative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are able to provide helpful data for safe surgical planning with both cortical and subcortical lesion resection. The authors combine these imaging techniques with intraoperative stimulation to identify and pre-serve cortical and subcortical motor tissue. Methods: This is a prospective analysis of 56 patients between May 2020 and June 2021, who underwent lesion resection. Thirty-one patients underwent preoperative DTI, thirteen patients underwent preoperative fMRI and their data were used for a tractography-based neuronavigation system. All patients were operated under general anesthesia. Intraoperative mapping data were collected from operative protocol and neurophysiologist's notes. The assessment of paresis was done by an independent neurosurgeon and was carried out using the motor strength scale of 0-5 according to the Medical Research Council scale. All patients with new or worsened postoperative motor deficits were followed for 6 months. Results: None of the patients exhibited a seizure during the operation. There were eight cases that experienced immediate motor deficits after surgery. At six months after surgery, only two patients (3.6%) had permanent motor deficits (motor strength scale rating 3 in one case and 4 in the other). The average distance between the lesions and CSTs in the positive subcortical stimulation response group was 3.39 +/- 2.19 mm and 8.59 +/- 3.27 mm in the negative group. Using a 5 mA stimulation threshold value resulted in a sensitivity of 12.5% and a specificity of 92.7%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 84.4% and a positive predictive value of 25% for motor function. Conclusions: Intraoperative cortical and subcortical motor mapping in lesion resection resulted in a low ratio of permanent postoperative deficits. Subcortical alert threshold <= 5 mA is supposed to be a safe threshold in lesion resection with a high specificity of 92.7% and a negative predictive value of 84.4%.

N2  -  We measured serial changes in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW) and in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 1 to 3 hours after induction of acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) in rats, to assess the rate of development of cytotoxic edema and ischemic brain damage observed in this model. Cortical ADC values underneath the hematoma in ASDH rats (n = 12) were significantly lower than those in sham-operated rats (n = 5) at 1 hour. By 3 hours, the area of ADC abnormality had further increased. The lesion areas, as percentage of hemispheric areas on 1- and 3-hour ADC maps, correlated significantly with those on the histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, The results indicate that DWI with ADC mapping may provide a valuable diagnostic tool for monitoring of early pathologic changes following subdural hematoma in head-injured patients.

N2  -  Objectives: To investigate diffusional changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques and non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion by using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI).
Methods: 31 MS patients and 21 controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. Mean kurtosis (MK) parametric maps were computed. Region of interest (ROI) was delineated as white matter (WM) in controls and MS plaques and WM in patients.; Results: There was no significance of WM kurtosis and skewness parameters among MS group and control group patients p=0.213 and p=0.390, respectively. In MS patients, kurtosis, skewness, maximum intensity, minimum intensity, and median intensity values of WM, Plaque 1, Plaque 2, and Plague 3 were significantly higher at p<0.0001 for all.; Conclusions: DKI may provide more extensive characterization of lesions and WM and may be a sensitive indicator of tissue damage and microstructural change in patients with MS in addition to conventional diffusional evaluations.

N2  -  Posterior encephalopathy is characterised by headache, impairment of consciousness, seizures and progressive visual loss. MRI shows bilateral, predominantly posterior, cortical and subcortical lesions with a distribution. Our aim was to analyse the MRI lesion pattern and angiographic findings because the pathophysiology of posterior encephalopathy is incompletely understood. We report three patients with clinical and imaging findings consistent with posterior encephalopathy who underwent serial MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and construction of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and four-vessel digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DWI revealed symmetrical subcortical and cortical parieto-occipital high signal. High and also low ADCs indicated probable vasogenic and cytotoxic oedema. On follow-up there was focal cortical laminar necrosis, while the white-matter lesions resolved almost completely, except in the arterial border zones. DSA revealed diffuse arterial narrowing, slightly more marked in the posterior circulation. These findings suggest that posterior encephalopathy may in some cases be due to diffuse, severe vasospasm affecting especially in the parieto-occipital grey matter, with its higher vulnerability to ischemia. Cerebral vasospasm due to digitoxin intoxication, resulting in posterior encephalopathy, has not yet been described previously.

N2  -  Multiple ring-enhancing lesions of the brain are one of the most commonly encountered abnormalities on neuroimaging. These can be caused by a variety of infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory or vascular diseases. Distinguishing non-neoplastic causes from neoplastic lesions is extremely important because a misdiagnosis can lead to unwarranted neurosurgery and exposure to toxic chemotherapy or potentially harmful brain irradiation. Diligent clinical evaluation and a battery of tests are required for making a definitive diagnosis. Newer advanced diagnostic techniques, such as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), perfusion-weighted MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, single-photon emission tomography and positron emission tomography may help in establishing the etiology. However, early brain biopsy is often needed because several of these diseases are potentially life-threatening.

N2  -  An inherent drawback of the traditional diffusion tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed information about multidirectional fiber architecture within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber tractography results in locations where fiber bundles cross each other. This may lead to the inability to visualize clinically important tracts such as the lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this report, we present a deterministic two-tensor extended Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers. We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human brain data, comparing the results with the traditional single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by conventional single-tensor tractography. When compared to the dense connectivity maps generated by probabilistic tractography, the method is computationally efficient and generates discrete geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of functionally relevant white matter areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) detects acute ischemic infarcts with high lesion conspicuity. Determination of infarct age is difficult on DWI alone because infarct signal intensity (SIinfarct) on DWI is influenced by T-2 properties ("T-2 shine-through"). Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reflect pure diffusion characteristics without T-2 effects but have low lesion conspicuity. Thus, in clinical practice, combined use of DWI and ADC maps is required. Exponential DWI (eDWI) is an innovative means of MRI-diffusion data analysis that merges the advantages of DWI and ADC maps. The authors hypothesized that SIinfarct on eDWI would correlate with infarct age. The authors studied 114 consecutive patients who had 120 ischemic strokes with clearly determined onset times and who underwent echo-planar DWI. The eDWI were generated by dividing the signal intensity on DWI by that on the corresponding T-2 image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SIinfarct on eDWI was measured in the lesion core and expressed as a percentage of contralateral control tissue. On eDWI, relative SIinfarct changed significantly with infarct age (P < .0001). When patients were sorted in infarct-age groups, no significant differences were found within the first 120 hours. However, for patients studied within 5 days, the mean relative SIinfarct was significantly higher compared with patients studied greater than or equal to8 days after stroke (P < .05). For all infarcts up to 5 days old, the eDWI signal intensity was higher than control tissue (hyperintense appearance). All infarcts > 10 days old had an eDWI signal intensity lower than control tissue (hypointense appearance). The authors concluded that the use of eDWI, as a single set of images, reliably differentiates acute infarcts (less than or equal to5 days old) from infarcts > 10 days old. This feature would be expected to be helpful when the distinction between acute and nonacute infarction cannot be determined on clinical grounds.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and consequent apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps have been used for lesion detection and as a predictor of outcome in adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but few studies have been reported in children. We evaluated the role of DWI and ADC for outcome prediction after pediatric TBI (n = 37 TBI; n = 10 controls). Fifteen regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on ADC maps that were grouped for analysis into peripheral gray matter, peripheral white matter, deep gray and white matter, and posterior fossa. All ROIs excluded areas that appeared abnormal on T2-weighted images (T2WI). Acute injury severity was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and 6-12-month outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score. Patients were categorized into five groups: (1) controls; (2) all TBI patients; (3) mild/moderate TBI with good outcomes; (4) severe TBI with good outcomes; and (5) severe TBI with poor outcomes. ADC values in the peripheral white matter were significantly reduced in children with severe TBI with poor outcomes (72.8 +/- 14.4 X 10(-3) mm(2)/sec) compared to those with severe TBI and good outcomes (82.5 +/- 3.8 X 10(-3) mm(2)/sec; p < 0.05). We also found that the average total brain ADC value alone had the greatest ability to predict outcome and could correctly predict outcome in 84% of cases. Assessment of DWI and ADC values in pediatric TBI is useful in evaluating injury, particularly in brain regions that appear normal on conventional imaging. Early identification of children at high risk for poor outcome may assist in aggressive clinical management of pediatric TBI patients.

N2  -  The mechanisms underlying the progressive course of multiple sclerosis (MS) are not fully understood yet. Since diffusion tensor (DT) MRI can provide quantitative estimates of both MRI-visible and MRI-occult brain damage related to MS, the present study investigated the value of DT MRI-derived measures for the assessment of the short-term accumulation of white and gray matter (GM) pathology in patients with primary progressive (PP) and secondary progressive (SP) MS. Fifty-four patients with PPMS and 22 with SPMS were studied at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 15 months. Dual-echo, T1-weighted, and DT MRI scans of the brain were acquired on both occasions. Total lesion volumes (TLV) and percentage brain volume changes (PBVC) were computed. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the normal-appearing white (NAWM) and gray matter (NAGM) were produced, and histogram analysis was performed. In both patient groups, a significant increase of average lesion MD (P = 0.01) and of average NAGM MD (P = 0.007) was found at follow-up. No significant differences between PPMS and SPMS patient groups were found for the on-study changes of any MRI-derived measure. No significant correlations were found between the percentage changes of DT MRI-derived measures and those of TLV and PBVC. No significant changes of DT MRI-derived measures were observed in age-matched healthy controls over the same study period. Over a 1-year period of follow-up, DT MRI can detect tissue changes beyond the resolution of conventional MRI in the NAGM of patients with progressive MS. The accumulation of DT MRI-detectable gray matter damage does not seem to merely depend upon the concomitant increase of T2-visible lesion load and the reduction of brain volume. These observations suggest that progressive NAGM damage might yet be an additional factor leading to the accumulation of disability in progressive MS. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Semantic dementia, in which there is progressive deterioration of semantic knowledge, is associated with focal, typically asymmetric, temporal lobe degeneration. The ventrorostral temporal lobe is most severely affected and there is concordance between atrophy and reduced metabolic activity. In this study, we confirmed the veracity of this claim using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and anatomical magnetic resonance images. The principal aim, however, was to understand the impact on neuronal projections from the ventrorostral temporal cortex lesion by studying the full extent of white matter changes, with no a priori assumptions about the nature or spatial location of the tracts involved. Using an unbiased voxel-wise approach known as tract-based spatial statistics, we compared results of whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging-absolute metrics of axial, radial and mean diffusion as well as fractional anisotropy-from 10 patients with mild/moderate semantic dementia and 21 matched controls. Distributions of increased absolute diffusivity and reduced fractional anisotropy for patients with semantic dementia were spatially concordant with each other. Abnormalities in all metrics were highly statistically significant in ventrorostral temporal white matter, more extreme on the left side, thus closely matching results from structural and functional imaging of grey matter. The most sensitive marker of change was radial diffusion. Local white matter tract abnormalities extended rostrally towards the frontal lobe and dorsocaudally towards the superior temporal and supramarginal gyri. To examine more remote changes, we performed a skeletonized probabilistic tractography analysis-'seeding' the rostral temporal voxels identified as abnormal in the patient group-in a healthy control group. Three major neural pathways were found to emanate from this 'seed region': uncinate, arcuate and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. At a less conservative threshold, tensor abnormalities in the semantic dementia group mapped onto the tractographies for the uncinate and arcuate bundles well beyond the rostral temporal lobe; this was not the case for the inferior longitudinal bundle, where abnormalities in semantic dementia did not extend caudal to the atrophic/hypometabolic zone. The results offer direct evidence for how the ventrorostral temporal lesion, proposed to be responsible for deteriorating semantic knowledge in semantic dementia and separate from 'classic' language areas, is associated with degeneration of efferent white matter projections to such language areas.

N2  -  This study compared the effectiveness of relative cerebral blood volume, apparent diffusion coefficient, and spectroscopic imaging in differentiating between primary high-grade gliomas and solitary metastases. A 3.0-T MR unit was used to perform proton MR spectroscopy, diffusion imaging, and conventional MR imaging on 26 patients who had solitary brain tumors (14 high-grade gliomas and 12 metastases). All diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy. Twelve perfusion MR studies (8 high-grade gliomas and 4 metastases) were also performed. The results showed that the choline to creatine ratio and relative cerebral blood volume in the peritumoral regions of high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than they were in the metastases. The apparent diffusion coefficient values in tumoral and peritumoral regions of metastases were significantly higher than they were in the primary gliomas. Although conventional MR imaging characteristics of solitary metastases and primary high-grade gliomas may sometimes be similar, the peritumoral perfusion-weighted and spectroscopic MR imaging enable distinction between the two. Diffusion-weighted imaging techniques were complementary techniques to make a differential diagnosis between the two malignant tumors.

N2  -  BackgroundTo determine whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained using a b-value of 3000 s/mm(2) can be used to differentiate high-grade glioma (HGG) from solitary metastases (SM).
MethodsForty patients underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard and high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Minimum, maximum, and mean ADC values (ADC(MIN), ADC(MAX), and ADC(MEAN), respectively) were measured from ADC maps obtained for the two b-values for each subject. ADC ratios were also measured. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff ADC value for distinguishing between HGG and SM.; ResultsAll ADC values for the peritumoral region of the HGGs examined were lower than those for the SM. Furthermore, a larger statistical difference was observed for ADC(MIN), ADC(MAX), and ADC(MEAN) values at a b-value of 3000 smm(2) versus 1000 smm(2) (P<0.0001, P=0.0010, and P=0.0001 versus P=0.0001, 0.0030, and 0.0002, respectively). A discriminant analysis identified the greatest log likelihood for the ADC(MIN) values obtained at a b-value of 3000 smm(2), and the cutoff value for differentiating HGG and SM was 0.890 x 10(-3) mms(2).; ConclusionADC values from DWI using a high b-value were found to distinguish HGG and SM. The lowest degree of overlap was obtained when an ADC(MIN) value was obtained at a b-value of 3000 smm(2). J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;42:80-86. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), a 10-point scale, is a clinical tool for assessment of early ischemic changes after stroke based on the location and extent of a visible stroke lesion. It has been extended for use with MR diffusion-weighted imaging. The purpose of this work was to automate a MR topographical score (MR-TS) using a digital atlas to develop an objective tool for large-scale analyses and possibly reduce interrater variability and slice orientation differences.
Methods-We assessed 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke with a diffusion lesion who provided informed consent. Patients were imaged by CT and MRI within 24 hours of symptom onset. An MR-TS digital atlas was generated using the ASPECTS scoring sheet and anatomic MR data sets. Automated MR topographical scores (auto-MR-TS) were obtained based on the overlap of lesions on apparent diffusion coefficient maps with MR-TS atlas regions. Auto-MR-TS scores were then compared with scores derived manually (man-MR-TS) and with conventional CT ASPECTS scores.; Results-Of the 30 patients, 29 were assessed with auto-MR-TS. Auto-MR-TS was significantly lower than CT ASPECTS (P < 0.001), but with a median difference of only 1 point. There was no significant difference between the auto-MR-TS and the man-MR-TS with a median difference of 0 points; 86% of patient scores differed by <= 1 point.; Conclusion-Auto-MR-TS provides a measure of stroke severity in an automated fashion and facilitates more objective, sensitive, and potentially more complex ASPECTS-based scoring.

N2  -  Purpose Cell size is a fundamental characteristic of all tissues, and changes in cell size in cancer reflect tumor status and response to treatments, such as apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Unfortunately, cell size can currently be obtained only by pathological evaluation of tumor tissue samples obtained invasively. Previous imaging approaches are limited to preclinical MRI scanners or require relatively long acquisition times that are impractical for clinical imaging. There is a need to develop cell-size imaging for clinical applications. Methods We propose a clinically feasible IMPULSED (imaging microstructural parameters using limited spectrally edited diffusion) approach that can characterize mean cell sizes in solid tumors. We report the use of a combination of pulse sequences, using different gradient waveforms implemented on clinical MRI scanners and analytical equations based on these waveforms to analyze diffusion-weighted MRI signals and derive specific microstructural parameters such as cell size. We also describe comprehensive validations of this approach using computer simulations, cell experiments in vitro, and animal experiments in vivo and demonstrate applications in preoperative breast cancer patients. Results With fast acquisitions (7 minutes), IMPULSED can provide high-resolution (1.3 mm in-plane) mapping of mean cell size of human tumors in vivo on clinical 3T MRI scanners. All validations suggest that IMPULSED provides accurate and reliable measurements of mean cell size. Conclusion The proposed IMPULSED method can assess cell-size variations in tumors of breast cancer patients, which may have the potential to assess early response to neoadjuvant therapy.

N2  -  Animal experiments suggest that reorganisation of cerebral representations is the neurobiological basis of post-lesional recovery. In human ischemic brain disease recovery is a dynamic and sustained process beginning after stroke manifestation. The mechanisms underlying recovery can be investigated non-invasively in the human brain using functional neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
In the acute stage, the mismatch area of the perfusion deficit and the impaired water diffusion as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows the brain tissue that potentially can be rescued by thrombolysis or emergency carotid endarteriectomy. Since spontaneous motor recovery is a function of the corticospinal tract integrity, early reperfusion of ischemic tissue is critical. In the subacute and chronic stage after stroke, recovery of motor function was shown to take place irrespective of a concomitant affection of the somatosensory system. Functional MRI with simultaneous recordings of the electromyogram provides evidence that the abnormal activation of motor and premotor cortical areas in both hemispheres related to finger movements has a large interindividual variability. As evident from TMS, recovery results from regression of perilesional inhibition and from remote intracortical disinhibition. Repetitive training, constraint induced training and motor imagery can augment recovery promoting a re-emerging activation in the affected hemisphere.; Evolution of altered local perilesional and large-scale bihemispheric circuits appears to allow for post-lesional deficit compensation.

N2  -  Background: After acute ischemia, the tissue that is at risk of infarction can be detected by perfusion-weighted imaging/diffusion-weighted imaging (PWI/DWI) mismatch but the time that is needed to process PWI limits its use. As DWI is highly sensitive to acute ischemic tissue damage, we hypothesized that different ADC patterns represent areas with a different potential for recovery. Methods: In a model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed to sham surgery and pMCAO. We further separated the pMCAO group according to intralesional ADC pattern (homogeneous or heterogeneous). At 24 h after ischemia induction, we analyzed lesion size, functional outcome, cell death expression, and brain protection markers including ROS enzyme NOX-4. MRI included DWI (ADC maps), DTI (tractography), and PWI (CBF, CBV and MTT). Results: The lesion size was similar in pMCAO rats. Animals with a heterogeneous pattern in ADC maps showed better functional outcome in Rotarod test (p = 0.032), less expression of cell death (p = 0.014) and NOX-4 (p = 0.0063), higher intralesional CBF (p = 0.0026) and larger PWI/DWI mismatch (p = 0.007). Conclusions: In a rodent model for ischemic stroke, intralesional heterogeneity in ADC maps was related to better functional outcome in lesions of similar size and interval after pMCAO. DWI ADC maps may assist in the early identification of ischemic tissue with an increased potential for recovery as higher expression of acute protection markers, lower expression of cell death, increased PWI/DWI mismatch, and higher intralesional CBF were present in animals with a heterogeneous ADC pattern.

N2  -  BackgroundTumor heterogeneity poses major clinical challenges in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Quantitative radiomic analysis with spatial tumor habitat clustering represents an innovative, non-invasive approach to represent and quantify tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. To date, habitat imaging has been applied mainly on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although virtually extendible to any imaging modality, including advanced MRI techniques such as perfusion and diffusion MRI as well as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. ObjectivesThis study aims to evaluate an innovative PET and MRI approach for assessing hypoxia, perfusion, and tissue diffusion in HGGs and derive a combined map for clustering of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Materials and MethodsSeventeen patients harboring HGGs underwent a pre-operative acquisition of MR perfusion (PWI), Diffusion (dMRI) and F-18-labeled fluoroazomycinarabinoside (F-18-FAZA) PET imaging to evaluate tumor vascularization, cellularity, and hypoxia, respectively. Tumor volumes were segmented on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1 post-contrast images, and voxel-wise clustering of each quantitative imaging map identified eight combined PET and physiologic MRI habitats. Habitats' spatial distribution, quantitative features and histopathological characteristics were analyzed. ResultsA highly reproducible distribution pattern of the clusters was observed among different cases, particularly with respect to morphological landmarks as the necrotic core, contrast-enhancing vital tumor, and peritumoral infiltration and edema, providing valuable supplementary information to conventional imaging. A preliminary analysis, performed on stereotactic bioptic samples where exact intracranial coordinates were available, identified a reliable correlation between the expected microenvironment of the different spatial habitats and the actual histopathological features. A trend toward a higher representation of the most aggressive clusters in WHO (World Health Organization) grade IV compared to WHO III was observed. ConclusionPreliminary findings demonstrated high reproducibility of the PET and MRI hypoxia, perfusion, and tissue diffusion spatial habitat maps and correlation with disease-specific histopathological features.

N2  -  The use of quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to investigate the extent and mechanism of hyperthermic damage in biological tissues has been studied. By using the multiple delay-multiple echo and pulsed-gradient spin echo MR imaging sequences, multiple frame MR images of freshly harvested rabbit tissues (brain, kidney, and muscle) and intact duck embryos in shells were obtained before and after heat treatment (45-degrees-C for 30 min) using a clinical 1.5-Tesla whole-body superconducting MR scanner. Based on the relaxation and diffusion models, maps of the proton spin density, relaxation times, and various self-diffusion parameters of tissue water were generated from these multiple frame MR images. Our results indicated that the values of the diffusion barrier size and fractal parameter of the tissues and the self-diffusion coefficient of tissue water increased significantly, i.e., approached that of free water, after the heat treatment. In comparison, only slight changes in the spin density and relaxation times of the tissue water were found after the identical heat treatment. We concluded that the significant changes in the self-diffusive behavior of the tissue water are due to the denaturation of macromolecules (e.g., protein and fiber) within the tissues at elevated temperatures. We further suggested that MR diffusion imaging represents a powerful tool to investigate the extent and mechanism of heat damage of biological tissues in vivo and therefore bears important potential in the clinical assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of hyperthermia in cancer therapy.

N2  -  Conductivity tensor imaging (CTI) has been recently proposed to map the conductivity tensor in 3D using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the frequency range of the brain at rest, i.e., low-frequencies. Conventional CTI mapping methods process the trans-receiver phase of the MRI signal using the MR electric properties tomography (MR-EPT) technique, which in turn involves the application of the Laplace operator. This results in CTI maps with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), artifacts at tissue boundaries and a limited spatial resolution. In order to improve on these aspects, a methodology independent from the MR-EPT method is proposed. This relies on the strong assumption for which electrical conductivity is univocally pre-determined by water concentration. In particular, CTI maps are calculated by combining high-frequency conductivity derived from water maps and multi b-value diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Following the implementation of a pipeline to optimize the pre-processing of diffusion data and the fitting routine of a multi-compartment diffusivity model, reconstructed conductivity images were evaluated in terms of the achieved spatial resolution in five healthy subjects scanned at rest. We found that the pre-processing of diffusion data and the optimization of the fitting procedure improve the quality of conductivity maps. We achieve reproducible measurements across healthy participants and, in particular, we report conductivity values across subjects of 0.55 +/- 0.01S/m, 0.3 +/- 0.01S/m and 2.15 +/- 0.02S/m for gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively. By attaining an actual spatial resolution of the conductivity tensor close to 1 mm in-plane isotropic, partial volume effects are reduced leading to good discrimination of tissues with similar conductivity values, such as GM and WM. The application of the proposed framework may contribute to a better definition of the head tissue compartments in electroencephalograpy/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) source imaging and be used as biomarker for assessing conductivity changes in pathological conditions, such as stroke and brain tumors.

N2  -  Objectives To investigate the usefulness of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in evaluating cortical tubers, especially epileptogenic tubers in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Methods High-resolution conventional MRI and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging were performed in 27 TSC patients. Diffusion images were fitted to NODDI and DTI models. Tubers were visually assessed on different image types and scored by two neuroradiologists. For 10 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery, the contrast ratios between lesion and background tissue were measured on different image types, and these were compared between 16 epileptogenic tubers and 92 non-epileptogenic tubers. Results There were significant differences in lesion conspicuity scores and lesion-background contrast ratios across different sequences (both p < 0.001). The post hoc analysis showed that both the conspicuity scores and contrast ratios of intracellular volume fraction (ICVF) derived from NODDI were higher than other image types. For the 16 epileptogenic tubers, lesion visibility on ICVF was better/equal in 4/12 tubers compared with conventional MRI and better/equal in 5/11 tubers compared with DTI. Significant differences were observed between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tubers on diffusion maps, especially on orientation dispersion index derived from NODDI (p < 0.0001). Conclusions ICVF demonstrated higher contrast than conventional MRI and DTI, which helped detection of subtle epileptogenic tubers. Moreover, NODDI parameters showed the potential to identify epileptogenicity.

N2  -  BackgroundPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinic-radiological entity characterized by headache, an altered mental status, visual disturbances, and seizures. Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) is a new clinic-radiological syndrome characterized by the presence of reversible lesions with transiently restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema) in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Here we report a rare case involving a 23-year-old pregnant woman with eclampsia who sequentially developed PRES and RESLES.Case presentationThe patient, a 23-year-old pregnant woman, presented with sudden-onset headache, dizziness, and severe hypertension (blood pressure, 170/110mmHg). Brain MR imaging (MRI) revealed T2 hyperintense lesions in the posterior circulation territories. Immediate cesarean section was performed, and the patient received intravenous infusion of mannitol (125ml, q8h) for 8days for the treatment of PRES. Ten days later, or 1day after the discontinuation of mannitol, T2-weighted MRI showed that the hyperintense lesions (vasogenic edema) had disappeared. However, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping revealed an isolated lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) that was accompanied by restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema); these findings indicated reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES). Five days after the discontinuation of mannitol, she had no abnormal symptoms and was discharged from our hospital. Brain MRI performed 29days after the clinical onset of symptoms showed no abnormalities.ConclusionThe sequential occurrence of the two reversible diseases in our patient prompted us to propose a novel pathogenesis for RESLES. Specifically, we believe that the vasogenic edema in PRES was reduced with mannitol treatment, which increased the hyperosmotic stress and opened the blood-brain barrier; meanwhile, upregulation of aquaporin-4 expression secondary to the increased osmotic pressure resulted in cytotoxic edema in the astrocytes in SCC (RESLES). Further research is necessary to confirm this possible pathogenesis.

N2  -  Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging provides better understanding of pathophysiology of congenital anomalies, involving central nervous system. This study was aimed to specify the pathogenetic mechanism of heterotopia, proved by diffusion tensor imaging, and establish new findings of heterotopia on fractional anisotropy maps. Materials and Methods: Diffusion-weighted imaging data from 11 patients (M : F = 7 : 4, aged from 1 to 22 years, mean = 12.3 years) who visited the epilepsy clinic and received a routine seizure protocol MRI exam were retrospectively analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated from diffusion tensor imaging of 11 patients with heterotopia. Regions of interests (ROI) were placed in cerebral cortex, heterotopic gray matter and deep gray matter, including putamen. ANOVA analysis was performed for comparison of different gray matter tissues. Results: Heterotopic gray matter showed signal intensities similar to normal gray matter on T1 and T2 weighted MRI. The measured FA of heterotopic gray matter was higher than that of cortical gray matter (0.236 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.169 +/- 0.015, p < 0.01, one way ANOVA), and slightly lower than that of deep gray matter (0.236 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.259 +/- 0.016, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Increased FA of heterotopic gray matter suggests arrested neuron during radial migration and provides better understanding of neurodevelopment.

N2  -  Purpose:
Our study aimed to investigate the role of histogram analysis derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in brain metastases (BMs) from lung cancer for differentiating histological subtype.; Methods:; A total of 61 BMs (45 non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC comprising 32 adenocarcinoma AC, 13 squamous cell carcinoma SCC, and 16 small-cell lung cancer SCLC) in 50 patients with histopathologically confirmed lung cancer were retrospectively included in this study. Pretreatment cranial diffusion-weighted imaging was performed, and the corresponding ADC maps were generated. Regions of interest were drawn on solid components of the BM on all slices of the ADC maps to obtain parameters, including ADC(max), ADC(mean), ADC(min), ADC(median), ADC(range), skewness, kurtosis, entropy, ADC(10), ADC(25), ADC(75), and ADC(90). Apparent diffusion coefficient histogram parameters were compared among histological type groups. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, chi-square tests, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used for statistical assessment.; Results:; ADC(min,) ADC(10), and ADC(25) were found to be significantly different among AC, SCC, and SCLC groups; these parameters were higher for AC group, moderate for SCC group, and significantly lower for SCLC group. Skewness and kurtosis were not significantly different among all groups. The ROC analysis for differentiating BMs of NSCLC from SCLC showed that ADC(25) achieved the highest area under the curve at 0.922 with 93.02% sensitivity and 81.25% specificity.; Conclusion:; Apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis of BMs from lung cancer has significant prognostic value in differentiating histological subtypes of lung cancer.

N2  -  Purpose: To automatically differentiate radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor at high spatial resolution using multiparametric MRI features.
Materials and Methods: MRI data retrieved from 31 patients (15 recurrent tumor and 16 radiation necrosis) who underwent chemoradiation therapy after surgical resection included post-gadolinium T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, proton density, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) -derived relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and mean transit time maps. After alignment to post contrast T1WI, an eight-dimensional feature vector was constructed. An one-class-support vector machine classifier was trained using a radiation necrosis training set. Classifier parameters were optimized based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The classifier was then tested on the full dataset.; Results: The sensitivity and specificity of optimized classifier for pseudoprogression was 89.91% and 93.72%, respectively. The area under ROC curve was 0.9439. The distribution of voxels classified as radiation necrosis was supported by the clinical interpretation of follow-up scans for both nonprogressing and progressing test cases. The ADC map derived from diffusion-weighted imaging and rCBV, rCBF derived from PWI were found to make a greater contribution to the discrimination than the conventional images.; Conclusion: Machine learning using multiparametric MRI features may be a promising approach to identify the distribution of radiation necrosis tissue in resected glioblastoma multiforme patients undergoing chemoradiation.

N2  -  Gliomas are the most common intra-axial primary brain tumour; therefore, predicting glioma grade would influence therapeutic strategies. Although several methods based on single or multiple parameters from diagnostic images exist, a definitive method for pre-operatively determining glioma grade remains unknown. We aimed to develop an unsupervised method using multiple parameters from pre-operative diffusion tensor images for obtaining a clustered image that could enable visual grading of gliomas. Fourteen patients with low-grade gliomas and 19 with high-grade gliomas underwent diffusion tensor imaging and three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before tumour resection. Seven features including diffusion-weighted imaging, fractional anisotropy, first eigenvalue, second eigenvalue, third eigenvalue, mean diffusivity and raw T2 signal with no diffusion weighting, were extracted as multiple parameters from diffusion tensor imaging. We developed a two-level clustering approach for a self-organizing map followed by the K-means algorithm to enable unsupervised clustering of a large number of input vectors with the seven features for the whole brain. The vectors were grouped by the self-organizing map as protoclusters, which were classified into the smaller number of clusters by K-means to make a voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered image. Furthermore, we also determined if the diffusion tensor-based clustered image was really helpful for predicting pre-operative glioma grade in a supervised manner. The ratio of each class in the diffusion tensor-based clustered images was calculated from the regions of interest manually traced on the diffusion tensor imaging space, and the common logarithmic ratio scales were calculated. We then applied support vector machine as a classifier for distinguishing between low- and high-grade gliomas. Consequently, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves from the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images that showed the best performance for differentiating high- and low-grade gliomas were 0.848, 0.745, 0.804 and 0.912, respectively. Furthermore, the log-ratio value of each class of the 16-class diffusion tensor-based clustered images was compared between low- and high-grade gliomas, and the log-ratio values of classes 14, 15 and 16 in the high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than those in the low-grade gliomas (p < 0.005, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). These classes comprised different patterns of the seven diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters. The results suggest that the multiple diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters from the voxel-based diffusion tensor-based clustered images can help differentiate between low-and high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  The tumor microenvironment is a critical regulator of cancer development and progression as well as treatment response and resistance in brain neoplasms. The available techniques for investigation, however, are not well suited for noninvasive in vivo characterization in humans. A total of 120 patients (59 females; 61 males) with newly diagnosed contrast-enhancing brain tumors (64 glioblastoma, 20 brain metastases, 15 primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas (PCNSLs), and 21 meningiomas) were examined with a previously established physiological MRI protocol including quantitative blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging and vascular architecture mapping. Six MRI biomarker maps for oxygen metabolism and neovascularization were fused for classification of five different tumor microenvironments: glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), hypoxia with/without neovascularization, and necrosis. Glioblastoma showed the highest metabolic heterogeneity followed by brain metastasis with a glycolysis-to-OxPhos ratio of approximately 2:1 in both tumor entities. In addition, glioblastoma revealed a significant higher percentage of hypoxia (24%) compared to all three other brain tumor entities: brain metastasis (7%; p < 0.001), PCNSL (8%; p = 0.001), and meningioma (8%; p = 0.003). A more aggressive biological brain tumor behavior was associated with a higher percentage of hypoxia and necrosis and a lower percentage of remaining vital tumor tissue and aerobic glycolysis. The proportion of oxidative phosphorylation, however, was rather similar (17-26%) for all four brain tumor entities. Tumor microenvironment (TME) mapping provides insights into neurobiological differences of contrast-enhancing brain tumors and deserves further clinical cancer research attention. Although there is a long roadmap ahead, TME mapping may become useful in order to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

N2  -  Massive glutamate release is an important factor leading to ionic imbalance after occlusive stroke, which in turn contributes to cytotoxic edema formation. Currently, measurements of cytotoxic edema using 'diffusion weighted' MRI, is being used in human stroke studies, as a 'surrogate' end point for neuroprotective drug trials, including studies with glutamate antagonists. However, it is not fully understood to what extent glutamate-mediated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation is related to 'cytotoxic' edema formation, and thus, to what degree apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging with 'ACD mapping', represent NMDA receptor activation. To study this relationship, four cats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Edema formation was investigated using MRI with 'ACD mapping', while NMDA receptor activation was simultaneously detected in the same animals, using radio labeled (125)lodoMK-801, which binds only in activated and open NMDA channels. At 5 h post-occlusion, a large area of edema could be found with significantly lower ADC values in the core and penumbral area of the ischemic lesion when compared to contralateral values. On corresponding sections of the feline brains, increased I-125-MK-801 binding was found in the infarct penumbra. However, there was no significant topographical correlation between ADC values and measured radioactivity. The results indicate that there is not a significant linkage between NMDA receptor activation and 'cytotoxic' edema following permanent MCAO. The detection of a large area of NMDA channel activation within regions of low ADC does however indicate an area of 'penumbral' ischemia susceptible to treatment with NMDA channel blockers.

N2  -  The present study reported on the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). A total of 19 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of PACNS confirmed by clinical follow-up were enrolled in the present study. All patients underwent unenhanced and enhanced MRI prior to and after steroids or steroids plus immunosuppressive therapy. At baseline, all patients showed lesions on MRI in the grey and white matter. Lesions presented as slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1WI), slightly hyperintense on T2WI, hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, iso- or slightly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and hyperintense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. After contrast injection, the lesions showed patchy, cord-like or goral enhancement. Seven cases had unilateral lesions and the other 12 cases had bilateral lesions. On all sequences, indistinct margins characterised most of the lesions, and certain lesions were oedematous. Treatment with steroids or steroids plus immunosuppressive agents resulted in improvement or disappearance of symptoms, and seventeen patients had evidently improved according to MRI. In conclusion, PACNS has unique characteristics on MRI; DWI, ADC mapping and enhanced images are of great importance for the diagnosis and clinical management of early-stage PACNS.

N2  -  Purpose: Monitoring tumor response during the course of treatment and adaptively modifying treatment plan based on tumor biological feedback may represent a new paradigm for radiotherapy. Diffusion MRI has shown great promises in assessing and predicting tumor response to radiotherapy. However, the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar-imaging (DW-ssEPI) technique suffers from limited resolution, severe distortion, and possibly inaccurate ADC at low field strength. The purpose of this work was to develop a reliable, accurate and distortion-free diffusion MRI technique that is practicable for longitudinal tumor response evaluation and adaptive radiotherapy on a 0.35 T MRI-guided radiotherapy system.
Methods: A diffusion-prepared turbo spin echo readout (DP-TSE) sequence was developed and compared with the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence on a 0.35 T MRI-guided radiotherapy system (ViewRay). A spatial integrity phantom was used to quantitate and compare the geometric accuracy of the two diffusion sequences for three orthogonal orientations. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) accuracy was evaluated on a diffusion phantom under both 0 degrees C and room temperature to cover a diffusivity range between 0.40 x 10(-3) and 2.10 x 10(-3) mm(2)s. Ten room temperature measurements repeated on five different days were conducted to assess the ADC reproducibility of DP-TSE. Two glioblastoma (GBM) and six sarcoma patients were included to examine the in vivo feasibility. The target registration error (TRE) was calculated to quantitate the geometric accuracy where structural CT or MR images were co-registered to the diffusion images as references. ADC maps from DP-TSE and DW-ssEPI were calculated and compared. A tube phantom was placed next to patients not treated on ViewRay, and ADCs of this reference tube were also compared.; Results: The proposed DP-TSE passed the spatial integrity test (< 1 mm within 100 mm radius and < 2 mm within 175 mm radius) under the three orthogonal orientations. The detected errors were 0.474 0.355 mm, 0.475 +- 0.287 mm, and 0.546 +- 0.336 mm in the axial, coronal, and sagittal plane. DW-ssEPI, however, failed the tests due to severe distortion and low signal intensity. Noise correction must be performed for the DW-ssEPI to avoid ADC quantitation errors, whereas it is optional for DP-TSE. At 0 degrees C, the two sequences provided accurate quantitation with < 3% variation with the reference. In the room temperature study, discrepancies between ADCs from DP-TSE and the reference were within 4%, but could be as high as 8% for DW-ssEPI after the noise correction. Excellent ADC reproducibility with a coefficient of variation < 5% was observed among the 10 measurements of DP-TSE, indicating desirable robustness for ADC-based tumor response assessment. In vivo TRE in DP-TSE was less than 1.6 mm overall, whereas it could be greater than 12 mm in DW-ssEPI. For GBM patients, the CSF and brain tissue ADCs from DP-TSE were within the ranges found in literature. ADC differences between the two techniques were within 8% among the six sarcoma patients. For the reference tube that had a relatively low diffusivity, the two diffusion sequences provided matched measurements.; Conclusion: A diffusion technique with excellent geometric fidelity, accurate, and reproducible ADC measurement was demonstrated for longitudinal tumor response assessment using a low-field MRI-guided radiotherapy system.

N2  -  Increasing numbers needed to treat within the first hours after ischemic stroke onset indicate a strong time dependency of the viability of brain tissue. However, this time dependency is not reflected in recent randomized controlled trials of endovascular stroke treatment. This study evaluates whether and to which extent a time dependency exists in patients with embolic carotid T or M1 occlusions within the first 6 h of stroke onset.
Patient data were retrieved from the Freiburg stroke data bank. Time from onset to acquisition of the diffusion weighted images (DWIs) varied between 49 and 357 min. Ischemic lesions were semiautomatically segmented on apparent diffusion coefficient maps with a threshold of 600 x 10 (- 6) mm(2)s. Occlusion location and thrombus length were determined with magnetic resonance angiography, T2*, and more recently susceptibility weighted image (SWI) sequences. A hyperintense vessel sign in FLAIR images as a possible surrogate for collaterals was also identified.; A total of 155 patients with occlusions of the carotid T (n = 26), proximal M1 segment (n = 44), and distal M1 segment (n = 85) of the middle cerebral artery between 2011 and 2015 were included. Infarct volumes varied from 0.3 to 180.2 mL. Infarct size did not correlate with stroke onset to DWI times. Infarct volumes also did not associate with different locations of vessel occlusion, thrombus length, presence of the hyperintense vessel sign and initial infarct growth.; We found no significant time dependency of the viability of brain tissue with embolic carotid T or M1 occlusions between 1 and 6 h after stroke onset. The early infarction volume is thus probably determined in the hyperacute phase by the quality of leptomeningeal collaterals and comparatively stable in this time period.

N2  -  Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine whether the patterns of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) abnormalities and quantitative regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can predict the clinical outcome of comatose patients following cardiac arrest.
Methods: Thirty-nine patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were prospectively investigated. Within five days of resuscitation, axial DWIs were obtained and ADC maps were generated using two 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanners. The neurological outcomes of the patients were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score at three months after the cardiac arrest. The brain injuries were categorised into four patterns: normal, isolated cortical injury, isolated deep grey nuclei injury, and mixed injuries (cortex and deep grey nuclei). Twenty-three subjects with normal DWIs served as controls. The ADC and percent ADC values (the ADC percentage as compared to the control data from the corresponding region) were obtained in various regions of the brains. We analysed the differences between the favourable (GOS score 4 to 5) and unfavourable (GOS score 1 to 3) groups with regard to clinical data, the DWI abnormalities, and the ADC and percent ADC values.; Results: The restricted diffusion abnormalities in the cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus were significantly different between the favourable (n = 13) and unfavourable (n = 26) outcome groups. The cortical pattern of injury was seen in one patient (3%), the deep grey nuclei pattern in three patients (8%), the cortex and deep grey nuclei pattern in 21 patients (54%), and normal DWI findings in 14 patients (36%). The cortex and deep grey nuclei pattern was significantly associated with the unfavourable outcome (20 patients with unfavourable vs. 1 patient with favourable outcomes, P < 0.001). In the 22 patients with quantitative ADC analyses, severely reduced ADCs were noted in the unfavourable outcome group. The optimal cutoffs for the mean ADC and the percent ADC values determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus predicted the unfavourable outcome with sensitivities of 67 to 93% and a specificity of 100%.; Conclusions: The patterns of brain injury in early diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (less than or equal to five days after resuscitation) and the quantitative measurement of regional ADC may be useful for predicting the clinical outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

N2  -  Six patients having Wilson's disease were studied with diffusion MRI in order to characterize cerebral lesions. Diffusion MRI was obtained using the spin-echo, echo-planar sequence with a gradient strength of 30 mT/m. The trace protocol was used in the axial imaging plane. Heavily diffusion-weighted (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) images, and the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values from automatically generated ADC maps were studied. The ADC values of the normal brain parenchyma were available in 17 age-matched cases for comparison (ADC values, 0.85 +/- 0.11 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s). In Wilson's disease two distinct diffusion MRI patterns were observed by quantitative evaluations of the ADC maps; cytotoxic edema-like (ADC values, 0.52 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and vasogenic edema-like (ADC values, 1.42 +/- 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) patterns. Diffusion imaging appears to be a promising sequence to evaluate the changes in the brain tissue in Wilson's disease at least by revealing two different patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

N2  -  For the past decade, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used in elucidation of the motor recovery mechanisms in stroke patients. In the current study, I reviewed the DTI studies with regard to the motor recovery mechanisms in stroke patients, according to the following classification of motor recovery mechanisms; recovery of a damaged lateral corticospinal tract (CST), subcortical peri-lesional reorganization, ipsilateral motor pathway from the unaffected motor cortex to the affected extremities, and other motor recovery mechanisms. In addition, I discussed the characteristics of DTI as an evaluation tool for motor recovery mechanisms and future direction. DTI has a unique advantage in identification and estimation of neural tracts at the subcortical level. Therefore, it could contribute much to research on the motor recovery mechanisms of stroke patients, especially, in terms of recovery of a damaged CST and subcortical peri-lesional reorganization. In spite of the advantages of DTI, fewer DTI studies on this topic have been conducted compared to studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation or functional MRI. Therefore, the total number of DTI studies on this topic should be increased. Moreover, further studies on various topics related to brain plasticity of motor function, as well as the motor recovery mechanism itself, should be encouraged; for example, DTI changes with passage of time, with rehabilitative intervention, or with motor recovery.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate and delineate the characteristics of cerebral toxoplasmosis lesions using a combination of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, diffusion, and perfusion studies.
Material and Methods: A total of 8 patients with 23 lesions were evaluated on a 1.5-T MR system. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed with three 'b' values of 50, 500, and 1000smm(2), and the apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated. The diffusion-weighted appearances and the T2-weighted MR appearances of the lesions were compared. MR spectroscopy was performed using the point-resolved single-voxel technique with two TE values of 135 ins and 270 ms. Perfusion studies were carried out using the dynamic contrast-enhanced technique, and the relative cerebral blood volume maps were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed.; Results: DWI revealed the majority of the lesions as having increased diffusion within their necrotic centers, with the ADC ranging from 0.5 to 3.01 (mean +- SD: 1.49 +- 0.7). All the lesions revealed a predominant lipid peak on MR spectroscopy and were extremely hypovascular on perfusion MR studies.; Conclusion: MR diffusion, spectroscopy, and perfusion studies help in characterizing toxoplasmosis lesions and, in most cases, can be used in combination to help establish the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with an array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map values with different b values to distinguish benign and malignant breast lesions.
Materials and Methods: Fifty-six female patients with 60 histologically proven breast lesions and 20 healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging. A subset of normal volunteers (n = 7) and patients (n = 16) underwent both conventional DWI and ASSET-DWI, and the image quality between the two methods was compared. Finally, ASSET-DWI with b = 0, 600 smm(2), and b = 0, 1000 smm(2), were compared for their ability to distinguish benign and malignant breast lesions.; Results: The ASSET-DWI method had less distortion, fewer artifacts, and a lower acquisition time than other methods. No significant difference (P > .05) was detected in ADC map values between ASSET-DWI and conventional DWI. For ASSET-DWI, the sensitivity of ADC values for malignant lesions with a threshold of less than 1.44 x 10(-3) mm(2)s (b = 600 smm(2)) and 1.18 x 10-3 mm(2)s (b = 1000 smm(2)) was 80% and 77.5%, respectively. The specificity of both groups was 95%.; Conclusion: ASSET-DWI evaluation of breast tissue offers decreased distortion, susceptibility to artifacts, and acquisition time relative to other methods. The use of ASSET-DWI is feasible with b values ranging from 600 to 1000 smm(2) and provides increased specificity compared to other techniques. Thus, the ADC value of a breast lesion can be used to further characterize malignant lesions from benign ones.

N2  -  Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a debilitating and often refractory psychiatric disorder. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is a novel, minimally invasive neuromodulatory technique that has shown promise in treating this condition.
We investigated the relationship between lesion location and long-term outcome in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with focused ultrasound to discern the optimal lesion location and elucidate the efficacious network underlying symptom alleviation. Postoperative images of 11 patients who underwent focused ultrasound capsulotomy were used to correlate lesion characteristics with symptom improvement at 1-year follow-up. Normative resting-state functional MRI and normative diffusion MRI-based tractography analyses were used to determine the networks associated with successful lesions. Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with inferior thalamic peduncle deep brain stimulation (n = 5) and lesions from the literature implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 18) were used for external validation. Successful long-term relief of obsessive-compulsive disorder was associated with lesions that included a specific area in the dorsal anterior limb of the internal capsule.; Normative resting-state functional MRI analysis showed that lesion engagement of areas 24 and 46 was significantly associated with clinical outcomes (R = 0.79, P = 0.004). The key role of areas 24 and 46 was confirmed by (i) normative diffusion MRI-based tractography analysis, showing that streamlines associated with better outcome projected to these areas; (ii) association of these areas with outcomes in patients receiving inferior thalamic peduncle deep brain stimulation (R = 0.83, P = 0.003); and (iii) the connectedness of these areas to obsessivecompulsive disorder-causing lesions, as identified using literature-based lesion network mapping.; These results provide considerations for target improvement, outlining the specific area of the internal capsule critical for successful magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound outcome and demonstrating that discrete frontal areas are involved in symptom relief. This could help refine focused ultrasound treatment for obsessivecompulsive disorder and provide a network-based rationale for potential alternative targets.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) in the differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain lesions, on the basis of DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy ( FA) and mean diffusivity ( MD) from the lesion ( L) and the perilesional edema ( PE). Material and Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed 25 neoplastic [ 10 high grade gliomas ( HGG), 11 metastases, 4 low grade glioma ( LGG)] and 25 non-neoplastic [ 13 tuberculomas and 12 neurocysticercosis ( NCC)] brain lesions underwent an MRI, including the DTI sequences. Fractional anisotropy from the lesion ( FAL) and mean diffusivity from the lesion ( MDL), as well as fractional anisotropy from the perilesional edema ( FAPE), and mean diffusivity from the perilesional edema ( MDPE) were calculated and quantified using region of interest ( ROI) based assessment on DTI derived FA and MD parametric maps. The mean values of FAL, FAPE, MDL and MDPE from the two groups were compared by the independent sample t-test. Results: In the non-neoplastic group, perilesional edema showed a significantly higher ( P = 0.015) MD compared to the neoplastic group. Perilesional FA and lesional FA and MD showed no such statistically significant difference. On further subgroup analysis, MDPE was higher in metastases compared to HGG ( P < 0.001), reflecting an increase in the vasogenic edema. Perilesional FA was higher in HGG compared to metastases and tuberculomas ( P < 0.001) reflecting tumour infiltration in addition to vasogenic edema. FAL was higher in tuberculomas compared to metastases ( P < 0.001), pointing to a more microstructural destruction in metastases. Conclusion: Quantitative DTI parameters, FA and MD, from the lesion and from the area of perilesional edema are helpful in the evaluation and differentiation of brain lesions.

N2  -  Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between metabolic 18Fluoro-Deoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (18FDG/PET) and morpho-functional parameters derived by Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) in patients with histologically proven laryngeal cancer. To assess the clinical impact of PET/MRI examination on patient's staging and treatment planning.
Methods: 16 patients with histologically proven laryngeal cancer were enrolled and underwent whole body PETCT followed by a dedicated PETMRI of the headneck region. Data were separately evaluated by two blinded groups: metabolic (SUV and MTV), diffusion (ADC) and perfusion (K-trans, V-e, k(ep) and iAUC) maps were obtained by positioning regions of interest (ROIs). Tumoral local extension assessed on PETMRI was compared to endoscopic findings.; Results: A good inter-observer agreement was found in anatomical location and local extension of PETMRI lesions (Cohen's kappa 0.9). PETCT SUV measures highly correlate with ones derived by PETMRI (e.g., p = 0.96 for measures on VOI). Significant correlations among metabolic, diffusion and perfusion parameters have been detected. PETMRI had a relevant clinical impact, confirming endoscopic findings (6 cases), helping treatment planning (9 cases), and modifying endoscopic primary staging (1 case).; Conclusions: PETMRI is useful for primary staging of laryngeal cancer, allowing simultaneous collection of metabolic and functional data and conditioning the therapeutic strategies.

N2  -  BackgroundDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-DWI) is the modality of choice for detecting intracranial abscesses; however, it is unclear whether prior brain surgery has an influence on its diagnostic value. Thus, we assessed the robustness of MRI-DWI and determination of an ADC cutoff value for detecting intracranial abscesses in patients who underwent brain surgery.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated 19 patients prior to surgery for postoperative supratentorial parenchymal abscesses by means of MRI-DWI. Forty randomly selected patients with routine postoperative MRI-DWI were used for comparative analyses. Clinical and serum biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, white blood cell count) as well as from results of early postoperative imaging findings (computed tomography and/or MRI scan) were recorded. Additionally, ADC values, T1gadolinium, and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences were investigated.ResultsAfter initial surgery, early postoperative control imaging showed evidence of hemorrhage and/or hemostatic agents within the resection cavity in 10/19 patients of the abscess group and in 16/40 patients of the control group. No postoperative ischemia was detected. Neither hemostatic agents nor blood affected the mean ADC values in both the reference group (blood 2.96 +/- 0.22x10(-3)mm(2)/s vs. no blood 2.95 +/- 0.26x10(-3)mm(2)/s, p=0.076) and in the abscess group (blood 0.87 +/- 0.07x10(-3)mm(2)/s vs. no blood 0.76 +/- 0.06x10(-3)mm(2)/s, p=0.128). The mean ADC value within the resection cavity was significantly lower in the abscess group (1.5T 0.88 +/- 0.41 vs. 2.88 +/- 0.20x10(-3)mm(2)/s, p<.01; 3.0T 0.75 +/- 0.24 vs. 3.02 +/- 0.26x10(-3)mm(2)/s, p<0.01). The optimal ADC cut-off for the differentiation of an abscess from normal postoperative findings was found at 1.87x10(-3)mm(2)/s (area-under-the-curve 1.0, sensitivity=100%, specificity=100%). Moreover, no differences between the abscess patients and the control group were seen with respect to the analyzed serum biomarkers.Conclusion p id=Par4 MRI-DWI provides a robust tool to discriminate postoperative abscess formation from normal postoperative changes.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to measure apparent diffusion coefficient values of normal liver parenchyma and focal liver lesions utilizing a respiratory gated diffusion sequence with multiple b-values and to investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements may be utilized to characterize and differentiate between malignant and benign focal hepatic lesions. Thirty-eight consecutive patients underwent MRI of the liver including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). A single-shot echo planar imaging sequence was applied in coronal orientation with multiple b-values (0, 50, 500, 1,000 s/mm(2)) and respiratory gating. ADC values were recorded on corresponding maps utilizing region of interest measurements in patients with benign (group A), malignant (group B) focal lesions and liver parenchyma (group C). Statistical analysis was applied to check whether differences in mean ADC values were significant (p < 0.05). No focal lesions were detected in 11 patients, with a mean ADC value (CI 95%) of liver parenchyma 1.25x10(-3) mm(2)/s (1.21x10(-3) mm(2)/s-1.29x10(-3) mm(2)/s). Differences in mean ADC of liver parenchyma between group A and B were not significant (p=0.054, 1.30x10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.31x10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively). Mean ADC value (95% CI) of 22 benign lesions found in 18 patients was 2.55x10(-3) mm(2)/s (2.35x10-3 mm2/s-2.74x10(-3) mm(2)/s), while the mean ADC value (95% CI) of 16 malignant lesions recorded in 9 patients was 1.04x10(-3) mm(2)/s (0.9x10(-3) mm(2)/s-1.17x10(-3) mm(2)/s). The difference between mean ADC values of benign and malignant focal lesions was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Respiratory gated diffusion-weighted imaging in the liver is technically feasible. Apparent diffusion coefficient measurements can be useful in differentiating malignant from benign focal liver lesions.

N2  -  Objective: Because of the heterogeneous nature of glioma, biopsies performed should be targeted at the most anaplastic region. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) techniques have been proposed for identifying the most anaplastic tumor area. However, it is unclear whether the recommended biopsy targets based on these various functional imaging modalities correspond with each other. Thus, the purpose was to evaluate whether they identify similar target areas.
Materials and Methods: A total of 61 patients with suspected glioma were assessed within 2.3 +- 3.5 days by MRI, (18)F-fluorothymidine-, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Thirty-five patients underwent gross total resection and 26 were stereotactically biopsied. MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla broadband transmitreceive system, using a double-resonant birdcage coil. The MRI protocol comprised of sodium ((23)Na)-MRI (3D-radial projection imaging), proton spectroscopic imaging ((1)H-MRSI, point-resolved spectroscopy), arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and dynamic-susceptibility-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI after a single dose each of gadobenate dimeglumine. Also, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were processed from diffusion tensor images. Image analysis comprised a detailed semiquantitative region of interest analysis of the different parameter values as well as visual identification of the most conspicuous tumor areas on parameter maps, for example, areas with maximum tumor perfusion, highest metabolite ratios of choline-containing compoundsN-acetyl-aspartate, or lowest ADC values within tumor tissue. Colocalization of these areas was then assessed.; Results: Regarding tumor vascularity-related parameters and tumor proliferation-related parameters, the higher the glioma grade the higher were the respective parameters in semiquantitative analysis. ADC values decreased with glioma grade. In the whole study population comprising low- (N = 15) and high-grade gliomas (N = 42), except for (23)Na-MRI, there was good (>50%) or perfect (100%) agreement of the tumor areas with highest values on parameter images in the majority of cases (>80%), that is, tumor areas with increased thymidine-uptake and highest choline, both suggestive of increased tumor proliferation, and elevated microcirculation as demonstrated by DSC-, arterial spin-labeling-, and DCE-MRI. (23)Na-MRI depicted the highest signal within necrotic tumor areas, but non-necrotic gliomas also showed a perfect agreement in more than 61%. (18)F-fluorothymidine-PET, DSC-, and DCE-MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging as well as MR spectroscopic imaging correctly detected no glioma heterogeneity in all 15 histologically proven grade II gliomas but identified suspicious areas in all 3 nonenhancing grade III gliomas.; Conclusion: Both imaging techniques that depict microcirculation and techniques that visualize proliferation identify similar target areas.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion microstructure imaging (DMI) is a fast approach to higher-order diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging that allows robust decomposition and characterization of diffusion properties of brain tissue into intra-axonal, extra-axonal, and a free water-compartment. We now report the application of this technique to acute ischemic stroke and demonstrate its potential applicability to the daily clinical routine. Methods: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke were scanned using an accelerated multi -shell diffusion-weighted imaging protocol (median delay between onset and MRI scan of 113 min). DMI metrics were calculated and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from conventional diffusion-weighted imaging was used for comparison. The resulting DMI parameter maps were analysed for their potential to improve infarct core delineation, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was subsequently per-formed for automated infarct segmentation. Results: Robust parameter maps for diffusion microstructure properties were obtained in all cases. Within the ischemic tissue, an increase in the volume fraction of the intra-axonal compartment was accompanied by a volume fraction reduction in the other two compartments. Moreover, diffusivity was reduced in all three compartments, with intra-axonal diffusivity showing the highest degree of contrast. The intra-axonal diffusion co-efficient maps were subsequently found to perform better than single-shell ADC-derived segmentation in terms of automatic segmentation of the infarct core (area under the curve = 0.98 vs 0.92). Conclusions: The alterations to the ischemic core detected by DMI are in line with the "beading-model " of non-uniform neurite swelling under ischemic conditions. When compared to conventional single-shell diffusion -weighted imaging, DMI metrics are associated with improved discriminative power for delineating and characterizing ischemic changes. This might allow a more detailed assessment of infarct age, severity of damage, the degree of reversibility, and outcome.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Better measures of cerebral tissue perfusion and earlier detection of ischemic injury are needed to guide therapy in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients with vasospasm. We sought to identify tissue ischemia and early ischemic injury with combined diffusion-weighted (DW) and hemodynamically weighted (HW) MRT in patients with vasospasm after SAH,
Methods-Combined DW and HW imaging was used to study 6 patients with clinical and angiographic vasospasm, I patient without clinical signs of vasospasm but with severe angiographic vasospasm, and 1 patient without angiographic spasm. Analysis of the passage of an intravenous contrast bolus through brain was used to construct multislice maps of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and tissue mean transit time (tMTT). We hypothesize that large HW imaging (HWI) abnormalities would be present in treated patients at the time they develop neurological deficit due to vasospasm without matching DW imaging (DWI) abnormalities.; Results-Small, sometimes multiple, ischemic lesions on DWI were seen encircled by a large area of decreased rCBF and increased tMTT in all patients with symptomatic vasospasm. Decreases in rCBV were not prominent. MRI hemodynamic abnormalities occurred in regions supplied by vessels with angiographic vasospasm or in their watershed territories. All patients with neurological deficit showed an area of abnormal tMTT much larger than the area of DWI abnormality. MRI images were normal in the asymptomatic patient with angiographic vasospasm and the patient with normal angiogram and no clinical signs of vasospasm.; Conclusions-We conclude that DWHW MRI in symptomatic vasospasm can detect widespread changes in tissue hemodynamics that encircle early foci of ischemic injury. With additional study, the technique could become a useful tool in the clinical management of patients with SAH.

N2  -  Aim Intraoperative cerebral embolization is a greater concern in patients undergoing carotid-artery stenting (CAS) than in those undergoing the reference standard treatment carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We evaluated cerebral embolism with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and transcranial. Doppler monitoring during CAS and CEA.
Methods. A series of 75 patients with carotid stenosis, 40 undergoing CEA and 35 transfemoral protected CAS, underwent preoperative and postoperative cerebral DW-MRI. Of the 75 patients, 64 (85%) underwent intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring to evaluate the mean number of microembolic signals (MES) recorded in each procedure.; Results. None of the patients died. No patient in the CEA but two in the CAS group had strokes (5.7%, P=NS). The mean MES count on transcranial Doppler monitoring was higher in the CAS than in the CEA group (330.0 MES, range 2 - 754 vs 13.2, range 0-49 MES; P < 0.01). DW-MRI disclosed a significantly larger number of new ischemic lesions in the CAS than in the CEA group (40 lesions in 1235 patients, 34.3% vs 4 lesions in 340 patients, 7.5%; P < 0.01). In the CEA group, all patients with ischemic lesions were asymptomatic whereas in the CAS group 5 were symptomatic (14.3%) and 7 asymptomatic (20%). The cerebral distribution also differed in the two groups: no CEA but 20% of CAS lesions were contralateral.; Conclusion. CAS is associated with a significantly higher rate of cerebral embolization than CEA. Even though the clinical meaning of new postoperative ischemic lesions remains debatable, it seems prudent to reduce the embolic load by improving procedural techniques and cerebral protection devices.

N2  -  Object. During neurosurgical interventions, preservation of subcortical axons is as important as preservation of cortical neurons. The goal of this study was to assess the combined use of functional (f) and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to assist in the preservation of the structure and function of the motor system.
Methods. The authors evaluated the combination of fMR imaging and DW MR imaging to detect cortical motor areas with their corresponding pyramidal tracts in 12 healthy volunteers and in 10 consecutive patients with various space-occupying lesions affecting the central motor system.; Activation within the primary motor cortex (MI) and white matter bundles originating from this cortical region was demonstrated in 21 of the 22 individuals examined. Additional activation was exhibited along the course of white matter tracts at the level of the pons and, in the contralateral hemisphere, in the MI. Fiber tract displacement was visualized in all patients in white matter that had appeared normal on routine T-1- and T-2-weighted MR images.; Conclusions. The combination of DW MR and fMR imaging allows visualization of the origin, direction, and functionality of large white matter tracts. This will prove helpful for imaging structural connectivity within the brain during functional imaging. Moreover, local relationships of cerebral tumors that encroach upon M I and subcortical fiber tracts can be defined. Tl is promises to decrease patient morbidity and to broaden the clinical applications of functional imaging.

N2  -  The repetitive usage of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) is critical for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of tumor burden in glioblastoma patients. It is also a crucial tool for determination of radiographical response to treatment. GBCA injection, however, comes with a 2.4% rate of adverse events including life-threatening conditions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Moreover, GBCA have been shown to be deposited in brain tissue of patients even with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). The present study explores quantitative T1 relaxometry as an alternative non-invasive imaging technique detection of tumor burden and determination of radiographical response. This technique exploits specific properties of brain tissue with impaired BBB. With a sensitivity and specificity as high as 86% and 80%, respectively, quantitative T1-relaxometry allows for detecting contrast-enhancing areas without the use of GBCA. This method could make it unnecessary to subject patients to the risk of adverse events associated with the use of GBCA. Nonetheless, a large-scale analysis is needed to confirm our findings.

N2  -  Introduction. Therapy-induced injury to normal brain tissue is a concern in the treatment of all types of brain tumours. The purpose of this study was to investigate if magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could serve as a potential biomarker for the assessment of radiation-induced long-term white matter injury. Material and methods. DTI- and T1-weighted images of the brain were obtained in 19 former radiotherapy patients [nine men and 10 women diagnosed with astrocytoma (4), pituitary adenoma (6), meningioma (8) and craniopharyngioma (1), average age 57.8 (range 35-71) years]. Average time from radiotherapy to DTI scan was 4.6 (range 2.0-7.1) years. NordicICE software (NIC) was used to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC-maps). The co-registration between T1 images and ADC-maps were done using the auto function in NIC. The co-registration between the T1 images and the patient dose plans were done using the auto function in the treatment planning system Eclipse from Varian. Regions of interest were drawn on the T1-weighted images in NIC based on isocurves from Eclipse. Data was analysed by t-test. Estimates are given with 95% CI. Results. A mean ADC difference of 4.6(0.3;8.9) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.03 was found between paired white matter structures with a mean dose difference of 31.4 Gy. Comparing the ADC-values of the areas with highest dose from the paired data (dose > 33 Gy) with normal white matter (dose < 5 Gy) resulted in a mean dose difference of 44.1 Gy and a mean ADC difference of 7.87(3.15;12.60) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.003. Following results were obtained when looking at differences between white matter mean ADC in average dose levels from 5 to 55 Gy in steps of 10 Gy with normal white matter mean ADC: 5 Gy; 1.91(-1.76;5.58) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.29; 15 Gy; 5.81(1.53;10.11) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.01; 25 Gy; 5.80(2.43;9.18) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.002; 35 Gy; 5.93(2.89;8.97) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.0007; 45 Gy; 4.32(-0.24;8.89) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.06; 55 Gy; -4.04(-14.96;6.89) x 10(-5) mm(2)/s, p = 0.39. Conclusion. The results indicate that the structural integrity of white matter, assessed by ADC-values based on DTI, undergoes changes after radiation therapy starting as early as total dose levels between 5 and 15 Gy.

N2  -  In this study, we introduced a length-normalized parameterization method to establish anatomical correspondence of white matter fiber tracts across subjects and applied this method to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion along the pyramidal tract (PYT) of relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) patients without visible brain lesions. In this approach, the part of the PYT between the lowest slice of the cerebral peduncle and the uppermost slice of the lateral ventricle was reconstructed to establish the anatomical correspondence across subjects using diffusion tensor tractography. Then it was parameterized by normalizing its length and dividing equally the normalized length into a certain number of segments, so that the comparability of each segment across subjects along the PYT was established. Tract-specific diffusion indices, including directionally averaged diffusivity (D-av), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary diffusivity (lambda(1)) and transverse diffusivity (lambda(23)), were obtained from each segment. Thus, the distribution maps of these indices along the PYT were obtained. The distribution maps of D-av, FA, and lambda(23) of RNMO patients were significantly different from those of healthy controls, especially in the lower part of the PYT. The differences may be caused by secondary degeneration to lesions in the spinal cord. In conclusion, a length-normalized parameterization method is proposed to establish anatomical correspondence for the PYT. Compared with existed methods, a major merit of our method is to provide comparability across subjects along the PYT on the basis of diffusion tensor tractography and to make it possible for the quantitative analysis along the fiber tract. This method can also be used to quantitatively analyze other white matter fiber tracts between two definite anatomic landmarks in many neurological or psychiatric diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Clinical problem. Intracerebral cysts are common findings in imaging of the neurocranium and are not always clinically significant. The pathological spectrum of intracerebral cysts is, however, very broad and in addition to incidental findings includes developmental disorders, malformation tumors, primary and secondary neoplasms and infectious etiologies, such as cerebral abscess formation, cysticercosis or residuals after congenital cytomegalovirus infections. Intracerebral cystic defects may be caused by inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as multiple sclerosis as well as by mitochondriopathies, leukodystrophy, electrolyte disturbances or osmotic demyelination syndrome or brain infarctions, e.g. after lacunar infarctions or as encephalomalacic changes after severe traumatic brain injury. Radiological standard procedures. In addition to the radiological findings of cysts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or in computed tomography (CT), the localization, patient age, patient medical history and laboratory diagnostics are helpful for the differential diagnostics.
Methodical innovation. In addition to the morphological assessment, advanced MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging for epidermoids or the use of MR spectroscopy, can provide valuable information for the differential diagnosis.; Performanceassessment. Intracranial cysts can be subdivided into intraventricular and periventricular cysts, intra-axial cysts and cysts in the external fluid-filled spaces. Associated tumor nodules and the contrast medium behavior of the cyst walls andor associated soft tissue components as well as the reaction of the adjacent parenchyma are helpful for the diagnosis and assessment.

N2  -  Magnetic resonance technology is continually improging. Fungtional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion imaging, diffusion imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging are increasingly used in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors in children. However, estimate of tumor size remains the primary imaging endpoint in the evaluation of response to treatment, and validation across institutions and vendor platforms of magnetic resonance imaging functional parameters is necessary given the relatively uncommon occurrence of brain tumors in children. Pediatric neuroimaging can be challenging, and the optimal way to image children with tumors of the central nervous system is not uniformly applied accross all centers. Application of proper scanning techniques and validation of functional imaging techniques should lead to improved care of children with central nervous system tumors.

N2  -  Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may induce neurological issues, impacting brain structure and stroke recovery. Limited studies have explored its effects on post-stroke rehabilitation. Our study compares brain structure and connectivity, assessing rehabilitation outcomes based on pre-stroke COVID-19 infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 299 post-stroke rehabilitation cases from May 2021 to January 2023 included two groups: those diagnosed with COVID-19 at least two weeks before stroke onset (COVID group) and those without (control group). Criteria involved first unilateral supratentorial stroke, <3 months post-onset, initial MR imaging, and pre- and post-rehabilitation clinical assessments. Propensity score matching ensured age, sex, and initial clinical assessment similarities. Using lesion mapping, tract-based statistical analysis, and group-independent component analysis MRI scans were assessed for structural and functional differences. Results: After propensity score matching, 12 patients were included in each group. Patient demographics showed no significant differences. Analyses of MR imaging revealed no significant differences between COVID and control groups. Post-rehabilitation clinical assessments improved notably in both groups, however the intergroup analysis showed no significant difference. Conclusions: Previous COVID-19 infection did not affect brain structure or connectivity nor outcomes after rehabilitation.

N2  -  Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults. After the very narrow time frame during which treatment by thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is possible, cell therapy has huge potential for enhancing stroke recovery. Accurate analysis of the response to new therapy using imaging biomarkers is needed to assess therapeutic efficacy. The aim of this study was to compare 2 analysis techniques: the parametric response map (PRM), a voxel-based technique, and the standard whole-lesion approach. These 2 analyses were performed on data collected at 4 time points in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model, which was treated with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and vessel size index (VSI) were mapped using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two groups of rats received an intravenous injection of either 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-glutamine (MCAo-PBS, n = 10) or 3 million hMSCs (MCAo-hMSC, n = 10). One sham group was given PBS-glutamine (sham, n = 12). Each MRI parameter was analyzed by both the PRM and the whole-lesion approach. At day 9, 1 d after grafting, PRM revealed that hMSCs had reduced the fraction of decreased ADC (PRMADC_: MCAo-PBS 6.7% +/- 1.7% vs. MCAo-hMSC 3.3% +/- 2.4%), abolished the fraction of increased CBV (PRMCBV+_: MCAo-PBS 16.1% +/- 3.7% vs. MCAo-hMSC 6.4% +/- 2.6%), and delayed the fraction of increased VSI (PRMVSI+: MCAo-PBS 17.5% +/- 6.3% vs. MCAo-hMSC 5.4% +/- 2.6%). The whole-lesion approach was, however, insensitive to these early modifications. PRM thus appears to be a promising technique for the detection of early brain changes following treatments such as cell therapy.

N2  -  The brain connectivity-based atlas is a promising tool for understanding neural communication pathways in the brain, gaining relevance in predicting personalized outcomes for various brain pathologies. This critical review examines the robustness of the brain connectivity-based atlas for predicting post-stroke outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted from 2012 to May 2023 across PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, EBSCOhost, and Medline databases. Twenty-one studies were screened, and through analysis of these studies, we identified 18 brain connectivity atlases employed by the studies for lesion analysis in their predictions. The brain atlases were assessed for study cohorts, connectivity measures, identified brain regions, atlas applications, and limitations. Based on the analysis of these studies, most atlases were based on diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Studies predicting post-stroke functional outcomes relied on the atlases for multivariate lesion analysis and region of interest identification, often employing atlases derived from young, healthy populations. Current brain connectivity-based atlases for stroke applications lack standardized methods to define and map brain connectivity across atlases and cover sensorimotor functional connectivity to a limited extent. In conclusion, this review highlights the need to develop more comprehensive, robust, and adaptable brain connectivity-based atlases specifically tailored to post-stroke populations.

N2  -  This study proposed to investigate the optimal selection of b-values in diffusion-weighted imaging for distinguishing malignant from benign mediastinal lymph nodes. Diffusion-weighted imaging with six b-values was performed on 35 patients at 1.5 T. Image quality score, signal-to-noise ratio, and relative contrast ratio of lymph node to chest muscle were compared between the diffusion -weighted images with a b-value up to 800 and 1000 s/mm2. Using a lower and an upper b-value in the range of 0-1000 s/mm2, eight apparent diffusion coefficient maps were obtained from a mono-exponential model. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to evaluate the performance of the apparent diffusion coefficients for distinguishing malignant from benign mediastinal lymph nodes by using the area under the curve as a criterion.The mean image quality score and the relative contrast ratio showed no difference between b -values of 800 and 1000 s/mm2. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the areas under the curve of apparent diffusion coefficient with b-value pairs of (0, 800), (0, 1000), and (50, 800) s/mm2 were significantly higher than those from the other b-value pairs. No significant difference was observed among the three b-value pairs. Apparent diffusion coefficient obtained from b-value pairs of (0, 800), (0, 1000), and (50, 800) s/mm2 showed superior diagnostic performance compared to the other b-value combinations. Based on several practical considerations, the b -value pair of (50, 800) s/mm2 is recommended for differential diagnosis of mediastinal lymph nodes.

N2  -  Background Heterogeneity of gliomas challenges the neuronavigated biopsy and oncological therapy. Diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal the cellular and hemodynamic heterogeneity of tumors. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI is expected to be a non-invasive imaging approach to characterizing glioma. Purpose To evaluate the value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and spatially co-registered maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) for tissue characterization and glioma grading. Material and Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed gliomas were retrospectively investigated. The relative minimum ADC (rADC(min)), relative maximal ADC (rADC(max)), relative maximal rCBV (rCBV(max)), the relative minimum rCBV (rCBV(min)), and the corresponding relative SUVmax (rSUV(max)) were measured. The paired t-test was used to compare the quantitative parameters between different regions to clarify tumor heterogeneity. Imaging parameters between WHO grade IV and grade II/III gliomas were compared by t-test. The diagnostic efficiency of multiparametric PET/MRI was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The values of rSUV(max) were significantly different between maximal diffusion/perfusion area and minimum diffusion/perfusion area (P < 0.001/P < 0.001) within tumor. The values of rADC(min) (P < 0.001), rCBV(max) (P = 0.002), and corresponding rSUV(max) (P = 0.001/P < 0.001) could be used for grading gliomas. The areas under the ROC curves of rSUV(max) defined by rADC(min) and rCBV(max) were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. Conclusion Diffusion and perfusion MRI can detect glioma heterogeneity with excellent molecular imaging correlations. Regions with rCBV(max) suggest tissues with the highest metabolism and malignancy for guiding glioma grading and tissue sampling.

N2  -  Background: Understanding of sepsis-induced brain dysfunction remains poor, and relies mainly on data from animals or post-mortem studies in patients. The current study provided findings from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in septic shock. Methods: Nine patients with septic shock and brain dysfunction [7 women, median age 63 years (interquartile range 61-79 years), SAPS II: 48 (44-56), SOFA: 8 (6-10)] underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging including gradient echo T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted and diffusion isotropic images, and mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient. Results: Brain imaging was normal in two patients, showed multiple ischaemic strokes in two patients, and in the remaining patients showed white matter lesions at the level of the centrum semiovale, predominating around Virchow-Robin spaces, ranging from small multiple areas to diffuse lesions, and characterised by hyperintensity on FLAIR images. The main lesions were also characterised by reduced signal on diffusion isotropic images and increased apparent diffusion coefficient. The lesions of the white matter worsened with increasing duration of shock and were correlated with Glasgow Outcome Score. Conclusion: This preliminary study showed that sepsis-induced brain lesions can be documented by magnetic resonance imaging. These lesions predominated in the white matter, suggesting increasedblood-brain barrier permeability, and were associated with poor outcome.

N2  -  Purpose: The assessment of the radiological response of recurrent glioma is based on the Macdonald or RECIST criteria 8 to 10 weeks from the start of treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging using an apparent diffusion coefficient map may provide an earlier measure for predicting the response to therapy of recurrent glioma.
Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with recurrent high-grade glioma were enrolled in a feasibility study of pretreatment MRI on day 1, intra-treatment MRI in week 3, and post-treatment MRI in week 12. Prognostically relevant ADC values (ADCprog) of each recurrent glioma at 3 weeks were calculated as a function of their pre- and intra-therapy ADC values (ADCpre - ADCintra = ADCprog). Because we hypothesized that smaller ADC values correlate with less Brownian motion of water molecules in the extracellular space and that a higher cell density may restrain this water diffusion, we set smaller ADC values at a second time point as "progressive disease" (PD) and higher ADC values as "partial response" (PR). A change in ADCprog of less than 10 x 10(-6) mm(2)sec was set as "stable disease" (SD). The ADCprog values were always calculated before the final scan after 3 months was performed. The readers were blinded to the future development of the tumor.; Results: In 10 of the 12 patients we could correctly predict the tumor response to chemotherapy. One patient died before the three-month control, and one recurrent glioma did not develop as predicted. ADC mapping is found to predict patient response at 3 weeks from the start of treatment, revealing that early changes in tumor diffusion values could be used as a prognostic indicator also for chemotherapeutically treated recurrences of high-grade glioma.

N2  -  Entamoeba histolytica brain abscess is a rare clinical entity. Here we present a case with magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance perfusion imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings of a patient with pathologically proven E. Histolytica brain abscess. To our knowledge, these findings have not been described before in a patient with E. Histolytica brain abscess. MRI examination revealed multiple mass lesions with vasogenic edema and prominent contrast enhancement located at both gray and white matter of the right temporal, left parietooccipital, and bilateral frontal regions. T2-weighted images demonstrated hypointense foci within the lesions thought to be consistent with hemorrhage. Despite the large size and the radiologically aggressive appearance of the lesions, the gyral configuration seems to be relatively well preserved. DWI study revealed increased diffusion particularly in the central portion of the lesions. Perfusion imaging of the lesions demonstrated decreased perfusion compared with normal brain parenchyma. MRS examination of the left frontal lesion showed decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) ratio, and increased Cho/creatine (Cr) ratio at the peripheral thick enhancing rim. A resonance peak for Cho (3.2 ppm), lipid (1.2 ppm), and negative lactate (1.3 ppm) was detected at the central non-enhancing part of the frontal mass lesion. Nearly all patients with amebic intracranial abscess reported in the medical literature died despite aggressive medical and surgical treatment. It is likely that intense pharmacologic treatment or early neurosurgical intervention in single lesions may be life-saving in these patients and late diagnosis may be a contributory factor in the high mortality rate. Although it is not at the top of the differential diagnosis list, we think that amebic encephalitis must be entertained in a patient with ancillary radiological and clinical findings.

N2  -  Purpose
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to differentiate glioblastoma (GBM) from brain metastasis.; Materials and Methods; The institutional review board of our hospital approved this retrospective study. The study population consisted of 128 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection and were diagnosed as either GBM (n = 89) or brain metastasis (n = 39). All participants underwent preoperative MR imaging including ASL. For qualitative analysis, the tumors were visually graded into five categories based on ASL-CBF maps by two blinded reviewers. For quantitative analysis, the reviewers drew regions of interest (ROIs) on ASL-CBF maps upon the most hyperperfused portion within the tumor and upon peritumoral T2 hyperintensity area. Signal intensities of intratumoral and peritumoral ROIs for each subject were normalized by dividing the values by those of contralateral normal gray matter (nCBF(intratumoral) and nCBF(peritumoral), respectively). Visual grading scales and quantitative parameters between GBM and brain metastasis were compared. In addition, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ASL-driven CBF to differentiate GBM from brain metastasis.; Results; For qualitative analysis, GBM group showed significantly higher grade compared to metastasis group (p = 0.001). For quantitative analysis, both nCB(Fintratumoral) and nCBF(peritumoral) in GBM were significantly higher than those in metastasis (both p < 0.001). The areas under the curve were 0.677, 0.714, and 0.835 for visual grading, nCBF(intratumoral), and nCBF(peritumoral), respectively (all p < 0.001).; Conclusion; ASL perfusion MR imaging can aid in the differentiation of GBM from brain metastasis.
