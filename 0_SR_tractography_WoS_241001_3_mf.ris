N2  -  The neocortices of 10 patients with partial seizures and acquired lesions, 14 patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and 33 patients with partial seizures and normal conventional MRI were quantitatively evaluated using whole brain double inversion recovery imaging (DIR) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).
Compared to a group of 30 control subjects, DIR and objective voxel-by-voxel statistical comparison identified regions of significantly abnormal DIR signal intensity (DSI) in 9 out of 10 patients with acquired nonprogressive cerebral lesions and partial seizures. In all 9 patients, the areas of abnormal DSI concurred with abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI. In all 14 patients with MCD, SPM detected regions of significantly abnormal DSI; all of which corresponded to abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI. In addition, in both groups, there were areas that were normal on conventional imaging, which demonstrated abnormal DSI. Voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis identified significantly abnormal DSI in 15 of the 33 patients with cryptogenic focal epilepsy. In 10 of these, the areas of abnormal DSI concurred with epileptic EEG abnormality and clinical seizure semiology. Group analysis of MRI-negative patients with electroclinical seizure onset localising to the left temporal and left and right frontal regions revealed significantly abnormal DSI within the white matter of each respective lobe.; DIR analysed using SPM was sensitive in patients with MCDs and acquired cerebral damage. Significant abnormalities in DSI in individual and grouped MRI-negative patients suggest that occult epileptogenic cerebral lesions are associated with subtle structural abnormalities. DIR is, therefore, a useful quantitative MRI technique for characterising epileptic foci and may contribute to presurgical evaluation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine whether magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is influenced by genetic and cellular features of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) aggressiveness.
Materials and Methods: In this HIPAA-compliant institutional review board approved study, multiple enhancing and peritumoral non-enhancing stereotactic neurosurgical biopsy samples from treatment-naive GBMs were collected prospectively, with guidance from cerebral blood volume (CBV) MR imaging measurements. By using monoclonal antibodies, tissue specimens were examined for microvascular expression, hypoxia, tumor and overall cellular density, and histopathologic features of GBM aggressiveness. Genetic expression patterns were investigated with RNA microarrays. Imaging and histopathologic variables were compared with the Welch t test and Pearson correlations. Microarray analysis was performed by using false discovery rate (FDR) statistics.; Results: Tumor biopsy of 13 adult patients yielded 16 enhancing and 14 peritumoral nonenhancing specimens. Enhancing regions had elevated relative CBV and reduced relative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements compared with peritumoral nonenhancing biopsy regions (P < .01). A positive correlation was found between relative CBV and all histopathologic features of aggressiveness (P < .04). An inverse correlation was found between relative ADC and all histopathologic features of aggressiveness (P < .05). RNA expression patterns between tumor regions were found to be significantly different (FDR < 0.05), with hierarchical clustering by biopsy region only.; Conclusion: These findings suggest MR imaging is significantly influenced by GBM genetic and cellular biologic features of aggressiveness and imply physiologic MR imaging may be useful in pinpointing regions of highest malignancy within heterogeneous tissues, thus facilitating histologic grading of primary glial brain tumors.

N2  -  Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is an emerging tool for surgery of motor-eloquent intrinsic brain tumors, but a critical reappraisal of the literature evidence has never been performed, so far. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed searching on PubMed/MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies that analyzed the impact of nTMS-based motor mapping on surgery of patients affected by motor-eloquent intrinsic brain tumors, in comparison with series of patients operated without using nTMS. The impact of nTMS mapping was assessed analyzing the occurrence of postoperative new permanent motor deficits, the gross total resection rate (GTR), the size of craniotomy and the length of surgery. Only eight studies were considered eligible and were included in the quantitative review and meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that nTMS motor mapping significantly reduced the risk of postoperative new permanent motor deficits (OR = 0.54, p = 0.001, data available from eight studies) and increased the GTR rate (OR = 2.32, p < 0.001, data from seven studies). Moreover, data from four studies documented the craniotomy size was reduced in the nTMS group (-6.24 cm(2), p < 0.001), whereas a trend towards a reduction, even if non significant, was observed for the length of surgery (-10.30 min, p = 0.38) in three studies. Collectively, currently available literature provides data in favor of the use of nTMS motor mapping: its use seems to be associated with a reduced occurrence of postoperative permanent motor deficits, an increased GTR rate, and a tailored surgical approach compared to standard surgery without using preoperative nTMS mapping. Nonetheless, a growing need of high-level evidence about the use of nTMS motor mapping in brain tumor surgery is perceived. Well designed randomized controlled studies from multiple Institutions are clearly advocated to continue to shed a light on this emerging topic.

N2  -  Stereotactic biopsy is used to enable diagnostic confirmation of brain tumors and treatment planning. Despite being a well-established technique, it is related to significant morbidity and mortality rates mostly caused by hemorrhages due to blood vessel ruptures.
This paper presents a method of vessel detection during stereotactic biopsy that can be easily implemented by integrating two side-view fibers into a conventional sidecutting biopsy needle. Tissue within the needle window is illuminated through the first fiber; the second fiber detects the remitted light. By taking the ratio of the intensities at two wavelengths with strongly differing hemoglobin absorption, blood vessels can be recognized immediately before biopsy sampling.; Via ray tracing simulations and phantom experiments, the dependency of the remission ratio R = I578I650 on various parameters (blood oxygenation, fiber-to-vessel and inter-fiber distance, vessel diameter and orientation) was investigated for a bare-fiber probe. Up to 800-1200 mu m away from the probe, a vessel can be recognized by a considerable reduction of the remission ratio from the background level. The technique was also successfully tested with a real biopsy needle probe on both optical phantoms and ex-vivo porcine brain tissue, thus showing potential to improve the safety of stereotactic biopsy.; Dual-wavelength remission measurement for the detection of blood vessels during stereotactic biopsy.; GRAPHICS; .

N2  -  Purpose The purpose of this study was to differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from primary central nervous system lymphoma using the customised first and second-order histogram features derived from apparent diffusion coefficients. Methods and materials:A total of 82 patients (57 with glioblastoma multiforme and 25 with primary central nervous system lymphoma) were included in this study. The axial T1 post-contrast and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images were used to delineate regions of interest for the tumour and peritumoral oedema. The regions of interest were then co-registered with the apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and the first and second-order histogram features were extracted and compared between glioblastoma multiforme and primary central nervous system lymphoma groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to calculate a cut-off value and its sensitivity and specificity to differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from primary central nervous system lymphoma. Results Based on the tumour regions of interest, apparent diffusion coefficient mean, maximum, median, uniformity and entropy were higher in the glioblastoma multiforme group than the primary central nervous system lymphoma group (P <= 0.001). The most sensitive first and second-order histogram feature to differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from primary central nervous system lymphoma was the maximum of 2.026 or less (95% confidence interval (CI) 75.1-99.9%), and the most specific first and second-order histogram feature was smoothness of 1.28 or greater (84.0% CI 70.9-92.8%). Based on the oedema regions of interest, most of the first and second-order histogram features were higher in the glioblastoma multiforme group compared to the primary central nervous system lymphoma group (P <= 0.015). The most sensitive first and second-order histogram feature to differentiate glioblastoma multiforme from primary central nervous system lymphoma was the 25th percentile of 0.675 or less (100% CI 83.2-100%) and the most specific first and second-order histogram feature was the median of 1.28 or less (85.9% CI 66.3-95.8%). Conclusions Texture analysis using first and second-order histogram features derived from apparent diffusion coefficient maps may be helpful in differentiating glioblastoma multiforme from primary central nervous system lymphoma.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging is increasingly available for brain investigation. Image interpretation of intracranial space-occupying lesions often includes the derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analysis. In human medicine, ADC can help discriminate between benign and malignant lesions in intracranial tumors. This study investigates the difference in ADC values depending on the sample strategies of image analysis. MRI examination, including diffusion-weighted images of canine and feline patients presented between 2015 and 2020, were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with single, large intracranial space-occupying lesions were included. Lesions homogeneity was subjectively scored. ADC values were calculated using six different methods of sampling (M1-M6) on the ADC map. M1 included as much as possible of the lesion on a maximum of five consecutive slices; M2 included five central and five peripheral ROIs; M3 included a single ROI on the solid part of the lesion; M4 included three central ROIs on one slice; M5 included three central ROIs on different slices; and M6 included one large ROI on the entire lesion. A total of 201 animals of various breeds, genders, and ages were analyzed. ADC values differed significantly between M5 against M2 (peripheral) (p < 0.001), M5 against M6 (p = 0.009), and M4 against M2 (peripheral) (p = 0.005). When lesions scored as homogeneous in all sequences were excluded, an additional significant difference in three further sampling methods was present (p < 0.005). ADC of single, large, intracranial space-occupying lesions differed significantly in half of the tested methods of sampling. Excluding homogeneous lesions, additional significant differences among the sampling methods were present. The obtained results should increase awareness of the variability of the ADC, depending on the sample strategies used.

N2  -  Reactive microgliosis is an important pathological component of neuroinflammation and has been implicated in a wide range of brain diseases including brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. Mapping reactive microglia in-vivo is often performed with PET scanning whose resolution, cost, and availability prevent its widespread use. The advent of diffusion compartment imaging (DCI) to probe tissue microstructure in vivo holds promise to map reactive microglia using MRI scanners. But this potential has never been demonstrated. In this paper, we performed longitudinal DCI in rats that underwent dorsal root axotomy triggering Wallerian degeneration of axons-a pathological process which reliably activates microglia. After the last DCI at 51 days, rats were sacrificed and histology with Iba-1 immunostaining for microglia was performed. The fraction of extra-axonal restricted diffusion from DCI was found to follow the expected temporal dynamics of reactive microgliosis. Furthermore, a strong and significant correlation between this parameter and histological measurement of microglial density was observed. These findings strongly suggest that extra-axonal restricted diffusion is an in-vivo marker of reactive microglia. They pave the way for MRI-based microglial mapping which may be important to characterize the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

N2  -  Objective To evaluate the feasibility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) in assessing blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and microvasculature in tumoral tissue of glioma patients. Methods Images from 8 high-grade and 4 low-grade glioma patients were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. Acquisition protocol included pre- and post-contrast T1- and T2-weighted imaging, FLAIR, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). In addition, IVIM was acquired with 15 b-values and fitted under the non-negative least square (NNLS) model to output the diffusion (D) and pseudo-diffusion (D*) coefficients, perfusion fraction (f), and f times D* (fD*) maps. Results IVIM perfusion-related maps were sensitive to (1) blood flow and perfusion alterations within the microvasculature of brain tumors, in agreement with intra-tumoral susceptibility signal (ITSS); (2) enhancing areas of BBB breakdown in agreement with DSC maps as well as areas of BBB abnormality that was not detected on DSC maps; (3) enhancing perfusion changes within edemas; (4) detecting early foci of increased perfusion within low-grade gliomas. Conclusion The results suggest IVIM may be a promising approach to delineate tumor extension and progression in size, and to predict histological grade, which are clinically relevant information that characterize tumors and guide therapeutic decisions in patients with glioma.

N2  -  There is a need for biomarkers that are useful for noninvasive imaging of tumor pathophysiology and drug efficacy. Through its use of endogenous water, diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) can be used to probe local tissue architecture and structure. However, most DW-MRI studies of cancer tissues have relied on simplistic mathematical models, such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) models, which produce equivocal results on the relation of the model parameter estimate with the underlying tissue microstructure. Here, we present a novel technique called VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors) to quantify and map histologic features of tumors in vivo. VERDICT couples DW-MRI to a mathematical model of tumor tissue to access features such as cell size, vascular volume fraction, intra-and extracellular volume fractions, and pseudo-diffusivity associated with blood flow. To illustrate VERDICT, we used two tumor xenograft models of colorectal cancer with different cellular and vascular phenotypes. Our experiments visualized known differences in the tissue microstructure of each model and the significant decrease in cell volume resulting from administration of the cytotoxic drug gemcitabine, reflecting the apoptotic volume decrease. In contrast, the standard ADC and IVIM models failed to detect either of these differences. Our results illustrate the superior features of VERDICT for cancer imaging, establishing it as a noninvasive method to monitor and stratify treatment responses. (C)2014 AACR.

N2  -  Our aim was to evaluate the link between diffusion parameters measured by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the perfusion metrics obtained with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in soft tissue tumors (STTs). Twenty-eight patients affected by histopathologically confirmed STT were included in a prospective study. All patients underwent both DCE MRI and IVIM DWI. The perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D and perfusion-related diffusion coefficient D* were estimated using a bi-exponential function to fit the DWI data. DCE MRI was acquired with a temporal resolution of 3-5s. Maps of the initial area under the gadolinium concentration curve (IAUGC), time to peak (TTP) and maximum slope of increase (MSI) were derived using commercial software. The relationships between the DCE MRI and IVIM DWI measurements were assessed by Spearman's test. To exclude false positive results under multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was applied. The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences between all variables in patients with non-myxoid and myxoid STT. No significant relationship was found between IVIM parameters and any DCE MRI parameters. Higher f and D*f values were found in non-myxoid tumors compared with myxoid tumors (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively). MSI was significantly higher in non-myxoid tumors than in myxoid tumors (p=0.029). From the visual assessments of single clinical cases, both f and D*f maps were in satisfactory agreement with DCE maps in the extreme cases of an avascular mass and a highly vascularized mass, whereas, for tumors with slight vascularity or with a highly heterogeneous perfusion pattern, this association was not straightforward. Although IVIM DWI was demonstrated to be feasible in STT, our data did not support evident relationships between perfusion-related IVIM parameters and perfusion measured by DCE MRI.

N2  -  Purpose: A noninvasive diagnostic method to predict the degree of malignancy accurately would be of great help in glioma management. This study aimed to create a highly accurate machine learning model to perform glioma grading.
Methods and Materials: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging acquired for cases of glioma operated on at our institution from October 2014 through January 2018 were obtained retrospectively. Six types of magnetic resonance imaging sequences (T-2-weighted image, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient ADC, fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis MK) were chosen for analysis; 476 features were extracted semiautomatically for each sequence (2856 features in total). Recursive feature elimination was used to select significant features for a machine learning model that distinguishes glioblastoma from lower-grade glioma (grades 2 and 3).; Results: Fifty-five data sets from 54 cases were obtained (14 grade 2 gliomas, 12 grade 3 gliomas, and 29 glioblastomas), of which 44 and 11 data sets were used for machine learning and independent testing, respectively. We detected 504 features with significant differences (false discovery rate <0.05) between glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma. The most accurate machine learning model was created using 6 features extracted from the ADC and MK images. In the logistic regression, the area under the curve was 0.90 +- 0.05, and the accuracy of the test data set was 0.91 (10 out of 11); using a support vector machine, they were 0.93 +- 0.03 and 0.91 (10 out of 11), respectively (kernel, radial basis function; c = 1.0).; Conclusions: Our machine learning model accurately predicted glioma tumor grade. The ADC and MK sequences produced particularly useful features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Diffusion restriction is the morphologic hallmark of acute ischemic infarcts and excitotoxic brain injury in various cerebral pathologies. Diffusion restriction is visible as hyperintensity on DWI and as hypointensity on ADC maps. Due to the vicinity of multiple anatomic structures in the brain stem and hippocampus, very small lesions with diffusion restriction may result in severe clinical symptomatology, but these small lesions easily go undetected on standard cerebral DWI due to insufficient spatial resolution, T2* blurring, and image artifacts caused by susceptibility-related image distortions. Diffusion-weighted zonal oblique multislice-EPI with reduced FOV acquisition permits a considerable increase in spatial resolution and enhances the visualization of very small pathologic lesions in the brain stem and hippocampus. Improved performance in the depiction of different pathologic lesions with diffusion restriction in the brain stem and hippocampus using this sequence compared with standard DWI in selected cases is presented.

N2  -  We present the histologic study of two patients who underwent cerebral cortex resection for partial seizures linked with cortical dysplasia. The distinction of areas of seizure origin from areas of seizure propagation was made according to stereoelectroencephalographic criteria. Samples of epileptogenic tissue were studied by using cytoarchitectonic and immunohistochemical stainings. We mapped the catecholaminergic afferents by employing antisera directed against tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase enzymes. The epileptic activity was correlated with the underlying patterns of cytoarchitectonic' and immunohistochemical changes. The neuropathological features were focal and consisted of large neurons dispersed through all but the first cortical layer (associated in one case to giant glial cells), of variable disturbance of lamination, of neuronal ectopia in the white matter and of moderate proliferation of small glial cells. Areas of seizure onset coincided with that of dysplastic zones. Both laminar distribution and density of catecholaminergic fibers were altered in the dysplastic cortices (area of seizure onset) and there was an increase in the density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers in the surrounding areas of seizure propagation. Our results indicate that these developmental epileptogenic lesions were associated with abnormal neuronal circuitry. They provide evidence at the structural level of the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity previously reported in spiking areas of human epileptogenic cerebral cortex and they suggest that catecholamines may contribute toward limiting seizure activity propagation.

T2  -  MINIMALLY INVASIVE NEUROSURGERY

N2  -  Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the usefulness of recent advances of neuronavigational technology in the management of skull base tumors and of vascular lesions, treated via a skull base approach. Methods: In 16 patients (skull base meningioma n = 9, petrous apex epidermoid n = 1, craniopharyngeoma n = 1, giant internal carotid artery aneurysm n = 1, basilar/ vertebral artery aneurysm n = 2, brain stem cavernoma n = 2), "advanced" neuronavigation was used. In contrast to "conventional" neuronavigation, the information for the neurosurgeon was enhanced by the intraoperative screen display of 3-dimensional reconstructions of the lesion, vessels, nerves and fiber tracts at risk. The 3-dimensional reconstructions were obtained by preoperative manual or automated segmentation processes. In addition, different imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT] with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], CF with Cr angiography, T-1- with diffusion-weighted MRI) were fused and shown on the screen. Results: In the cases of tumors, "advanced" neuronavigation facilitated the approach (n = 4), contributed to tailor the approach (n = 2) and helped to identify hidden neurovascular structures (n = 9). In the cases of aneurysms, "advanced" neuronavigation allowed us to reduce the skull base approach to the needs of safe aneurysm clipping (n = 3). In both cases of brain stem cavernoma, "advanced" neuronavigation was deemed useful for definition of the best surgical approach in relation to the pyramidal tract and brain stem nuclei. Conclusion: The authors' experiences suggest that neuronavigation, which displays 3-dimensional reconstructions of lesion, vessels, nerves and fiber tracts during surgery and makes use of image fusion techniques, is an important tool in the neurosurgical management of skull base lesions.

N2  -  PurposeTo assess brain damage in a rat model of cerebral ischemia based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) data obtained from multi-high b-values and evaluate the relationship between Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression and ADC. MethodsThirty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups: (1) sham controls (n = 6) and (2) cerebral ischemia (successful model, n = 19). All rats underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with both standard b-values and multi-high b-values (2,500-4,500 s/mm(2)) using a 3.0-T device. Standard ADC (ADC(st)) maps and multi-high b-value ADCs (ADC(mh)) were calculated, respectively. Aquaporin 4 expression was quantified using Western blot. Relative values of ADC(st) and ADC(mh), AQP4 expression were compared between the sham group and the ischemia group. Correlations between ADC values and AQP4 expression were evaluated. ResultsAt 0.5 h after suture insertion, the value of ADC(mh) on the lesion was obviously decreased, and there was no difference in lesion volume when compared with ADC(st). After reperfusion, besides similar regions where ADC(st) values decreased, we also found additional large values on ADC(mh) within the cortex of the ipsilateral side or surrounding the lesion. The lesion evolution of the large value on ADC(mh) was quite different from other indicators. But the total ADC(mh) values were still significantly associated with ADC(st). The AQP4 protein expression level was appreciably increased after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), but there was no correlation between AQP4 expression either with ADC(mh) or ADC(st). ConclusionWe found the large values on ADC(mh) during the progression of cerebral infarction is varied, but there was no correlation between ADC(mh) values and AQP4 expression. ADC(mh) may indicate the heterogeneity of ischemia lesions, but the underlying pathological basis should be further explored.

N2  -  ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to clarify characteristics of post-encephalopathic epilepsy (PEE) in children after acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD), paying particular attention to precise diagnosis of seizure types.
MethodsAmong 262 children with acute encephalopathyencephalitis registered in a database of the Tokai Pediatric Neurology Society between 2005 and 2012, 44 were diagnosed with AESD according to the clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and were included in this study. Medical records were reviewed to investigate clinical data, MRI findings, neurologic outcomes, and presence or absence of PEE. Seizure types of PEE were determined by both clinical observation by pediatric neurologists and ictal video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.; ResultsOf the 44 patients after AESD, 10 (23%) had PEE. The period between the onset of encephalopathy and PEE ranged from 2 to 39months (median 8.5months). Cognitive impairment was more severe in patients with PEE than in those without. Biphasic seizures and status epilepticus during the acute phase of encephalopathy did not influence the risk of PEE. The most common seizure type of PEE on clinical observation was focal seizures (n=5), followed by epileptic spasms (n=4), myoclonic seizures (n=3), and tonic seizures (n=2). In six patients with PEE, seizures were induced by sudden unexpected sounds. Seizure types confirmed by ictal video-EEG recordings were epileptic spasms and focal seizures with frontal onset, and all focal seizures were startle seizures induced by sudden acoustic stimulation. Intractable daily seizures remain in six patients with PEE.; SignificanceWe demonstrate seizure characteristics of PEE in children after AESD. Epileptic spasms and startle focal seizures are common seizure types. The specific seizure types may be determined by the pattern of diffuse subcortical white matter injury in AESD and age-dependent reorganization of the brain network.

T2  -  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY

N2  -  Background: Synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) is a fast, standardized, and robust novel quantitative technique that has the potential to circumvent the subjectivity of interpretation in prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and the limitations of existing MRI quantification techniques. Our study aimed to evaluate the potential utility of SyMRI in the diagnosis and aggressiveness assessment of prostate cancer (PCA). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 309 patients with suspected PCA who had undergone mpMRI and SyMRI, and pathologic results were obtained by biopsy or PCA radical prostatectomy (RP). Pathological types were classified as PCA, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or peripheral zone (PZ) inflammation. According to the Gleason Score (GS), PCA was divided into groups of intermediate-to-high risk (GS >= 4+3) and low-risk (GS <= 3+4). Patients with biopsy-confirmed low-risk PCA were further divided into upgraded and nonupgraded groups based on the GS changes of the RP results. The values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T1, T2 and proton density (PD) of these lesions were measured on ADC and SyMRI parameter maps by two physicians; these values were compared between PCA and BPH or inflammation, between the intermediate-to-high-risk and low-risk PCA groups, and between the upgraded and nonupgraded PCA groups. The risk factors affecting GS grades were identified via univariate analysis. The effects of confounding factors were excluded through multivariate logistic regression analysis, and independent predictive factors were calculated. Subsequently, the ADC+Sy(T2+PD) combined models for predicting PCA risk grade or GS upgrade were constructed through data processing analysis. The diagnostic performance of each parameter and the ADC+Sy(T2+PD) model was analyzed. The calibration curve was calculated by the bootstrapping internal validation method (200 bootstrap resamples). Results: The T1, T2, and PD values of PCA were significantly lower than those of BPH or inflammation (P <= 0.001) in both the PZ or transitional zone. Among the 178 patients with PCA, intermediate-to-high-risk PCA group had significantly higher T1, T2, and PD values but lower ADC values compared with the low-risk group (P<0.05), and the diagnostic efficacy of each single parameter was similar (P>0.05). The ADC+Sy(T2+PD) model showed the best performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) 0.110 [AUC =0.818; 95% confidence interval the 68 patients initially classified as PCA in the low-risk group by biopsy, PCA in the postoperative upgraded GS group had significantly higher T1, T2, and PD values but lower ADC values than did those in the nonupgraded group (P<0.01). In addition, the ADC+Sy(T2+PD) model better predicted the upgrade of GS, with a significant increase in AUC of 0.204 (AUC =0.947; 95% CI: 0.864-0.987) compared with ADC alone (AUC =0.743; 95% CI: 0.622-0.841) (P<0.001). Conclusions: Quantitative parameters (T1, T2, and PD) derived from SyMRI can help differentiate PCA from non-PCA. Combining SyMRI parameters with ADC significantly improved the ability to differentiate between intermediate-to-high risk PCA from low-risk PCA and could predict the upgrade of low-risk PCA as confirmed by biopsy.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes in the penumbra.
METHODS: We determined core and perfusion lesions in subjects from the WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) and AXIS 2 trial (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke) with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging at baseline. Only subjects with a mismatch volume >15 mL and ratio >1.2 were included. We created voxel-based relative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity (rFLAIR SI) maps at baseline and follow-up. We studied rFLAIR SI in 2 regions of interest: baseline penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-core lesion+voxels with apparent diffusion coefficient <620 10(-6) mm(2)s) and noninfarcted penumbra (baseline perfusion lesion-follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion) at 24 hours (WAKE-UP) or 30 days (AXIS 2). We analyzed the association between rFLAIR SI and severity of hypoperfusion, defined as time to maximum of the residue function.; RESULTS: In the baseline penumbra, rFLAIR SI was elevated (ratio, 1.04; P=1.7x10(-13); n=126) and correlated with severity of hypoperfusion (Pearson r, 0.03; P<1.0x10(-4); n=126). In WAKE-UP, imaging at 24 hours revealed a further increase of rFLAIR SI in the noninfarcted penumbra (ratio, 1.05 at 24 hours versus 1.03 at baseline; P=7.1x10(-3); n=43). In AXIS 2, imaging at 30 days identified reversibility of the rFLAIR SI (ratio, 1.02 at 30 days versus 1.04 at baseline; P=1.5x10(-3); n=26) since it was no longer different from 1 (ratio, 1.01 at 30 days; P=0.099; n=26).; CONCLUSIONS: Penumbral rFLAIR SI increases appear early after stroke onset, correlate with severity of hypoperfusion, further increase at 24 hours, and are reversible by 30 days.

N2  -  Histochromatography permits a more exact quantitative and qualitative estimation of phospholipids in normal and pathological areas in the central nervous system. Samples of brain tumors and of normal cerebral tissues obtained during neurosurgical intervention were also tested. The method allows the demonstration of the difference in the chromatographic distribution of single phospholipids found in various tumors, from ectodermal or mesodermal origin. Further data were obtained with direct chromatography of homogenated brain tissues. A new modification consisting of the combination of the Sudan Black B technique for bound lipids and the periodic acid Schiff reaction allows identification of some tissue structure (Rosenthal fibers, microglia cells etc.) in some tumors.

N2  -  Introduction MRI has been increasingly used in radiation therapy to facilitate tumor and organ delineation and assess treatment response. Diffusion MRI can provide cellularity information and may enable functional-based treatment planning and adaptation. However, strong distortion associated with the conventional diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging (DW-ssEPI) sequence is problematic for accurate target delineation. The goal of this work is to propose a 3D diffusion sequence with minimal distortion for radiation therapy applications.
Methods A 3D diffusion-prepared magnitude-stabilized balanced steady-state free precession sequence (DP-MS-bSSFP) was developed. A 2D navigator was acquired during the linear catalyzation stage of the bSSFP readout to estimate the phase, which was then used in a plane-by-plane low-rank constrained reconstruction to correct the shot-to-shot k-space inconsistency. A diffusion phantom was scanned to evaluate and compare the geometric reliability and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) accuracy with the conventional DW-ssEPI. Eight landmarks were selected on each slice of the images to calculate the target registration error (TRE), which was used as a surrogate for geometric fidelity. The phantom was scanned under both 0celcius and room temperature. Brain scans were performed on five healthy volunteers. In the first volunteer, protocols of 1, 2, and 4 shots per Kz plane were compared. In vivo geometric fidelity and ADC accuracy were evaluated on the remaining four volunteers using the protocol of four shots per Kz plane. In the geometric fidelity study, 8-10 landmarks were picked on each slice to calculate the TRE. Regions of interest were placed on the white matter, the cerebellum, and the cerebrospinal fluid region to evaluate the ADC agreement between DW-ssEPI and DP-MS using the Bland-Altman plot. All scans were performed at 1.5 mm isotropic resolution to meet the high-resolution requirement of many radiotherapy applications.; Results The DP-MS had drastically improved geometric accuracy compared with DW-ssEPI on the phantom. The mean TRE decreased from 2.09 mm to 0.70 mm. The percentage difference of the ADC values between the two diffusion sequences were less than 5.5% and 7% for the 0celcius and room temperature study, respectively. The DW-ssEPI had strong distortion and susceptibility-related artifacts at tissue air boundary, whereas distortion was minimal in DP-MS images. Overall, the meanmax TRE was over 2 mm7 mm in the volunteers for DW-ssEPI, whereas less than 0.8 mm2 mm for DP-MS. Good ADC agreement was observed for the white matter, the cerebellum, and the CSF based on the Bland-Altman plots.; Conclusion A 3D diffusion sequence was developed and validated. It provided high-resolution diffusion imaging with mean distortion less than 1 mm at 1.5 T, and is a promising imaging technique for treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy.

T2  -  EPILEPSIA

N2  -  Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of medically intractable partial epilepsy amenable to surgery. In the majority of cases, the underlying pathology in temporal lobe epilepsy is mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Whereas historically invasive recordings were required for most epilepsy surgeries, indications have dramatically changed since the introduction of high-resolution MRI, which uncovers structural lesions in a high percentage of cases. No invasive recordings are required to perform a temporal lobectomy in patients with intractable epilepsy who have structural imaging suggesting unilateral MTS and concordant interictal and ictal surface EEG recordings, functional imaging, and clinical Findings. Invasive testing is needed if there is evidence of bitemporal MTS on structural imaging and/or electrophysiologically, and additional information from functional imaging, neuropsychology, and the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test also does not help to lateralize the epileptogenic zone. Depth electrodes can be particularly helpful in this setting. However, no surgery is indicated, even without invasive recordings, if bitemporal-independent seizures are recorded by surface EEG and all additional testing is inconclusive. Other etiologies of TLE such as a tumor, vascular malformation, encephalomalacia, or congenital developmental abnormality account for about 30% of all patients who undergo epilepsy surgery. Epilepsy surgery is indicated after limited electrophysiologic investigations if neuroimaging and electrophysiology converge. However, approaches for resection in lesional temporal lobe epilepsy vary among centers. Completeness of resection is crucial and invasive recordings may be needed to guide the resection by mapping eloquent cortex and/or to determine the extent of the non-MRI-visible epileptogenic area. Specific approaches for the different pathologies are discussed because there is evidence that the relationship between the lesions visible on MRI and the epileptogenic zone varies among lesions of different pathologies, and therefore variable surgical strategies must be applied.

N2  -  Purpose: Currently, radiologic response of brain tumors is assessed according to the Macdonald criteria 10 weeks from the start of therapy. There exists a critical need to identify nonresponding patients early in the course of their therapy for consideration of alternative treatment strategies. Our study assessed the effectiveness of the parametric response map (PRM) imaging biomarker to provide for an earlier measure of patient survival prediction.
Experimental Design: Forty-five high-grade glioma patients received concurrent chemoradiation. Quantitative MRI including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were acquired pretreatment and 3 weeks midtreatment on a prospective institutional-approved study. PRM, a voxel-by-voxel image analysis method, was evaluated as an early prognostic biomarker of overall survival. Clinical and conventional MR parameters were also evaluated.; Results: Multivariate analysis showed that PRMADC+ in combination with PRMrCBV- obtained at week 3 had a stronger correlation to 1-year and overall survival rates than any baseline clinical or treatment response imaging metric. The composite biomarker identified three distinct patient groups, nonresponders median survival (MS) of 5.5 months, 95% CI: 4.4-6.6 months, partial responders (MS of 16 months, 95% CI: 8.6-23.4 months), and responders (MS has not yet been reached).; Conclusions: Inclusion of PRMADC+ and PRMrCBV- into a single imaging biomarker metric provided early identification of patients resistant to standard chemoradiation. In comparison to the current standard of assessment of response at 10 weeks (Macdonald criteria), the composite PRM biomarker potentially provides a useful opportunity for clinicians to identify patients who may benefit from alternative treatment strategies.

N2  -  We introduce the STEAMDTI analysis engine: a whole brain voxel-based analysis technique for the examination of diffusion tensor images (DTIs). Our STEAM analysis technique consists of two parts. First, we introduce a collection of statistical templates that represent the distribution of DTIs for a normative population. These templates include various diffusionmeasures from the full tensor, to fractional anisotropy, to 12 other tensor features. Second, we propose a voxel-based analysis (VBA) pipeline that is reliable enough to identify areas in individual DTI scans that differ significantly from the normative group represented in the STEAM statistical templates. We identify and justify choices in the VBA pipeline relating to multiple comparison correction, image smoothing, and dealing with non-normally distributed data. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for the utility of STEAM on a cohort of 134 very preterm infants. We generated templates from scans of 55 very preterm infants whose T1 MRI scans show no abnormalities and who have normal neurodevelopmental outcome. The remaining 79 infants were then compared to the templates using our VBA technique. We show: (a) that our statistical templates display the white matter development expected over the modeled time period, and (b) that our VBA results detect abnormalities in the diffusion measurements that relate significantly with both the presence of white matter lesions and with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. Most notably, we show that STEAM produces personalized results while also being able to highlight abnormalities across the whole brain and at the scale of individual voxels. While we show the value of STEAM on DTI scans from a preterm infant cohort, STEAM can be equally applied to other cohorts as well. To facilitate this whole-brain personalized DTI analysis, we made STEAM publicly available at http://www.sfu.ca/bgb2/steam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  An 11-year-old boy with an atypical form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is reported predominantly involving the frontal lobes, and later spreading to temporal lobes. Magnetization transfer contrast T1-weighted, and FLAIR images without intravenous paramagnetic contrast medium, clearly identified the leading edge of a central necrotic zone, as well as a splenial lesion. Zonal differences were identified on ADC maps of an echo-planar diffusion MRI sequence that the ADC value of central zone (2.06 X 10(-3) mm(2)/sec) was higher than that of the peripheral zone (1.67 X 10(-3) mm(2) /sec). On proton spectroscopy, besides changes in the peaks of NAA, choline, and myoinositol, prominent peaks between 0.9 and 1.4 ppm were shown belonging to macromolecules, probably to very long chain fatty acids, a diagnostic feature of adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition, a distinct and prominent glycine peak was observed at 3.50 ppm, reflecting excitotoxic brain damage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  For over a century, neuroscientists have been working toward parcellating the human cortex into distinct neurobiological regions. Modern technologies offer many parcellation methods for healthy cortices acquired through magnetic resonance imaging. However, these methods are suboptimal for personalized neurosurgical application given that pathology and resection distort the cerebrum. We sought to overcome this problem by developing a novel connectivity-based parcellation approach that can be applied at the single-subject level. Utilizing normative diffusion data, we first developed a machine-learning (ML) classifier to learn the typical structural connectivity patterns of healthy subjects. Specifically, the Glasser HCP atlas was utilized as a prior to calculate the streamline connectivity between each voxel and each parcel of the atlas. Using the resultant feature vector, we determined the parcel identity of each voxel in neurosurgical patients (n = 40) and thereby iteratively adjusted the prior. This approach enabled us to create patient-specific maps independent of brain shape and pathological distortion. The supervised ML classifier re-parcellated an average of 2.65% of cortical voxels across a healthy dataset (n = 178) and an average of 5.5% in neurosurgical patients. Our patient dataset consisted of subjects with supratentorial infiltrating gliomas operated on by the senior author who then assessed the validity and practical utility of the re-parcellated diffusion data. We demonstrate a rapid and effective ML parcellation approach to parcellation of the human cortex during anatomical distortion. Our approach overcomes limitations of indiscriminately applying atlas-based registration from healthy subjects by employing a voxel-wise connectivity approach based on individual data.

N2  -  Purpose: To present a stimulated-echo based mapping (STEM) approach for simultaneous T-1, T-2, and ADC mapping.
Methods: Diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo images with various combinations of mixing time (TM), TE, and b-value were acquired to enable simultaneous mapping of T-1, T-2, and ADC. The proposed STEM method was performed by densely sampling the TM-TE-b space in a phantom and in brain and prostate of healthy volunteers. T-1, T-2, and ADC from STEM were compared to reference mapping methods. Additionally, protocol optimization was performed to enable rapid STEM acquisition within 2 min by sparsely sampling the TM-TE-b space. The T-1, T-2, and ADC measurements from rapid acquisitions were compared to the densely sampled STEM for evaluation. Finally, a patient with biopsy-proven high-risk prostate cancer was imaged to demonstrate the ability of STEM to differentiate cancer and healthy tissues.; Results: Relative to the reference measurements, densely sampled STEM provided accurate quantitative T-1, T-2, and ADC mapping in phantoms (R-2 = 0.999, slope between 0.97-1.03), as well as in brain and prostate. Further, the T-1, T-2, and ADC measurements from the optimized rapid STEM acquisitions agreed closely with densely sampled STEM. Finally, STEM showed decreased T-2 and ADC in prostate cancer compared to healthy prostate tissue.; Conclusion: STEM provides accurate simultaneous mapping of T-1, T-2, and ADC. This method may enable rapid and accurate multi-parametric tissue characterization for clinical and research applications.

N2  -  Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating form of cancer with a poor prognosis despite available treatments. Managing recurrent GBM remains challenging and lacks guidelines. This study aims to provide practice patterns for managing recurrent GBMs in India. Methods A panel of experts was assembled to develop practice patterns using the Delphi technique. Their responses were analyzed anonymously to ensure impartiality and generate recommendations. The statements were intended to be nonbinding and focused on promoting best practices in the field, without legal or regulatory authority. Results A total of 23 experts participated in the study, providing their opinions on various aspects of managing recurrent GBM. Consensus was achieved on individualized and multidisciplinary management as the preferred approach. Surgery in combination with other treatments was found to impact survival in patients older than 65 years, with re-surgery and adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy being the preferred options. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging was favored. Molecular profiling was considered significant, with O 6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase methylation being most relevant. Surgery was recommended for recurrent GBMs, primarily based on Karnofsky's performance score (KPS). Surgical adjuncts such as neuronavigation and intraoperative MRI were considered valuable. Radiation therapy, specifically stereotactic radiosurgery, was recommended for selected cases, while opinions on re-chemotherapy were divided. Palliative care was deemed important. Conclusion This study presents practice patterns for managing recurrent GBM in India, providing standardized recommendations for practice. By implementing these, clinicians can make informed decisions, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced variability in the management of recurrent GBM.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) captures ischemic tissue that is likely to infarct, and has become one of the most widely used acute stroke imaging techniques. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) has lately been postulated as a complementary MRI method to stratify the heterogeneously damaged DWI lesion. However, the conventional DKI acquisition time is relatively long, limiting its use in the acute stroke setting. Recently, a fast kurtosis mapping method has been demonstrated in fixed brains and control subjects. The fast DKI approach provides mean diffusion and kurtosis measurements under substantially reduced scan time, making it amenable to acute stroke imaging. Because it is not practical to obtain and compare different means of DKI to test whether the fast DKI method can reliably detect diffusion and kurtosis lesions in acute stroke patients, our study investigated its diagnostic value using an animal model of acute stroke, a critical step before fast DKI acquisition can be routinely applied in the acute stroke setting. We found significant correlation, per voxel, between the diffusion and kurtosis coefficients measured using the fast and conventional DKI protocols. In acute stroke rats, the two DKI methods yielded diffusion and kurtosis lesions that were in good agreement. Importantly, substantial kurtosis-diffusion lesion mismatch was observed using the conventional (26 +/- 13%, P<0.01) and fast DKI methods (23 +/- 8%, P<0.01). In addition, regression analysis showed that the kurtosis-diffusion lesion mismatches obtained using conventional and fast DKI methods were substantially correlated (R-2=0.57, P=0.02). Our results confirmed that the recently proposed fast DKI method is capable of capturing heterogeneous diffusion and kurtosis lesions in acute ischemic stroke, and thus is suitable for translational applications in the acute stroke clinical setting.

N2  -  Background and Purpose We evaluate associations between the severity of magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging abnormalities, as assessed by the hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR), on infarct progression and functional outcome in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2).
Methods Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging lesion volumes were determined with the RAPID software program. HIR was defined as the proportion of TMax >6 s lesion volume with a Tmax >10 s delay and was dichotomized based on its median value (0.4) into low versus high subgroups as well as quartiles. Final infarct volumes were assessed at day 5. Initial infarct growth velocity was calculated as the baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume divided by the delay from symptom onset to baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Total Infarct growth was determined by the difference between final infarct and baseline DWI volumes. Collateral flow was assessed on conventional angiography and dichotomized into good and poor flow. Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 2 at 90 days.; Results Ninety-nine patients were included; baseline DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and final infarct volumes increased with HIR quartiles (P<0.01). A high HIR predicted poor collaterals with an area under the curve of 0.73. Initial infarct growth velocity and total infarct growth were greater among patients with a high HIR (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, DWI volume, and reperfusion, a low HIR was associated with good functional outcome: odds ratio=4.4 (95% CI, 1.3-14.3); P=0.014.; Conclusions HIR can be easily assessed on automatically processed perfusion maps and predicts the rate of collateral flow, infarct growth, and clinical outcome.

N2  -  Q-space analysis is an alternative analysis technique for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data in which the probability density function (PDF) for molecular diffusion is estimated without the need to assume a Gaussian shape. Although used in the human brain, q-space DWI has not yet been applied to study the human spinal cord in vivo. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of performing q-space imaging in the cervical spinal cord of eight healthy volunteers and four patients with multiple sclerosis. The PDF was computed and water displacement and zerodisplacement probability maps were calculated from the width and height of the PDF, respectively. In the dorsal column white matter, q-space contrasts showed a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the width and a decrease in the height of the PDF in lesions, the result of increased diffusion. These q-space contrasts, which are sensitive to the slow diffusion component, exhibited improved detection of abnormal diffusion compared to perpendicular apparent diffusion constant measurements. The conspicuity of lesions compared favorably with magnetization transfer (MT)-weighted images and quantitative CSIF-normalized MT measurements. Thus, q-space DWI can be used to study water diffusion in the human spinal cord in vivo and is well suited to assess white matter damage.

N2  -  The sensorimotor flow of information can be divided in three steps: perception, processing and reaction. Environmental impulses are conducted through receptors to the central nervous system (CNS). The impulses arriving in the somatosensory cortex are processed through complex interactions between sensory and motor areas. The motor action in response to the environmental changes is transferred from the motor cortex via the pyramidal tract, spinal tracts and motor neurons to the respective muscles. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) it is possible to assess somatosensory and motor activation in the different cortical areas involved. Clinically, this information is used to assess the local relationship between brain tumors and functionally important areas. This is important to ensure an optimal individual therapeutic approach with the aim of an as radical as possible tumor resection with preservation of the motor and somatosensory functions. Furthermore, fMRI enables the evaluation of pathological changes of cerebral activation. This review describes the functional somatosensory and motor systems and gives an insight into the potential of fMRI.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate whether it is possible in patients with peri-ventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) to detect abnormal fiber projections that have only previously been reported in the histopathology literature.
Materials and Methods: Whole-brain diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging data from 14 patients with bilateral PVNH and 14 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects were prospectively acquired by using 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging between August 1, 2008, and December 5, 2012. All participants provided written informed consent. The DW imaging data were processed to generate whole-brain constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography data and super-resolution track-density imaging (TDI) maps. The tractography data were overlaid on coregistered three-dimensional T1-weighted images to visually assess regions of heterotopia. A panel of MR imaging researchers independently assessed each case and indicated numerically (no = 1, yes = 2) as to the presence of abnormal fiber tracks in nodular tissue. The Fleiss kappa statistical measure was applied to assess the reader agreement.; Results: Abnormal fiber tracks emanating from one or more regions of heterotopia were reported by all four readers in all 14 patients with PVNH (Fleiss kappa = 1). These abnormal structures were not visible on the tractography data from any of the control subjects and were not discernable on the conventional T1-weighted images of the patients with PVNH.; Conclusion: Whole-brain CSD-based fiber tractography and super-resolution TDI mapping reveals abnormal fiber projections in nodular tissue suggestive of abnormal organization of white matter (with abnormal fibers both within nodules and projecting to the surrounding white matter) in patients with bilateral PVNH.

N2  -  With the advent of recent deep learning techniques, computerized methods for automatic lesion segmentation have reached performances comparable to those of medical practitioners. However, little attention has been paid to the detection of subtle physiological changes caused by evolutive pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we leverage deep learning models to detect anomalies in brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameter maps of recently diagnosed and untreated (de novo) patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). For this purpose, we trained auto-encoders on parameter maps of healthy controls (n = 56) and tested them on those of de novo PD patients (n = 129). We considered large reconstruction errors between the original and reconstructed images to be anomalies that, when quantified, allow discerning between de novo PD patients and healthy controls. The most discriminating brain macro-region was found to be the white matter with a ROC-AUC 68.3 (IQR 5.4) and the best subcortical structure, the GPi (ROC-AUC 62.6 IQR 5.4). Our results indicate that our deep learning-based model can detect potentially pathological regions in de novo PD patients, without requiring any expert delineation. This may enable extracting neuroimaging biomarkers of PD in the future, but further testing on larger cohorts is needed. Such models can be seamlessly extended with additional parameter maps and applied to study the physio-pathology of other neurological diseases.

N2  -  The grading of glioma has clinical significance in determining a treatment strategy and evaluating prognosis to investigate a novel set of radiomic features extracted from the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences for computer-aided grading of gliomas. This retrospective study included 108 patients who had pathologically confirmed brain gliomas and DTI scanned during 2012-2018. This cohort included 43 low-grade gliomas (LGGs; all grade II) and 65 high-grade gliomas (HGGs; grade III or IV). We extracted a set of radiomic features, including traditional texture, morphological, and novel deep features derived from pre-trained convolutional neural network models, in the manually-delineated tumor regions. We employed support vector machine and these radiomic features for two classification tasks: LGGs vs HGGs, and grade III vs IV. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was reported as the performance metrics using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. When combining FA+MD, AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 0.94, sensitivity = 0.98, and specificity = 0.86 in classifying LGGs from HGGs, while AUC = 0.99, accuracy = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.98, and specificity = 1.00 in classifying grade III from IV. The AUC and accuracy remain close when features were extracted from only the solid tumor or additionally including necrosis, cyst, and peritumoral edema. Still, the effects in terms of sensitivity and specificity are mixed. Deep radiomic features derived from pre-trained convolutional neural networks showed higher prediction ability than the traditional texture and shape features in both classification experiments. Radiomic features extracted on the FA and MD maps of brain DTI images are useful for noninvasively classification/grading of LGGs vs HGGs, and grade III vs IV.

N2  -  This paper deals with two unusual clinical pictures of migraine. In the first case report, a 10-year-old boy suffered from an attack of hemiplegic migraine with headache and left-sided hemiplegia with persistent aura without infarction, and recovered almost completely within 6 months of onset. Repeated conventional magnetic resonance imaging revealed no structural lesion of the brain, merely a subsiding light hypoperfusion in the frontal precentral regions bilaterally evident in perfusion-weighted imaging. Findings in diffusion-weighted imaging and ADC maps were repeatedly normal. Examination of cerebral blood flow with single proton emission computed tomography was repeatedly normal. In the second case report, a 14-year-old boy suffered from a severe attack of migraine accompanied by delirium. Subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis and other structural lesions of the CNS were ruled out, while a toxicological examination, including alcohol, proved normal. The patient recovered within 12 hours.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) is useful for elucidating the status of the corticospinal tract (CST). The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of DTT for determining the causes of motor weakness in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Five patients with TBI were recruited for this study. DTT was performed using 1.5-T with a Synergy-L Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE) head coil. DTT was obtained with termination criteria of FA < 0.2 and an angle change > 45 degrees. On the DTT of patient 1, who had diffuse axonal injury, the focal lesion was detected in the left pons, and was not detected on routine brain images. In patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage, the integrity of the CST of patient 3 was preserved, although the lesion was more extensive than that of patient 2, who showed severe degeneration with the disruption of the CST at the lesion site. In patient 4, the integrity of the left CST was disrupted by a left transtentorial herniation. Although the CST of the affected hemisphere was connected at the cortex level in patient 5, who had a cortical contusional hemorrhage, the motor function of the lower extremity was worse than that of the upper extremity according to the involvement of the somatotopic area of the primary motor cortex. DTT would be useful in elucidating the causes of motor weakness in patients with TBI at the subcortical level, including conditions such as diffuse axonal injury, deep intracerebral hemorrhage, and transtentorial herniation.

N2  -  Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused UltraSound (MRgFUS) offers an incisionless approach to treat essential tremor (ET). Due to lack of evident internal anatomy on traditional structural imaging, indirect targeting must still be used to localize the lesion. Here, we investigate the potential predictive value of probabilistic tractography guided thalamic targeting by defining how tractography-defined targets, lesion size and location, and clinical outcomes interrelate.
MR imaging and clinical outcomes from 12 ET patients that underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy in a pilot study at the University of Virginia were evaluated in this analysis. FSL was used to evaluate each patient's voxel-wise thalamic connectivity with FreeSurfer generated pre-and post-central gyrus targets, to generate thalamic target maps. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the overlap between these thalamic target maps and the MRgFUS lesion was systematically evaluated relative to clinical outcome. To further define the connectivity characteristics of effective MRgFUS thalamotomy lesions, we evaluated whole brain probabilistic tractography of lesions (using post-treatment imaging to define the lesion pre-treatment diffusion tensor MRI). The structural connectivity difference was explored between subjects with the best clinical outcome relative to all others.; Ten of twelve patients presented high percentage of overlapping between connectivity-based thalamic segmentation maps and lesion area. The improvement of clinical score was predicted (AUC:0.80) using the volume of intersection between the thalamic target (precentral gyrus) map and MRgFUS induced lesion as feature. The main structural differences between those with different magnitudes of response were observed in connectivity to the pre-and post-central gyri and brainstemcerebellum.; MRgFUS thalamotomy lesions characterized by strong structural connectivity to precentral gyrus demonstrated better responses in a cohort of patients treated with MRgFUS for ET. The intersection between lesion and thalamic-connectivity maps to motor - sensory targets proved to be effective in predicting the response to the therapy. These imaging techniques can be used to increase the efficacy and consistency of outcomes with MRgFUS and potentially shorten treatment times by identifying optimal targets in advance of treatment.

N2  -  Neuropathological studies in Huntington disease (HD) have demonstrated neuronal loss in the striatum, as well as in other brain regions including the cortex. With diffusion tensor MRI we evaluated the hypothesis that the clinical dysfunction in HD is related to regionally specific lesions of circuit-specific cortico-basal ganglia networks rather than to the striatum only. We included 27 HD and 24 controls from the TRACK-HD Paris cohort. The following assessments were used: self-paced tapping tasks, trail B making test (TMT), University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT), and apathy scores from the problem behaviors assessment. Group comparisons of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity and correlations were performed using voxel-based analysis. In the cortex, HD patients showed significant correlations between: (i) self paced tapping and mean diffusivity in the parietal lobe at 1.8 Hz and prefrontal areas at 3 Hz, (ii) UPSIT and mean diffusivity in the parietal, and median temporal lobes, the cingulum and the insula, and fractional anisotropy in the insula and the external capsule, (iii) TMT B and mean diffusivity in the white matter of the superior frontal, orbital, temporal, superior parietal and post central areas, and (iv) apathy and fractional anisotropy in the white matter of the rectus gyrus. In the basal ganglia, we found correlations between the self paced tapping, UPSIT, TMT tests, and mean diffusivity in the anterior part of the putamen and the caudate nucleus. In conclusion, disruption of motor, associative and limbic cortico-striatal circuits differentially contribute to the clinical signs of the disease. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2141-2153, 2013.

N2  -  For glioblastoma (GBM), current therapeutic approaches focus on the combination of several therapies, each of them individually approved for GBM or other tumor types. Many efforts are made to decipher the best sequence of treatments that would ultimately promote the most efficient tumor response. There is therefore a strong interest in developing new clinical in vivo imaging procedures that can rapidly detect treatment efficacy and allow individual modulation of the treatment. In this preclinical study, we propose to evaluate tumor tissue changes under combined therapies, tumor vascular normalization under antiangiogenic treatment followed by radiotherapy, using a voxel-based clustering approach. This approach was applied to a rat model of glioma (F98). Six MRI parameters were mapped: apparent diffusion coefficient, vessel wall permeability, cerebral blood volume fraction, cerebral blood flow, tissue oxygen saturation and vessel size index. We compared the classical region of interest (ROI)-based analysis with a cluster-based analysis. Five clusters, defined by their MRI features, were sufficient to characterize tumor progression and tumor changes during treatments. These results suggest that the cluster-based analysis was as efficient as the ROI-based analysis to assess tumor physiological changes during treatment, but also gave additional information regarding the voxels impacted by treatments and their localization within the tumor. Overall, cluster-based analysis appears to be a powerful tool for subtle monitoring of tumor changes during combined therapies.

N2  -  Middle cerebral artery dissection (MCAD) is a rare condition with no consensus on its treatment strategy and prognosis. This report describes a case of MCAD with perforating artery infarction in which radiographic findings progressed despite a lack of symptoms following maintenance infusion without antithrombotic therapy. A five-year-old boy presented to our hospital with right hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffusion restriction in the left basal ganglia. Additionally, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed irregular walls in the horizontal portion of the left middle cerebral artery. MRA performed three months after admission revealed progressive stenosis but no new ischemic lesions. MCAD can be associated with long-term morphological changes in the vessel walls. Intracranial artery dissection (IAD) in pediatric patients often presents without headache or neck pain, and serial imaging helps monitor disease progression. In conclusion, the morphology of the vessels can change over several months. Especially in pediatric patients, IAD often presents without headache or neck pain, and serial imaging evaluations help monitor disease progression.

N2  -  Purpose To develop and validate a dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-based radiomics model to predict epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification in patients with glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype.
Methods Patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, from January 2015 to December 2020, with an EGFR amplification status, were included. Patients who did not undergo DCE or conventional brain MRI were excluded. Patients were categorized into training and test sets by a ratio of 7:3. DCE MRI data were used to generate volume transfer constant (K-trans) and extracellular volume fraction (V-e) maps. K-trans, V-e, and conventional MRI were then used to extract the radiomics features, from which the prediction models for EGFR amplification status were developed and validated.; Results A total of 190 patients (mean age, 59.9; male, 55.3%), divided into training (n = 133) and test (n = 57) sets, were enrolled. In the test set, the radiomics model using the K-trans map exhibited the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 0.80 (95% confidence interval CI, 0.65-0.95). The AUROC for the V-e map-based and conventional MRI-based models were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58-0.90) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61-0.91).; Conclusion The DCE MRI-based radiomics model that predicts EGFR amplification in glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, was developed and validated. The MRI-based radiomics model using the K-trans map has higher AUROC than conventional MRI.

N2  -  Background: We evaluated the ability of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to differentiate between hepatic abscess and cystic or necrotic liver tumor.
Methods: DW MR imaging was performed in 18 patients who had liver masses with large cystic or necrotic cavities detected by computed tomography or ultrasonography. The final diagnoses were pyogenic abscess (five cases), fungal abscess (one), hepatocellular carcinoma (five), cystic metastasis (four), and hepatic cyst (three). Signal intensities on the DW images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were noted. ADCs in all lesions were calculated and compared with Student's t test.; Results: All lesions, except hepatic cysts, showed either heterogeneous or homogeneous rim enhancement on postgadolinium images. All abscess cavities showed hyperintensity on DW images and hypointensity on ADC maps. Conversely, the cystic or necrotic portions of all tumors showed hypointensity on DW images and hyperintensity on ADC maps. The mean ADCs (mm(2)s) were 0.67 +- 0.35 X 10(-3) in hepatic abscess, 2.65 +- 0.49 X 10(-3) in cystic or necrotic tumor, 2.93 +- 0.52 X 10(-3) in hepatic cyst, and 1.98 +- 0.37 X 10(-3) in normal liver parenchyma.; Conclusion: DW MR imaging, with the help of ADCs, may be a useful noninvasive imaging technique in differentiating hepatic abscess from cystic or necrotic tumor.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To implement fiber tracking in a common neuronavigation environment for routine clinical use to visualize major white matter tracts intraoperatively.
METHODS: A single-shot, spin-echo diffusion weighted echo planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanner was used for diffusion tensor imaging. For three-dimensional (3-D) tractography, we applied a knowledge-based multiple volume of interest approach. Tracking was initiated in each voxel of the initial seed volume in retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the major eigenvector by applying a tensor deflection algorithm. Tractography results were displayed as streamlines assigned direction encoding color. After selecting the fiber tract bundle of interest by defining inclusion and exclusion volumes, a 3-D object was generated automatically by wrapping the whole fiber tract bundle. This 3-D object was displayed along with other contours representing tumor outline and further functional data with the microscope heads-up display.; RESULTS: In 16 patients (three cavernomas, 13 gliomas), major white matter tracts (pyramidal tract, n = 14; optic radiation, n = 2) were visualized intraoperatively with a standard navigation system. Three patients developed a postoperative paresis, which resolved in two in the postoperative course. Additional planning time for tractography amounted to up to 10 minutes. Comparing the tractography results with a fiber bundle generated on a different platform by applying a distortion-free sequence revealed a good congruency of the defined 3-D outlines in the area of interest.; CONCLUSION: Fiber tract data can be reliably integrated into a standard neuronavigation system, allowing for intraoperative visualization and localization of major white matter tracts such as the pyramidal tract or optic radiation.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Tractography-based targeting of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (T-VIM) is a novel method conferring patient-specific selection of VIM coordinates for tremor surgery; however, its accuracy and clinical utility in magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy compared to conventional indirect targeting has not been specifically addressed. This retrospective study sought to compare the treatment locations and potential adverse effect profiles of T-VIM with indirect targeting in a large cohort of MRgFUS thalamotomy patients.
METHODS: T-VIM was performed using diffusion tractography outlining the pyramidal and medial lemniscus tracts in 43 MRgFUS thalamotomy patients. T-VIM coordinates were compared with the indirect treatment coordinates used in the procedure. Thalamotomy lesions were delineated on postoperative T1-weighted images and displaced ("translated") by the anteroposterior and mediolateral difference between T-VIM and treatment coordinates. Both translated and actual lesions were normalized to standard space and subsequently overlaid with areas previously reported to be associated with an increased risk of motor and sensory adverse effects when lesioned during MRgFUS thalamotomy.; RESULTS: T-VIM coordinates were 2.18 mm anterior and 1.82 mm medial to the "final" indirect treatment coordinates. Translated lesions lay more squarely within the boundaries of the VIM compared to nontranslated lesions and showed significantly less overlap with areas associated with sensory adverse effects. Translated lesions overlapped less with areas associated with motor adverse effects; however, this difference was not significant.; CONCLUSIONS: T-VIM leads to the selection of more anterior and medial coordinates than the conventional indirect methods. Lesions moved toward these anteromedial coordinates avoid areas associated with an increased risk of motor and sensory adverse effects, suggesting that T-VIM may improve clinical outcomes.

N2  -  In this work, we report a case study of a stroke model in animals using two methods of quantification of the deviations from Gaussian behaviour: diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and log-normal distribution function imaging (LNDFI). The affected regions were predominantly in grey rather than in white matter. The parameter maps were constructed for metrics quantifying the apparent diffusivity (evaluated from conventional diffusion tensor imaging, DKI and LNDFI) and for those quantifying the degree of deviations (mean kurtosis and a parameter s characterising the width of the distribution). We showed that both DKI and LNDFI were able to dramatically enhance the visualisation of ischaemic lesions in comparison with conventional methods. The largest relative change in the affected versus healthy regions was observed in the mean kurtosis values. The average changes in the mean kurtosis and s values in the lesions were a factor of two to three larger than the relative changes observed in the mean diffusivity. In conclusion, the applied methods promise valuable perspectives in the assessment of stroke. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Although targeted by radiotherapy, recurrence in glioblastoma occurs mainly periresectionally owing to tumor infiltration. An increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been shown in the large high-T2 area on magnetic resonance imaging post-treatment; however, until now ADC has not been investigated directly in the more relevant periresectional area.
METHODS: Histogram analysis was used to assess periresectional ADC values in patients with glioblastoma postradiotherapy versus preradiotherapy. Periresectional ADC values starting at 0-5 mm in 5-mm increments up to 20-25 mm were extracted and compared using 2-way repeated-measurements analysis of variance.; RESULTS: Mean ADC values directly adjacent to the resection area (0-5 mm) were significantly higher postradiotherapy compared with preradiotherapy (P = .017). ADC values in the 0- to 5-mm region were also higher than those in 5- to 10-, 10- to 15-, and 15- to 20-mm regions (P < .05). Regional standard deviations in ADC values were higher postradiotherapy compared with preradiotherapy for the 0- to 5-mm region up to the 15- to 20-mm region, inclusive (P < .05); however, Cox regression analysis showed no survival benefits from the increased ADC in the 0- to 5-mm region postradiotherapy.; CONCLUSIONS: Increased ADC values, representing a decrease in infiltrative tumor load, were demonstrated in a limited direct periresectional area. This finding adds to previous studies evaluating ADC response in the larger high-T2 area in relation to survival.

T2  -  CURRENT DRUG TARGETS

N2  -  Because primary brain tumors treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, this has led investigators to develop new innovative therapies such as targeted toxins. These large molecules do not cross the blood brain barrier and must be delivered into the brain by a technique known as convection-enhanced delivery (CED). When administering these agents, there are a number of pharmacokinetic considerations that must be considered that will directly affect the volume of distribution of the drug being administered and ultimately the therapeutic effect of the agent. A number of different catheter types have been used to perform CED with a hollow fiber design offering several advantages over other variations. Specific parameters have been developed to optimize the placement of the drug delivery catheters in order to enhance drug distribution in the brain. Considerable effort has been expended to identify a reliable way to image the distribution of targeted toxins administered by CED using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography. Unfortunately many infusions performed in tumor patients are unsuccessful due to ventricular/subarachnoid leak or pooling of the drug in necrotic tumor tissue. To date, no targeted toxin clinical trial has demonstrated statistically significant clinical results leading to the universal acceptance of this treatment. Other agents such as standard chemotherapy or liposomal preparations have been delivered by CED. Nonneoplastic neurological diseases are being considered for treatment by CED and treating different locations of the brain other that the cerebral hemispheres are under investigation.

N2  -  The object of this study was to extensively characterize a region of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) in an epilepsy patient to reveal its possible neurocognitive functional role(s). The authors used 3-T MRI approaches to exhaustively characterize a single, right hemisphere heterotopion in a high-functioning adult male with medically responsive epilepsy, which had manifested during late adolescence. The heterotopion proved to be spectroscopically consistent with a cortical-like composition and was interconnected with nearby ipsilateral cortical fundi, as revealed by fiber tractography (diffusion-weighted imaging) and resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfMRI). Moreover, the region of PVNH demonstrated two novel characterizations for a heterotopion. First, functional MRI (fMRI), as distinct from rsfMRI, showed that the heterotopion was significantly modulated while the patient watched animated video scenes of biological motion (i.e., cartoons). Second, rsfMRI, which demonstrated correlated brain activity during a task-negative state, uniquely showed directionality within an interconnected network, receiving positive path effects from patent cortical and cerebellar foci while outputting only negative path effects to specific brain foci.
These findings are addressed in the context of the impact on noninvasive presurgical brain mapping strategies for adult and pediatric patient workups, as well as the impact of this study on an understanding of the functional cortical architecture underlying cognition from a neurodiversity and evolutionary perspective.

N2  -  We conducted a study to evaluate the degree of corticospinal tract (CST) dysfunction associated with diffuse axonal injury (DAI) through analyses of both diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) and motor-evoked potential (MEP). Using DTMRI and MEP with transcranial magnetic stimulation, we evaluated 138 instances of CST in 52 patients with severe chronic DAI and compared them with the findings in 17 normal volunteers. We determined values of fractional anisotropy (FA) on FA maps obtained with DTMRI of six regions of interest (ROIs) in the CST, consisting of the semioval center, coronal radiation, posterior limb of internal capsule, midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata. The lowest value of %FA for each of the six ROIs in each CST was defined as the minimum %FA, and the lowest magnetic stimulation strength that produced MEP was defined as the minimum threshold for MEP. The mean minimum %FA for CSTs in which MEP could not be obtained even with maximum magnetic stimulation (the MEP-group) was significantly lower than that of CSTs in which MEP could be obtained (the MEP+ group). ROIs with the lowest %FA value were the midbrain in the MEP+ group and the medulla oblongata in the MEP-group. In the MEP+ group, a serial decrease in the minimum %FA value significantly correlated with a serial increase in minimum threshold for MEP. These results show that in patients with chronic DAI, physiological motor dysfunction as revealed by MEP correlates significantly with morphological damage to the CST as detected by DTMRI. This strongly suggests that DTMRI can be a valuable tool for evaluating aberrant motor function and for estimating its severity in DAI.

Comparing the tractography results with a fiber bundle generated on a different platform by applying a distortion-free sequence revealed a good congruency of the defined 3-D outlines in the area of interest.; CONCLUSION: Fiber tract data can be reliably integrated into a standard neuronavigation system, allowing for intraoperative visualization and localization of major white matter tracts such as the pyramidal tract or optic radiation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Ecchordosis physaliphora (EP) is a benign notochordal remnant that is usually asymptomatic. We report a case of a symptomatic large EP mimicking an epidermoid cyst.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old woman presented with right facial dysesthesia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with a diameter of 3.2 cm that was hypointense on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, isointense to hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging, and hyperintense on apparent diffusion coefficient map (1.2-1.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)second). There was no apparent contrast enhancement. Differential diagnoses included epidermoid cyst, dermoid cyst, EP, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, neurenteric cyst, and arachnoid cyst. Clinicopathologic examination revealed that the mass was an EP.; CONCLUSIONS: EP in the prepontine cistern should be considered in the differential diagnosis of epidermoid cyst.

N2  -  Recently, several capsular stroke models have been reported with different targets of destruction. This study was performed to establish an accurate internal capsule (IC) target for capsular stroke modeling in rats. We injected adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV)-CaMKII-EYFP into forelimb motor cortex and AAV-CaMKII-mCherry into hindlimb motor cortex (n = 9) to anterogradely trace the pyramidal fibers and map their somatotopic distribution in the IC. On the basis of the neural tracing results, we created photothrombotic infarct lesions in rat forelimb and hindlimb motor fiber (FMF and HMF) areas of the IC (n = 29) and assessed motor behavior using a forelimb-use asymmetry test, a foot-fault test, and a single-pellet reaching test. We found that the FMFs and HMFs were primarily distributed in the inferior portion of the posterior limb of the IC, with the FMFs located largely ventral to the HMFs but with an area of partial overlap. Photothrombotic lesions in the FMF area resulted in persistent motor deficits. In contrast, lesions in the HMF area did not result in persistent motor deficits. These results indicate that identification of the somatotopic distribution of pyramidal fibers is critical for accurate targeting in animal capsular stroke models: only infarcts in the FMF area resulted in long-lasting motor deficits.

N2  -  High-resolution (200 x 200 x 1 500 pm 3) imaging Was performed to derive quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in stroke rats (permanent occlusion) every 30 minutes up to 3 hours after occlusion onset. followed by histology at 24 hours. An improved automated iterative-self-organizing-data-analysis-algorithm (ISODATA) was developed to dynamically track ischemic tissue fate on a pixel-by-pixel basis during the acute phase. ISODATA-resolved clusters were overlaid on the CBF-ADC scatterplots and image spaces. Tissue volume ADC, and CBF of each ISODATA cluster were derived. In contrast to the single-cluster normal left hemisphere (ADC = 0.74 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, CBF = 1.36 +/- 0.22 mL g(-1) min(-1). mean +/- SD, It = 8), the right ischemic hemisphere exhibited three ISODATA clusters. namely: "normal" (normal ADC and CBF), "ischemic core" (low CBF and ADC), and at-risk "perfusion-diffusion mismatch" (low CBF but normal ADC). At 180 minutes. the mismatch disappeared in five rats (Group 1, 180-minute "core" lesion volume = 255 +/- 62 mm(3) and 24- hour infarct volume = 253 +/- 55 mm(3), P > 0.05), while a substantial mismatch persisted in three rats (Group II, 180-minute CBF-abnormal Volume = 198 +/- 7 mm(3) and 24-hour infarct Volume 148 18 mm(3), P < 0.05). The CBF (0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1) min(-1)) of the "persistent mismatch" (Group II, 0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1) min(-1)) was above the CBF viability threshold (0.2 to 0.3 mL g(-1) min(-1)) throughout and its ADC (0.70 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm(2)/S) did not decrease as ischemia progressed. In contrast, the CBF (0.08 +/- 0.03 mL g(-1)min(-1)) of the analogous brain region in Group I was below the CBF viability threshold, and its ADC gradually decreased from 0.63 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) m(2)/S (ADC viability threshold 0.53 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm(2)/S). The modified ISODATA analysis of the ADC and CBF tissue characteristics during the acute phase could provide a useful and unbiased means to characterize and predict tissue fates in ischemic brain injury and to monitor therapeutic intervention.

N2  -  Object. Recently, diffusion tensor (DT) imaging was introduced to demonstrate white matter tracts. However, research interest has focused on the anatomical rather than the functional aspects of this imaging modality. The authors undertook a functional analysis of DT imaging to determine the relationship between weakness and changes on DT images.
Methods. Diffusion tensor images were obtained in 23 patients with lesions located adjacent to the pyramidal tract. Patients were classified according to their motor deficit. Axial magnetic resonance image sections through the maximum tumor diameters were selected and the mean apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and mean fractional anisotropies (FAs) were measured. One ovoid region of interest (ovROI) was placed in the center of the pyramidal tract and another was designed to include the whole pyramidal tract at the same axial level (wROI). To determine intraobserver variability, a single neurosurgeon measured mean ADCs and FAs four times by using these two different ROI types without knowledge of any clinical information. To determine interobserver variability, a second neurosurgeon who was also unaware of any clinical information measured the mean ADCs and FAs by using the wROI method.; The five measurements produced the same results. The mean FA at the lesion side of the pyramidal tract was significantly lower in patients with weakness (p < 0.01). Little intraobserver measurement variability occurred using the ovROI method, and no interobserver variability occurred using the wROI method.; Conclusions. Motor weakness was significantly related to a low mean FA in the pyramidal tract on the lesion side. Designing an ROI that includes the whole pyramidal tract is an easier and more reproducible method than using an ovROI method.

N2  -  Introduction: Mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is a clinical-radiologic syndrome presenting with a reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. MERS is associated with many potential etiologies, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in children. We report an adult patient with CMV-associated MERS. Case Report: A previously healthy 25-year-old man was admitted with a 4-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an isolated lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum with hyperintensity on T2 and diffusion-weighted sequences and reduced values on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. High throughput gene detection for pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid revealed infection with CMV. The splenial lesion resolved 4 weeks after onset. Conclusion: This is the first report an adult patient with CMV-associated MERS. Recognition of this clinical-radiologic syndrome can guide diagnosis and management.

N2  -  BACKGROUND Early surgical decompressive craniectomy (less than 24 hours) for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MCA) provides life-saving benefits. Detection of the infarction territory with computed tomography (CT) scan is usually less sensitive and delayed than diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that is capable of defecting the infarction territory in as little as 5 minutes after onset. Based on the DWI and clinical neurologic evaluations, ultra-early (less than 6 hours) decompressive craniectomy for malignant MCA infarction may be very helpful in improving mortality and morbidity rates.
METHODS We treated 52 patients with malignant MCA infarction. Clinical neurologic presentation was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The infarction territory was evaluated by either DWI or CT. Patients were divided into three groups (Group A: ultra-early, Group 13: craniectomy beyond 6 hours, and Group C: no operation). Anterior temporal lobectomy was performed according to the ICP levels OCP >30 mm Hg) after decompressive craniectomy.; RESULTS Group A had statistically lower mortality rates than Groups B and C (8.7% in Group A, 36.7% in Group B and 80% in Group Q. Group A patients also had better prognosis of conscious recovery on the 7th day of onset (91.7% in Group A, 55% in Group B and 0% in Group Q. Group A had statistically better Barthel Indexes than Group B, p < 0.05. Group A and Group B had better GOS levels than Group C, p < 0.001. Diagnosis by CT was accurate in only 33% of patients while the accuracy of DWI to detect malignant MCA infarction was 100% within 6 hours of onset. In surgical Group A and B, thirteen patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy, and 67% survived. All patients with ICP levels of more than 30 mm Hg who did not undergo further anterior temporal lobectomy died.; CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent decompressive surgery had better outcomes than patients who did not have the operation. Ultra-early intervention with decompressive craniectomy with ICP monitoring before neurologic conditions become worse may reduce the mortality rate, increase the conscious recovery rate, and improve neurologic sequels for malignant MCA infarction. DWI with clinical neurologic evaluation (NIHSS, hemiplegia, down-hill GCS) provides for early diagnosis and treatment of malignant MCA infarction. Anterior temporal lobectomy may further reduce intraoperative ICP and reduce mortality, especially when the infarction is at multiple arterial territories. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Radiation therapy, a major method of treatment for brain cancer, may cause severe brain injuries after many years. We used a rare and unique cohort of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with normal-appearing brains to study possible early irradiation injury in its presymptomatic phase before severe, irreversible necrosis happens. The aim is to detect any structural or functional imaging biomarker that is sensitive to early irradiation injury, and to understand the recovery and progression of irradiation injury that can shed light on outcome prediction for early clinical intervention. We found an acute increase in local brain activity that is followed by extensive reductions in such activity in the temporal lobe and significant loss of functional connectivity in a distributed, large-scale, high-level cognitive function-related brain network. Intriguingly, these radiosensitive functional alterations were found to be fully or partially recoverable. In contrast, progressive late disruptions to the integrity of the related far-end white matter structure began to be significant after one year. Importantly, early increased local brain functional activity was predictive of severe later temporal lobe necrosis. Based on these findings, we proposed a dynamic, multifactorial model for radiation injury and another preventive model for timely clinical intervention. Hum Brain Mapp 39:407-427, 2018.

N2  -  Objective. In the field of radiation oncology, the benefit of MRI goes beyond that of providing high soft-tissue contrast images for staging and treatment planning. With the recent clinical introduction of hybrid MRI linear accelerators it has become feasible to map physiological parameters describing diffusion, perfusion, and relaxation during the entire course of radiotherapy, for example. However, advanced data analysis tools are required for extracting qualified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers from longitudinal MRI data. In this study, we propose a new prediction framework tailored to exploit temporal dynamics of tissue features from repeated measurements. We demonstrate the framework using a newly developed decomposition method for tumor characterization. Approach. Two previously published MRI datasets with multiple measurements during and after radiotherapy, were used for development and testing: T (2)-weighted multi-echo images obtained for two mouse models of pancreatic cancer, and diffusion-weighted images for patients with brain metastases. Initially, the data was decomposed using the novel monotonous slope non-negative matrix factorization (msNMF) tailored for MR data. The following processing consisted of a tumor heterogeneity assessment using descriptive statistical measures, robust linear modelling to capture temporal changes of these, and finally logistic regression analysis for stratification of tumors and volumetric outcome. Main Results. The framework was able to classify the two pancreatic tumor types with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.999, P < 0.001 and predict the tumor volume change with a correlation coefficient of 0.513, P = 0.034. A classification of the human brain metastases into responders and non-responders resulted in an AUC of 0.74, P = 0.065. Significance. A general data processing framework for analyses of longitudinal MRI data has been developed and applications were demonstrated by classification of tumor type and prediction of radiotherapy response. Further, as part of the assessment, the merits of msNMF for tumor tissue decomposition were demonstrated.

N2  -  Ischemic small vessel disease (SVD) may lead to cognitive impairment, but cognitive deficits with a given burden of SVD vary significantly. The underlying mechanisms of impaired or preserved cognition are unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of ischemic SVD on rapid-onset cortical plasticity, as induced with a paired-associative stimulation protocol. To exclude concomitant effects of aging, we examined 12 middle-aged patients (48.3 +/- 8.3 years) with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) who suffered from severe ischemic SVD and a group of 12 age-matched controls (49.9 +/- 8.3 years). Cognitive status, motor performance and learning, and motor cortex excitability in response to cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) were assessed. White matter integrity was analyzed by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We found that cognitive and motor functions were largely preserved in CADASIL patients, while rapid-onset cortical plasticity was significantly higher in the CADASIL group compared with controls (repeated measures analysis of variance [group x time] interaction: P = 0.03). This finding was even more pronounced in patients with higher white matter lesion load. ctDCS revealed no evidence of cortical dysplasticity. We conclude that increased rapid-onset cortical plasticity may contribute to largely preserved cognitive and motor function despite extensive ischemic SVD.

N2  -  Dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP) has long been associated with basal ganglia and thalamus lesions. Recent evidence further points at white matter (WM) damage. This study aims to identify altered WM pathways in dyskinetic CP from a standardized, connectome-based approach, and to assess structure-function relationship in WM pathways for clinical outcomes. Individual connectome maps of 25 subjects with dyskinetic CP and 24 healthy controls were obtained combining a structural parcellation scheme with whole-brain deterministic tractography. Graph theoretical metrics and the network-based statistic were applied to compare groups and to correlate WM state with motor and cognitive performance. Results showed a widespread reduction of WM volume in CP subjects compared to controls and a more localized decrease in degree (number of links per node) and fractional anisotropy (FA), comprising parieto-occipital regions and the hippocampus. However, supramarginal gyrus showed a significantly higher degree. At the network level, CP subjects showed a bilateral pathway with reduced FA, comprising sensorimotor, intraparietal and fronto-parietal connections. Gross and fine motor functions correlated with FA in a pathway comprising the sensorimotor system, but gross motor also correlated with prefrontal, temporal and occipital connections. Intelligence correlated with FA in a network with fronto-striatal and parieto-frontal connections, and visuoperception was related to right occipital connections. These findings demonstrate a disruption in structural brain connectivity in dyskinetic CP, revealing general involvement of posterior brain regions with relative preservation of prefrontal areas. We identified pathways in which WM integrity is related to clinical features, including but not limited to the sensorimotor system. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  It is unclear whether reparative processes in the injured mammalian brain are able to restore the topographic organisation of neuronal connections. To address this question, we have investigated the plasticity of the olivocerebellar system. This pathway has a precise topographic arrangement, in which subsets of inferior olivary neurons project to parasagittally oriented Purkinje cell compartments. Following unilateral transection of the inferior cerebellar peduncle in newborn rats, axons from the contralateral projection cross the cerebellar midline and reinnervate the deafferented hemicerebellum. By this experimental approach, we first analysed the behaviour of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive climbing fibres. This marker is transiently expressed by a subset of developing inferior olivary axons, which terminate in the cerebellar cortex into several parasagittal strips. We show that transcommissural axons reestablish the original pattern of climbing fibre bands within a few days after lesion. Then, in adult animals injured at birth, we assessed whether the newly formed climbing fibre bands align with zebrin II+/- Purkinje cell compartments, as in normal conditions. The newly formed projection is organised in parasagittally oriented strips which mirror the distribution of their counterparts on the intact side and are precisely aligned to the heterogeneous Purkinje cell compartments. In addition, the patchy distribution of olive-nuclear fibres suggests that specific reinnervation is also achieved in the deep nuclei. Thus, transcommissural olivocerebellar reinnervation is not random, but it is regulated by selective interactions between distinct subsets of olivocerebellar axons and target neurons aimed at reestablishing the correct projection map.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the relationship of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) parameters with dysfunction in acute focal cerebral ischemia (ACI) rabbits. Methods: The model of ACI in the middle cerebral artery was made using 30 adult male New Zealand rabbits. The dysfunction severities of the ACI rabbits were assessed using Purdy's score. A paired-sample rank sum test was adopted to compare the abnormal signal zone (ASZ) volumes from T-2 weighted imaging (T2WI), dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) imaging, and DWI with a relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) map; correlations were analyzed between the volume of each ASZ and Purdy's score by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The degree of necrotic and apoptotic cells was evaluated in the ASZ from DWI and DSC PWI-DWI mismatch (PDM) zone. Correlations were analyzed between the index of cellular damage and Purdy's score, the volume of ASZs by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The ASZ volumes from DSC-PWI and the rCBF maps were larger than those from DWI (p << 0.001 and p << 0.001, respectively); those from the rCBF map (Z = 0.959, p << 0.001) and DSC-PWI (Z = 0.970, p << 0.001) were positively correlated with DWI; a positive correlation was found between Purdy's score and the ASZ volumes from DSC-PWI (Z = 0.889, p << 0.001), DWI (Z = 0.921, p << 0.001), and rCBF (Z = 0.891, p << 0.001). A significant difference was observed between the ASZ from DWI and the PDM zone in terms of the degree of necrotic (p << 0.001) and apoptotic cells (p << 0.001). The degree of cellular damage in the ASZ of DWI and PDM zone had no relationship with Purdy's score and the volumes of ASZs. Conclusion: The ASZ volumes from DSC-PWI, rCBF, and particularly DWI reflected the level of dysfunction in rabbits with ACI.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to develop a method of registering F-18-FDG PET with MR permeability images for investigating the correlation of F-18-FDG uptake, permeability, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in children with pediatric brain tumors and their relationship with outcome. Methods: Twenty-four children with brain tumors in a phase II study of bevacizumab and irinotecan underwent brain MR and F-18-FDG PET within 2 wk. Tumor types included supratentorial high-grade astrocytoma (n = 7), low-grade glioma (n = 9), brain stem glioma (n = 4), medulloblastoma (n = 2), and ependymoma (n = 2). There were 33 cases (pretreatment only [n = 12], posttreatment only [n = 3], and both pretreatment [n = 9] and posttreatment [n = 9]). F-18-FDG PET images were registered to MR images from the last time point of the T1 perfusion time series using mutual information. Three-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on permeability images were automatically transferred to registered PET images. The quality of ROI registration was graded (1, excellent; 2, very good; 3, good; 4, fair; and 5, poor) by 3 independent experts. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess correlation of maximum tumor permeability (Kps(max)), maximum CBV (CBVmax), and maximum F-18-FDG uptake normalized to white matter (T/W-max). Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations of these parameters with progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The quality of ROI registration between PET and MR was good to excellent in 31 of 33 cases. There was no correlation of baseline Kps(max) with CBVmax (Spearman rank correlation = 0.018 [P = 0.94]) or T/W-max (Spearman rank correlation = 0.07 [P = 0.76]). Baseline CBVmax was correlated with T/W-max (Spearman rank correlation = 0.47 [P = 0.036]). Baseline Kps(max), CBVmax, and T/W-max were not significantly associated with PFS (P = 0.42, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90-1.045, and number of events [n(events)] = 15 for Kps(max); P = 0.41, HR = 0.989, 95% CI = 0.963-1.015, and n(events) = 14 for CBVmax; and P = 0.17, HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.856-2.378, and n(events) = 15 for T/W-max). Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET and MR permeability images were successfully registered and compared across a spectrum of pediatric brain tumors. The lack of correlation between metabolism and permeability may be expected because these parameters characterize different molecular processes. The correlation of CBV and tumor metabolism may be related to an association with tumor grade. More patients are needed for a covariate analysis of these parameters and PFS by tumor histology.

N2  -  Simple Summary Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and malignant histological type of glioma, is associated with a very high mortality rate. MRI is a useful method for the evaluation of tumor growth. However, there are few studies that have quantitatively evaluated the changes in disease state after TMZ treatment against GBM, and it is not fully understood how the effects of treatment are reflected in the quantitative values measured on MRI. We used the C6 glioma rat model to evaluate the tumor changes due to chemotherapy at different doses of TMZ in terms of quantitative values measured by neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and amide proton transfer (APT) imaging using 7T-MRI. These methods can evaluate the microstructural changes caused by TMZ-induced tumor growth inhibition. This study aimed to evaluate tumor changes due to chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) in terms of quantitative values measured by APT imaging and NODDI. We performed TMZ treatment (administered orally by gavage to the TMZ-40 mg and TMZ-60 mg groups) on 7-week-old male Wistar rats with rat glioma C6 implanted in the right brain. T2WI, APT imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and NODDI were performed on days 7 and 14 after implantation using 7T-MRI, and the calculated quantitative values were statistically compared. Then, HE staining was performed on brain tissue at day 7 and day 14 for each group to compare the results with the MR images. TMZ treatment inhibited tumor growth and necrotic area formation. The necrotic areas observed upon hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were consistent with the MTR low-signal areas observed upon APT imaging. The intracellular volume fraction (ICVF) map of the NODDI could best show the microstructure of the tumor, and its value could significantly highlight the difference in treatment effects at different TMZ doses. APT imaging and NODDI can be used to detect the microstructural changes caused by TMZ-induced tumor growth inhibition. The ICVF may be useful as a parameter for determining the effect of TMZ.

N2  -  ObjectiveThe heterogeneity of post-treatment imaging remains a significant challenge in children and teenagers/young adults (TYA) diagnosed with glioma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of F-18-choline PET/MRI in determining intratumoural heterogeneity in paediatric and TYA gliomas. MethodsTwenty-six patients (mean age 16 years, range 8-22 years) with suspected glioma disease progression were evaluated with F-18-choline PET/MRI. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) in enhancing (enh) and non-enhancing (ne) tumour volumes and normal-appearing white matter (wm) were calculated (rCBV(enh), rCBV(ne), rCBV(wm), ADC(enh), ADC(ne), ADC(wm), SUVenh, SUVne and SUVwm). ResultsSignificantly higher SUVenh and SUVne compared with SUVwm were observed [SUVenh 0.89 (0.23-1.90), SUVne 0.36 (0.16-0.78) versus SUVwm 0.15 (0.04-1.19); P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively]. Equivalent results were observed for ADV and rCBV (ADC(enh), ADC(ne): P < 0.001 versus ADC(wm); rCBV(enh), rCBV(ne): P < 0.001 versus rCBV(wm)). The highest values for mean SUVmax [0.89 (0.23-1.90)] and mean rCBV [2.1 (0.74-5.08)] were in the enhancing component, while the highest values for ADC [1780 mm(2)/s (863-2811)] were in the necrotic component. Conclusion(18)F-choline PET/MRI is able map imaging heterogeneity in paediatric and TYA gliomas, detecting post-treatment enhancing, non-enhancing, and necrotic tumour components equivalent to ADC and DSC-derived rCBV. This offers potential in the response assessment of diffuse non-enhancing gliomas and in selected cases such as posterior fossa tumours where quantitative MRI is technically difficult.

N2  -  A method for visualizing manifold-valued medical image data is proposed. The method operates on images in which each pixel is assumed to be sampled from an underlying manifold. For example, each pixel may contain a high dimensional vector, such as the time activity curve (TAC) in a dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) or a dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (dSPECT) image, or the positive semi-definite tensor in a diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image (DTMRI). A nonlinear mapping reduces the dimensionality of the pixel data to achieve two goals: distance preservation and embedding into a perceptual color space. We use multidimensional scaling distance-preserving mapping to render similar pixels (e.g., DT or TAC pixels) with perceptually similar colors. The 3D CIELAB perceptual color space is adopted as the range of the distance preserving mapping, with a final similarity transform mapping colors to a maximum gamut size. Similarity between pixels is either determined analytically as geodesics on the manifold of pixels or is approximated using manifold learning techniques. In particular, dissimilarity between DTMRI pixels is evaluated via a Log-Euclidean Riemannian metric respecting the manifold of the rank 3, second-order positive semi-definite DTs, whereas the dissimilarity between TACs is approximated via ISOMAP. We demonstrate our approach via artificial high-dimensional, manifold-valued data, as well as case studies of normal and pathological clinical brain and heart DTMRI, dPET, and dSPECT images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing, in a perceptually meaningful way, important features in the data.

N2  -  The healthy cerebral perfusion demonstrates a homogenous distribution of capillary transit times. A disruption of this homogeneity may inhibit the extraction of oxygen. A high degree of capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH) describes that some capillaries have very low blood flows, while others have excessively high blood flows and consequently short transit times. Very short transit times could hinder the oxygen extraction due to insufficient time for diffusion of oxygen into the tissue. CTH could be a consequence of cerebral vessel disease. We examined whether patients with cerebral steno-occlusive vessel disease demonstrate high CTH and if elevation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by administration of acetazolamide (ACZ) increases the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), or if some patients demonstrate reduced CMRO2 related to detrimental CTH. Thirty-four patients and thirty-one healthy controls participated. Global CBF and CMRO2 were acquired using phase-contrast MRI. Regional brain maps of CTH were acquired using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Patients with impaired cerebrovascular reserve capacity demonstrated elevated CTH and a significant reduction of CMRO2 after administration of ACZ, which could be related to high CTH. Impaired oxygen extraction from CTH could be a contributing part of the declining brain health observed in patients with cerebral vessel disease.

N2  -  The polarimetric techniques are used in various biomedical applications for a non-contact and fast diagnosis of tissue that is known as optical biopsy approach. These optical modalities provide relevant information on micro-architecture of biological tissue and its alterations induced by different diseases, thus, helping in staging and precise delineation of the pathology zones. In this review, we summarize the work of different research groups on using polarized light for brain tissue studies. This includes the investigations of polarimetric properties of brain tissue (both scattering and optical anisotropy) for brain connectome reconstruction, the visualization of in-plane brain fiber tracts for brain tumor contrast enhancement during neurosurgery, and the histopathology analysis for disease staging in Alzheimer's subjects. We discuss also further perspectives for the pre-clinical studies of brain with polarized light.

N2  -  The projection of the sensory nuclei of the thalamus upon the cerebral cortex was charted by analysis of retrograde degeneration in several hundred specimens with cortical lesions. The limits of the anatomic areas were compared with functional areas mapped by study of sensory defects following cortical lesions and found to correspond closely. The arrangement of axon terminations in the cortex reproduces accurately the arrangement of cells in each nucleus, with the exception of the medial geniculate. The topographic correspondence of differentiation within thalamic nuclei and their cortical areas is as precise for the olfactory as for any other sensory system. Topographic arrangement of fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus appears to be maintained in the radiation but is completely lost in the distribution of the fibers in area temporalis. Any lesion within the auditory cortex produces a uniform cell loss throughout the medial geniculate nucleus, proportionate to the destruction of the area. The precise topographic differentiation within the olfactory system and lack of differentiation in the auditory render current functional interpretations of anatomic projection of doubtful value. Parallel growth of fibers from the thalamic nuclei to the cortex will account for the topographic differentiation of the anterior and ventral nuclear groups but not for that of the lateral and medial geniculates.

N2  -  Both the size and location of injury in the brain influences the type and severity of cognitive or sensorimotor dysfunction. However, even with advances in MR imaging and analysis, the correspondence between lesion location and clinical deficit remains poorly understood. Here, structural and diffusion images from 14 healthy subjects are used to create spatially unbiased white matter connectivity importance maps that quantify the amount of disruption to the overall brain network that would be incurred if that region were compromised. Some regions in the white matter that were identified as highly important by such maps have been implicated in strategic infarct dementia and linked to various attention tasks in previous studies. Validation of the maps is performed by investigating the correlations of the importance maps' predicted cognitive deficits in a group of 15 traumatic brain injury patients with their cognitive test scores measuring attention and memory. While no correlation was found between amount of white matter injury and cognitive test scores, significant correlations (r>0.68, p <0.006) were found when including location information contained in the importance maps. These tools could be used by physicians to improve surgical planning, diagnosis, and assessment of disease severity in a variety of pathologies like multiple sclerosis, trauma, and stroke.

T2  -  CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING REVIEWS

N2  -  Surgery is currently the first treatment for low-grade gliomas (LGG). However, LGG often involves eloquent areas, in patients with no or mild preoperative deficit. Therefore, cortical and subcortical structures, essential, for brain functions must be preserved. Presurgical functional neuroimaging and tractography can show the relationships between eloquent regions and the tumor, but they have several limitations. Consequently, intraoperative electrical mapping is more and more used by neurosurgeons, to tailor the resection according to individual functional boundaries. Nonetheless, due to the invasive feature of LGG, the glioma removal is regularly incomplete to avoid postsurgical permanent deficit. The goal of this review is to provide new insights into cerebral plasticity, that is, the brains ability to reorganize its functional maps consecutively to slow-growing lesions like LGG. Longitudinal studies combining pre-, intra-and post-operative brain mapping methods may enable to analyze functional redistribution over time at the individual scale. Such plastic potential can open the door to multiple surgeries spaced by several months or years, with the aim to optimize the benefit/risk ratio of surgery, i.e. to increase the extent of resection of LGG before anaplastic transformation - thus to increase the overall survival - while preserving and even improving the quality of life.

N2  -  PurposeThe extent of resection (EOR) is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in adult patients with Glioma Grade 4 (GG4). The aim of the neuro-oncology section of the Italian Society of Neurosurgery (SINch (R)) was to provide a general overview of the current trends and technical tools to reach this goal.MethodsA systematic review was performed. The results were divided and ordered, by an expert team of surgeons, to assess the Class of Evidence (CE) and Strength of Recommendation (SR) of perioperative drugs management, imaging, surgery, intraoperative imaging, estimation of EOR, surgery at tumor progression and surgery in elderly patients.ResultsA total of 352 studies were identified, including 299 retrospective studies and 53 reviews/meta-analysis. The use of Dexamethasone and the avoidance of prophylaxis with anti-seizure medications reached a CE I and SR A. A preoperative imaging standard protocol was defined with CE II and SR B and usefulness of an early postoperative MRI, with CE II and SR B. The EOR was defined the strongest independent risk factor for both OS and tumor recurrence with CE II and SR B. For intraoperative imaging only the use of 5-ALA reached a CE II and SR B. The estimation of EOR was established to be fundamental in planning postoperative adjuvant treatments with CE II and SR B and the stereotactic image-guided brain biopsy to be the procedure of choice when an extensive surgical resection is not feasible (CE II and SR B).ConclusionsA growing number of evidences evidence support the role of maximal safe resection as primary OS predictor in GG4 patients. The ongoing development of intraoperative techniques for a precise real-time identification of peritumoral functional pathways enables surgeons to maximize EOR minimizing the post-operative morbidity.

N2  -  Intracranial peripherally enhancing lesions in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients represent a unique diagnostic and management dilemma due to the vast array of differentials that demand consideration. Diagnosis of the underlying pathology is often guided by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present the first published case series of three cardiac transplant recipients with significantly atypical neuroradiological findings contrary to the tenets of contemporary literature. Our rare case series consists of: (1) A sterile Mycobacterium pyogenic abscess mimicking glioblastoma multiforme due to an immunosuppressed state (2) Epstein Barr Virus encephalitis masquerading as Central Nervous System Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (3) An unusual case of partially treated disseminated Nocardiosis warning of the need to consider the immunosuppressed state and partial treatment response obfuscating classical MRI appearances. We utilise these unprecedented cases as the basis of a literature review to understand the pathophysiology behind the peculiar imaging findings in this rarefied cohort of transplant recipients, and rationalise why the MRI findings in each instance contradicts the accepted imaging patterns. In the setting of potential unreliability of neuroradiology in this immunosuppressed unique subgroup, we hope to impart to clinicians that definitive diagnosis obtained by emergent neurosurgical intervention may be necessary to accurately and expediently guide further medical management.

N2  -  Bevacizumab shows unprecedented rates of response in recurrent glioblastomas (GBM), but the detailed mechanisms are still unclear. We employed in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether bevacizumab alters oxygen and energy metabolism and whether this effect has antitumoral activity in recurrent GBM. P-31 and H-1 MRSI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and high-resolution T2 and T2' mapping (indirect marker of oxygen extraction) were investigated in 16 patients with recurrent GBM at 3 Tesla before and 1.5-2 months after initiation of therapy with bevacizumab. Changes of metabolite concentrations and of the quantitative values in the tumor and normal appearing brain tissue were calculated. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to evaluate differences for tumor/edema versus control as well as changes before versus after commencement of therapy. Survival analyses were performed for significant parameters. Tumor T2', pH, ADC, and T2 decreased significantly in patients responding to bevacizumab therapy (n = 10). Patients with at least 25% T2' decrease during treatment showed longer progression-free and overall survival durations. Levels of high-energy metabolites were lower at baseline; these persisted under therapy. Glycerophosphoethanolamine as catabolic phospholipid metabolite increased in responders. The MRSI data support the hypothesis that bevacizumab induces relative tumor hypoxia (T2' decrease) and affects energy homeostasis in recurrent GBM, suggesting that bevacizumab impairs vascular function. The antiangiogenic effect of bevacizumab is predictive of better outcome and seems to induce antitumoral activity in the responding GBMs.

N2  -  A novel manifold learning approach is presented to efficiently identify low-dimensional structures embedded in high-dimensional MRI data sets. These low-dimensional structures, known as manifolds, are used in this study for predicting brain tumor progression. The data sets consist of a series of high-dimensional MRI scans for four patients with tumor and progressed regions identified. We attempt to classify tumor, progressed and normal tissues in low-dimensional space. We also attempt to verify if a progression manifold exists-the bridge between tumor and normal manifolds. By identifying and mapping the bridge manifold back to MRI image space, this method has the potential to predict tumor progression. This could be greatly beneficial for patient management. Preliminary results have supported our hypothesis: normal and tumor manifolds are well separated in a low-dimensional space. Also, the progressed manifold is found to lie roughly between the normal and tumor manifolds.

N2  -  Background and Objectives
Disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and epileptic seizures are associated with poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Our objective was to identify the distribution of diffusion MRI-measured anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest and to define the regional correlates of disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures.; Methods; We analyzed patients from a single-center database of unresponsive patients who underwent diffusion MRI after cardiac arrest (n = 204). We classified each patient according to recovery of consciousness (command following) before discharge, the most continuous EEG background (burst suppression vs continuous), and the presence or absence of seizures. Anoxic brain injury was measured with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) signal. We identified ADC abnormalities relative to controls without cardiac arrest (n = 48) and used voxel lesion symptom mapping to identify regional associations with disorders of consciousness, EEG background suppression, and seizures. We then used a bootstrapped lasso regression procedure to identify robust, multivariate regional associations with each outcome variable. Last, using area under receiver operating characteristic curves, we then compared the classification ability of the strongest regional associations to that of brain-wide summary measures.; Results; Compared to controls, patients with cardiac arrest demonstrated ADC signal reduction that was most significant in the occipital lobes. Disorders of consciousness were associated with reduced ADC most prominently in the occipital lobes but also in deep structures. Regional injury more accurately classified patients with disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury. Background suppression mapped to a similar set of brain regions, but regional injury could no better classify patients than whole-brain measures. Seizures were less common in patients with more severe anoxic injury, particularly in those with injury to the lateral temporal white matter.; Discussion; Anoxic brain injury was most prevalent in posterior cerebral regions, and this regional pattern of injury was a better predictor of disorders of consciousness than whole-brain injury measures. EEG background suppression lacked a specific regional association, but patients with injury to the temporal lobe were less likely to have seizures. Regional patterns of anoxic brain injury are relevant to the clinical and electrographic sequelae of cardiac arrest and may hold importance for prognosis.; Classification of Evidence; This study provides Class IV evidence that disorders of consciousness after cardiac arrest are associated with widely lower ADC values on diffusion MRI and are most strongly associated with reductions in occipital ADC.

N2  -  An endovascular model of focal brain ischemia in rats with controlled duration of reperfusion of I h has been studied. The reliability of experimental model for localization and volume of ischemic lesion (basal ganglia, hippocampus, parietal-temporal regions; the volume of lesion focus on MRI T2-weighted image (T2-WI) in the first day after brain ischemia 146,4 +/- 44,7 mm3) has been worked out. We conducted the clinical monitoring including assessment of neurological deficit, behavioral tests and performed MRI of the brain on 1st, 5th and 10-17th days after the occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA), including regimes of diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and T2-WI, and carried out a histological study of the brain. The regress of neurological deficit was seen on the 14(th) day after surgery. Behavioral tests revealed the reduction of movement activity of animals in the case group 7 days after the MCA occlusion. Compared to the first day after surgery, the decrease of volume lesion focus on DWI and T2-WI was observed on the 5(th) day (p<0,05) as well, with the following decrease to the 10-14(th) days. The histological picture in the lesion foci corresponded to the brain infarction on the 5(th) and 14(th) days after surgery.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a clinically feasible approach to diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI of the prostate without susceptibility-induced artifacts. The proposed method relies on an undersampled multi-shot DW turbo-STEAM sequence with rotated radial trajectories and a multi-step inverse reconstruction with denoised multi-shot phase maps. The total acquisition time was below 6 min for a resolution of 1.4 x 1.4 x 3.5 mm(3) and six directions at b = 600 s mm(-2). Studies of eight healthy subjects and two patients with prostate cancer were performed at 3 T employing an 18-channel body-array coil and elements of the spine coil. The method was compared with conventional DW echo-planar imaging (EPI) of the prostate. The results confirm that DW STEAM MRI avoids geometric distortions and false image intensities, which were present for both single-shot EPI (ssEPI) and readout-segmented EPI, particularly near the intestinal wall of the prostate. Quantitative accuracy of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was validated with use of a numerical phantom providing ground truth. ADC values in the central prostate gland of healthy subjects were consistent with those measured using ssEPI and with literature data. Preliminary results for patients with prostate cancer revealed a correct anatomical localization of lesions with respect to T-2-weighted MRI in both mean DW STEAM images and ADC maps. In summary, DW STEAM MRI of the prostate offers clinically relevant advantages for the diagnosis of prostate cancer compared with state-of-the-art EPI-based approaches. The method warrants extended clinical trials.

N2  -  Background and Purpose
In the treatment of patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, increasing evidence suggests the importance of measuring the volume of the irreversibly injured "ischemic core." The gold standard method for doing this in the clinical setting is diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), but many authors suggest that maps of regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) derived from computed tomography perfusion imaging (CTP) can substitute for DWI. We sought to determine whether DWI and CTP-derived CBV maps are equivalent in measuring core volume.; Methods; 58 patients with suspected stroke underwent CTP and DWI within 6 hours of symptom onset. We measured low-CBV lesion volumes using three methods: "objective absolute," i.e. the volume of tissue with CBV below each of six published absolute thresholds (0.9-2.5 mL100 g), "objective relative," whose six thresholds (51%-60%) were fractions of mean contralateral CBV, and "subjective," in which two radiologists (R1, R2) outlined lesions subjectively. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of each method, threshold, and radiologist in detecting infarction, and the degree to which each over-or underestimated the DWI core volume. Additionally, in the subset of 32 patients for whom follow-up CT or MRI was available, we measured the proportion of CBV- or DWI-defined core lesions that exceeded the follow-up infarct volume, and the maximum amount by which this occurred.; Results; DWI was positive in 72% (4258) of patients. CBV maps' sensitivityspecificity in identifying DWI-positive patients were 100%0% for both objective methods with all thresholds, 43%94% for R1, and 83%44% for R2. Mean core overestimation was 156-699 mL for objective absolute thresholds, and 127-200 mL for objective relative thresholds. For R1 and R2, respectively, mean +- SD subjective overestimation were -11 +- 26 mL and -11 +- 23 mL, but subjective volumes differed from DWI volumes by up to 117 and 124 mL in individual patients. Inter-rater agreement regarding the presence of infarction on CBV maps was poor (kappa = 0.21). Core lesions defined by the six objective absolute CBV thresholds exceeded followup infarct volumes for 81%-100% of patients, by up to 430-1002 mL. Core estimates produced by objective relative thresholds exceeded follow-up volumes in 91% of patients, by up to 210-280 mL. Subjective lesions defined by R1 and R2 exceeded follow-up volumes in 18% and 26% of cases, by up to 71 and 15 mL, respectively. Only 1 of 23 DWI lesions (4%) exceeded final infarct volume, by 3 mL.; Conclusion; CTP-derived CBV maps cannot reliably substitute for DWI in measuring core volume, or even establish which patients have DWI lesions.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: The accurate delineation of tumor recurrence and its differentiation from radiation injury in the follow-up of adjuvantly treated high-grade gliomas presents a significant problem in neuro-oncology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to distinguish recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients who were being treated for glial neoplasms underwent prospectively conventional and DCE-MRI using a 3T scanner. The pharmacokinetic modelling was based on a two-compartment model that allows for the calculation of K-trans (transfer constant between intra- and extravascular, extracellular space), v(e) (extravascular, extracellular space), k(ep) (transfer constant from the extracellular, extravascular Space into the plasma), and iAUC (initial area under the signal intensity-time curve). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the entire recurrence-suspected contrast-enhanced region. A definitive diagnosis was established at subsequent surgical resection or clinicoradiologic follow-up. The hemodynamic parameters in the contralateral normal white matter, the radiation injury sites, and the tumor recurrent lesions were compared using nonparametric tests.; Results: The K-trans, v(e), k(ep), and iAUC values in the normal white matter were significantly different than those in the radiation necrosis and recurrent gliomas (0.01, < P < .0001). The only significantly different hemodynamic parameter between the recurrent tumor lesions and the radiation-induced necrotic sites were K-trans and iAUC, which were significantly higher in the recurrent glioma group than in the radiation necrosis group (P <= .0184). A K-trans cutoff value higher than 0.19 showed 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity for detecting the recurrent gliomas, whereas an iAUC cutoff value higher than 15.35 had 71% sensitivity and 71% specificity. The v(e) and k(ep) values in recurrent tumors were lot significantly higher than those in radiation-induced necrotic lesions.; Conclusions: These findings suggest that DCE-MRI may be used to distinguish between recurrent gliomas and radiation injury and thus, assist in follow-up patient management strategy.

N2  -  PurposeWe propose a new generalized diffusion tensor imaging (GDTI) experimental design and analysis framework for efficiently measuring orientationally averaged diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), which remove bulk signal modulations attributed to diffusion anisotropy and quantify isotropic higher-order diffusion tensors (HOT). We illustrate how this framework accelerates the clinical measurement of rotation-invariant tissue microstructural parameters derived from HOT, such as the HOT-Trace and the mean t-kurtosis.
Theory and MethodsFor a large range of b-values, we compare orientationally averaged DWIs measured with high angular resolution diffusion imaging to those obtained with the proposed isotropic GDTI (IGDTI) experimental design. We compare rotation-invariant microstructural parameters measured with IGDTI to those derived from HOTs measured explicitly with GDTI.; ResultsIn both fixed-brain microimaging and in vivo clinical experiments, IGDTI accurately quantifies mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC)-weighted DWIs over a wide range of b-values and allows efficient computation of HOT-derived scalar tissue parameters from a small number of DWIs.; ConclusionsIGDTI provides direct and accurate estimates of orientationally averaged tissue water mobilities over a wide range of b-values. This efficient method may enable new, sensitive, and quantitative assessments for clinical applications in which changes in mADC can be observe,d such as detecting and characterizing stroke, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases.

N2  -  Track-Weighted Imaging (TWO, where voxel intensity is based on image metrics encoded along streamline trajectories, provides a mechanism to study white matter disease. However, with generalised streamline weighting, it is difficult to localise the precise anatomical source and spread of injury or neuropathology. This limitation can be overcome by modulating the voxel weight based on the distance of the voxel from a given anatomical location along the tract, which we term diTWI: distance informed Track-Weighted Imaging. The location of known neuropathology can be delineated on any given imaging modality (e.g. MRI or PET). To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we measured tumour cell infiltration along WM fibre tracts in 13 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and 1 patient with Anaplastic Astrocytoma. TWI and diTWI maps were generated using information obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (area under the curve, AUC) and diffusivity maps (ADC and. FA) with tumour boundaries automatically extracted using a logistic regression classifier. The accuracy of the derived tumour volumes was compared to those generated using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[F-18]-fluorot-phenylalanine (FDOPA) PET imaging. The accuracy of the tumour volumes generated from the diTWI maps was superior to volumes derived from the TWI, geometric distance or baseline AUC, FA and ADC maps. The relative overlap and relative dissimilarity rates for the diTWI generated tumour volumes after classification were found to be 823 +/- 153% (range 69.1-91.9) and 16.9 +/- 8.8% (range 7.9-37.5), respectively. These findings show that diTWI maps provide a useful framework for localising neuropathological processes occurring along WM pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECT Subcortical stimulation is a method used to evaluate the distance from the stimulation site to the corticospinal tract (CST) and to decide whether the resection of an adjacent lesion should be terminated to prevent damage to the CST. However, the correlation between stimulation intensity and distance to the CST has not yet been clearly assessed. The objective of this study was to investigate the appropriate correlation between the subcortical stimulation pattern and the distance to the CST.
METHODS Monopolar subcortical motor evoked potential (MEP) mapping was performed in addition to continuous MEP monitoring in 37 consecutive patients with lesions located in motor-eloquent locations. The proximity of the resection cavity to the CST was identified by subcortical MEP mapping. At the end of resection, the point at which an MEP response was still measurable with minimal subcortical MEP intensity was marked with a titanium clip. At this location, different stimulation paradigms were executed with cathodal or anodel stimulation at 0.3-, 0.5-, and 0.7-msec pulse durations. Postoperatively, the distance between the CST as defined by postoperative diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking and the titanium clip was measured. The correlation between this distance and the subcortical MEP electrical charge was calculated.; RESULTS Subcortical MEP mapping was successful in all patients. There were no new permanent motor deficits. Transient new postoperative motor deficits were observed in 14% (536) of cases. Gross-total resection was achieved in 75% (2736) and subtotal resection (>80% of tumor mass) in 25% (936) of cases. Stimulation intensity with various pulse durations as well as current intensity was plotted against the measured distance between the CST and the titanium clip on postoperative MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging fiberitracking tractography. Correlational and regression analyses showed a nonlinear correlation between stimulation intensity and the distance to the CST. Cathodal stimulation appeared better suited for subcortical stimulation.; CONCLUSIONS Subcortical MEP mapping is an excellent intraoperative method to determine the distance to the CST during resection of motor-eloquent lesions and is highly capable of further reducing the risk of a new neurological deficit.

N2  -  Purpose: Reperfusion therapy enables effective treatment of ischemic stroke presenting within 4-6 hours. However, tissue progression from ischemia to infarction is variable, and some patients benefit from treatment up until 24 hours. Improved imaging techniques are needed to identify these patients. Here, it was hypothesized that time dependence in diffusion MRI may predict tissue outcome in ischemic stroke.
Methods: Diffusion MRI data were acquired with multiple diffusion times in five non-reperfused patients at 2, 9, and 100 days after stroke onset. Maps of "rate of kurtosis change" (k), mean kurtosis, ADC, and fractional anisotropy were derived. The ADC maps defined lesions, normal-appearing tissue, and the lesion tissue that would either be infarcted or remain viable by day 100. Diffusion parameters were compared (1) between lesions and normal-appearing tissue, and (2) between lesion tissue that would be infarcted or remain viable.; Results: Positive values of k were observed within stroke lesions on day 2 (P=.001) and on day 9 (P=.023), indicating diffusional exchange. On day 100, high ADC values indicated infarction of 50 +- 20% of the lesion volumes. Tissue infarction was predicted by high k values both on day 2 (P=.026) and on day 9 (P=.046), by low mean kurtosis values on day 2 (P=.043), and by low fractional anisotropy values on day 9 (P=.029), but not by low ADC values.; Conclusions: Diffusion time dependence predicted tissue outcome in ischemic stroke more accurately than the ADC, and may be useful for predicting reperfusion benefit.

N2  -  Purpose: Thromboembolic stroke models in animals closely simulate human embolic stroke, However, great intrinsic variability in the size of the ischemic lesions that are produced makes evaluation of the success of later therapies difficult. Diffusion and perfusion MRI can be employed to assess the size, and subsequent status, of experimental and clinical stroke subjects undergoing thrombolytic therapy,
Methods: Beginning 30 minutes after embolization of the middle cerebral artery territory with autologous clot, 15 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to treatment with a 30-minute infusion of either t-PA or saline, Serial, whole-brain, diffusion-weighted mapping studies were performed before, during, and after the t-PA (or saline) infusion to quantitatively identify the ischemic region. Bolus tracking perfusion imaging with gadolinium trimeglumine was performed before clot injection, just before treatment, and 30 minutes after the t-PA infusion, Infarction volume at 24 hours after embolization was calculated using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, Animals with pre-treatment ischemic lesion volumes less than 100 mm(3) were excluded to reduce the variability of the model,; Results: The volume of the ischemic lesion showed no statistically significant difference in the t-PA group as compared to controls (n = 7 per group), When one control animal with spontaneous reperfusion was excluded, the diffusion imaging studies showed a significantly smaller ischemic lesion volume in the t-PA group at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after embolization (P < .05). Perfusion imaging documented reduced flow before treatment in all animals, improvement after treatment in four of seven t-PA animals, and spontaneous reperfusion in one control animal,; Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that diffusion and perfusion imaging can be used to evaluate thrombolytic therapy in a thromboembolic stroke model in vivo.

N2  -  Background. Although glioblastomas are heterogeneous brain-infiltrating tumors, their treatment is mostly focused on the contrast-enhancing tumor mass. In this study, we combined conventional MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and amino acid PET to explore imaging-defined glioblastoma subregions and evaluate their potential prognostic value.
Methods. Contrast-enhancedT1,T2fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps from DWI, and alpha-C-11-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-PET images were analyzed in 30 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Five tumor subregions were identified based on a combination of MRI contrast enhancement, T2FLAIR signal abnormalities, and AMT uptake on PET. ADC and AMT uptake tumorcontralateral normal cortex (TN) ratios in these tumor subregions were correlated, and their prognostic value was determined.; Results. A total of 115 MRIPET-defined subregions were analyzed. Most tumors showed not only a high-AMT uptake (TN ratio > 1.65, N = 27) but also a low-uptake subregion (N = 21) within the contrast-enhancing tumor mass. High AMT uptake extending beyond contrast enhancement was also common (N = 25) and was associated with low ADC (r= -0.40, P. 0.05). Higher AMT uptake in the contrast-enhancing tumor subregions was strongly prognostic for overall survival (hazard ratio: 7.83; 95% CI: 1.98-31.02, P= 0.003), independent of clinical and molecular genetic prognostic variables. Nonresected high-AMT uptake subregions predicted the sites of tumor progression on posttreatment PET performed in 10 patients.; Conclusions. Glioblastomas show heterogeneous amino acid uptake with high-uptake regions often extending into non-enhancing brain with high cellularity; nonresection of these predict the site of posttreatment progression. High tryptophan uptake values in MRI contrast-enhancing tumor subregions are a strong, independent imaging marker for longer overall survival.

N2  -  Background: The Canadian Special Operations Forces Command conducts explosives operations and training which exposes members to explosive charges at close proximity. This 5-year longitudinal trial was conducted in follow-up to our initial trial which examined military breachers with MRI and EEG pre and post blast exposure. Purpose: To examine brain MRI findings in military personnel exposed to multiple repeated blast exposures. Study Type: Five-year longitudinal prospective trial. Population: Ninety-two males aged 23-42 with an average of 9.4 years of blast exposure. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T brain MRI/T1-weighted 3D with reconstruction in three planes, T2-weighted, T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 3D with reconstruction in three planes, T2-weighted gradient spin echo (GRE), saturation weighted images, DWI and ADC maps, diffusion tensor imaging. Assessment: All MRI scans were interpreted by the two neuroradiologists and one neuroradiology Fellow in a blinded fashion using a customized neuroradiology reporting form. Statistical Tests: Matching parametric statistics represented the number of participants whose brain parameters improved or deteriorated over time. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using log regression modeling to determine volume loss, white matter lesions, hemosiderosis, gliosis, cystic changes and enlarged Virchow Robin (VR) spaces. A Kappa (kappa) statistic with a 95% CI was calculated to determine rater variability between readers. Results: A significant deterioration was observed in volume loss (OR = 1.083, 95% CI 0.678-1.731, permutation test), white matter changes (OR: 0.754, 95% CI 0.442-1.284, permutation test), and enlargement of VR spaces (OR: 0.775, 95% CI 0.513-1.171). Interrater reliability was low: kappa = 0.283, 0.156, and 0.557 for volume loss, white matter changes, and enlargement of VR spaces, respectively. Data Conclusion: There were significant changes in brain volume, white matter lesions, and enlargement of VR spaces. Evidence Level2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is an aggressive and highly infiltrative brain cancer. Standard surgical resection is guided by enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted (T1) magnetic resonance imaging, which is insufficient for delineating surrounding infiltrating tumor.
OBJECTIVE: To develop imaging biomarkers that delineate areas of tumor infiltration and predict early recurrence in peritumoral tissue. Such markers would enable intensive, yet targeted, surgery and radiotherapy, thereby potentially delaying recurrence and prolonging survival.; METHODS: Preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance images (T1, T1-gadolinium, T2-weighted, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging, and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images) from 31 patients were combined using machine learning methods, thereby creating predictive spatial maps of infiltrated peritumoral tissue. Cross-validation was used in the retrospective cohort to achieve generalizable biomarkers. Subsequently, the imaging signatures learned from the retrospective study were used in a replication cohort of 34 new patients. Spatial maps representing the likelihood of tumor infiltration and future early recurrence were compared with regions of recurrence on postresection follow-up studies with pathology confirmation.; RESULTS: This technique produced predictions of early recurrence with a mean area under the curve of 0.84, sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 93%, and odds ratio estimates of 9.29 (99% confidence interval: 8.95-9.65) for tissue predicted to be heavily infiltrated in the replication study. Regions of tumor recurrence were found to have subtle, yet fairly distinctive multiparametric imaging signatures when analyzed quantitatively by pattern analysis and machine learning.; CONCLUSION: Visually imperceptible imaging patterns discovered via multiparametric pattern analysis methods were found to estimate the extent of infiltration and location of future tumor recurrence, paving the way for improved targeted treatment.

N2  -  Investigative strategies for partial epilepsy have evolved greatly since the advent of morphological MRI. MRI currently provides the most extensive and sensitive information for detecting and localizing brain anomalies. Technical progress has included new sequences (3D acquisition, inversion-recovery, fast spin-echo), new imaging planes (through the greater diameter of the hippocampus for temporal epilepsy, orbitao-meatal for extra-temporal epilepsy), high-resolution imaging, and better signal-noise ratio in addition to new procedurs such as NMR spectroscopy, diffusion/perfusion imaging, or functional MRI.
One of the principal aims of MRI is to detect potentially epileptogenic brain anomalies useful for the detection and localization of the epileptic focus. MRI sensitivity is much greater than brain computed tomography, which excepting specific cases, is no longer contributive. Hippocampal sclerosis is atypical example of an epsilepsy-related brain anomaly (mesial temporal lobe epilepsy) whose diagnosis has been changed by MRI. This entity was described by Bouchet and Cazauvieilh in 1825 who related anatomic postmortem findings to the clinical expression. Reliable diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis can now be achieved with MRI, contributing to the diagnosis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. MRI can also contribute precious prognostic information, useful for both drug and surgical treatment. It has been demonstrated that the degree of response to drug treatment is not univocal and that certain lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis are generally associated with drug resistance. Sensitivity to drug therapy also varies with the type of cerebral dysgenesia. It has also been demonstrated that the a brain lesion identified at MRI is generally a factor of good prognosis after surgery.; Continuing improvements in MRI techniques, widespread availability of technical facilities and new derived techniques contribute greatly to the usefulness of MRI for investigating partial epilepsy.

N2  -  Purpose: To retrospectively assess the incremental value of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map combined with T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images compared with T2-weighted images alone for prostate cancer detection by using a pathologic map as the reference standard.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was waived. The study included 52 patients (mean age, 65 years +- 5 standard deviation; range, 48-76 years) who underwent endorectal MR imaging and step-section histologic examination. Three readers with varying experience levels reviewed T2-weighted images alone, the ADC map alone, and T2-weighted images and ADC maps. The prostate was divided into 12 segments. The probability of prostate cancer in each segment on MR images was recorded with a five-point scale. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were compared by using the Z test; sensitivity and specificity were determined with the Z test after adjusting for data clustering.; Results: AUC of T2-weighted and ADC data (reader 1, 0.90; reader 2, 0.88; reader 3, 0.76) was greater than that of T2-weighted images (reader 1, 0.79; reader 2, 0.75; reader 3, 0.66) for all readers (P <.0001 in all comparisons). AUC of T2-weighted and ADC data was greater for readers 1 and 2 than for reader 3 (P <.001). Sensitivity of T2-weighted and ADC data (reader 1, 88%; reader 2, 81%; and reader 3, 78%) was greater than that of T2-weighted images (reader 1, 74%; reader 2, 67%; reader 3, 67%) for all readers (P=.01 for reader 1; P=.02 for readers 2 and 3). Specificity of T2-weighted and ADC data was greater than that of T2-weighted images for reader 1 (88% vs 79%, P=.03) and reader 2 (89% vs 77%, P <.001).; Conclusion: The addition of an ADC map to T2-weighted images can improve the diagnostic performance of MR imaging in prostate cancer detection.

N2  -  A subset of patients with high-grade glioma and brain metastases who are treated with bevacizumab develop regions of marked and persistent restricted diffusion that do not reflect recurrent tumor. Here, we quantify the degree of restricted diffusion and the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) within these regions of bevacizumab-related imaging abnormality (BRIA) in order to facilitate differentiation of these lesions from recurrent tumor. Six patients with high-grade glioma and two patients with brain metastases who developed regions of restricted diffusion after initiation of bevacizumab were included. Six pre-treatment GBM controls were also included. Restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) was used to create diffusion maps which were co-registered with rCBV maps. Within regions of restricted diffusion, mean RSI values and mean rCBV values were calculated for patients with BRIA and for the GBM controls. These values were also calculated for normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). RSI values in regions of restricted diffusion were higher for both BRIA and tumor when compared to NAWM; furthermore RSI values in BRIA were slightly higher than in tumor. Conversely, rCBV values were very low in BRIA-lower than both tumor and NAWM. However, there was only a trend for rCBV values to be higher in tumor than in NAWM. When evaluating areas of restricted diffusion in patients with high-grade glioma or brain metastases treated with bevacizumab, RSI is better able to detect the presence of pathology whereas rCBV is better able to differentiate BRIA from tumor. Thus, combining these tools may help to differentiate necrotic tissue related to bevacizumab treatment from recurrent tumor.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively perform a direct measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in cortical lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant; informed consent was obtained. Magnetic resonance (MR) images, including double inversion-recovery (DIE), phase-sensitive inversion-recovery (PSIR), and diffusion-tensor images, were acquired from nine MS patients with cortical lesions (five women, four men; median age, 47 years) and nine age- and sex- matched volunteer control subjects. Following nonlinear elastically constrained image registration for aligning diffusion-weighted images to DIR images, maps of,FA and MD were computed for each Subject. Cortical lesions were identified on DIR images and validated by using PSIR images. The diffusion-tensor imaging maps were then over- laid on the coregistered DIR images, and mean FA and MD values were measured in regions of interest drawn on the cortical lesions. Differences between normal gray matter (GM) and cortical lesions were evaluated by using the generalized estimating equation. FA and MD histograms of whole brain and GM (global analysis) in healthy control subjects and MS patients were also computed for comparision with those in previously published studies.; Results: FA and MD values were significantly higher in cortical lesions compared with similar regions in healthy control subjects. Histogram. peak FA was significantly decreased and peak MD was significantly increased in patients relative to con trol subjects.; Conclusion: DIR and PSIR combined with nonlinear image registration allowed direct focal measurement of FA and MD in cortical lesions.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate in detail the effect of gadolinium contrast on diffusion tensor imaging scans. As the present literature offers conflicting results, we have included a large selection of indices in the analysis.
Materials and methods: Sixteen patients harboring an intra-axial contrast enhancing brain tumor were included in this study. Two diffusion tensor imaging scans were performed-one natively, and the second following a gadolinium contrast agent application. Maps of the invariant indices fractional anisotropy (FA), linear, planar, and spherical indices, trace, eigenvalues lambda(1), lambda(2), lambda(3) as well as of the components of the diffusion tensor matrix Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz and Dyz were co-registered and compared statistically with matching ROI pairs in the contrast enhancing areas, peritumoral edema and the normal appearing white matter.; Results: We have observed a significant increase in the FA and disproportional decrease of the eigenvalues in the post-contrast scans. In accordance with these findings, the spherical index was decreased and the linear and planar indices were increased. There was a significant decrease of all diagonal components of the diffusion tensor matrix. These changes have been strongest in the contrast enhancing areas, but there were also significant changes in the peritumoral edema and the normal appearing white matter.; Conclusion: Diffusion tensor imaging scans performed after gadolinium contrast agent administration may display artificially increased FA values due to disproportional changes of the measured eigenvalues. The distortion of the diffusion measurement is strongest in, but not limited to the contrasting areas. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is characterised by benign hamartomatous lesions in many organs. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect microstructural changes in pathological processes. Objective: To determine apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps in children with TS and to investigate the diffusion properties in cortical tubers, white-matter lesions, perilesional white matter, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter, and to compare the results with ADC and FA maps of normal age- and sex-matched volunteers. Materials and methods: Seven children and adolescents (age range 2-20 years) suffering from TS were included. MRI was performed on a 1.5-T scanner using a transmit/receive coil with T1-W and T2-W spin-echo and FLAIR sequences. DT images were acquired by using a single-shot echo-planar pulse sequence. Diffusion gradients were applied in six different directions with a b value of 1,000 s/mm(2). Results: ADC was higher in cortical tubers than in the corresponding cortical location of controls. ADC values were higher and FA values were lower in white-matter lesions and perilesional white matter than in both the contralateral normal-appearing white matter of patients and in controls. There were no significant differences for both ADC and FA values in the normal-appearing white matter of patients with TS compared to controls. Conclusions: DTI provides important information about cortical tubers, white-matter abnormalities, and perilesional white matter in patients with TS.

N2  -  Purpose: To explore the role of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps based on entire tumor volume data in determining glioma grade and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ADC maps at standard (1000 sec/mm(2)) and high (3000 sec/mm(2)) b values.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Twenty-seven patients with astrocytic tumors underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with b values of 1000 and 3000 secmm(2), and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated (ADC(1000) and ADC(3000), respectively). Regions of interest containing the lesion were drawn on every section of the ADC map containing the tumor and were summated to derive volume-based data of the entire tumor. Histogram parameters were correlated with tumor grade by using repeated measurements analysis of variance, the Tukey-Kramer test for post hoc comparisons, and an unpaired Student t test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the optimum threshold for each histogram parameter, and sensitivity and specificity were assessed.; Results: Minimum ADC(1000) and ADC(3000) both decreased with increasing tumor grade. The 50th and 75th percentiles of cumulative ADC(1000) histograms showed significant differences between grades (P = .015 and .001, respectively), while the fifth and 75th percentiles of cumulative ADC(3000) histograms showed such differences (P = .015 and .014, respectively). Minimum ADC and the fifth percentile for both ADC(1000) (P < .001 and P = .024, respectively) and ADC(3000) (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively) proved to lie significant histogram parameters for differentiating high-from low-grade gliomas. The diagnostic value of the parameters derived from ADC(1000) and ADC(3000) were compared, and a significant difference (0.202, P = .014) was found between the areas under the ROC curve of the fifth percentiles for ADC(1000) and ADC(3000).; Conclusion: Histogram analysis of ADC maps based on entire tumor volume can be a useful tool for grading gliomas. The fifth percentile of the cumulative ADC histogram obtained at a high b value was the most promising parameter for differentiating high- from low-grade gliomas. (C) RSNA, 2011

N2  -  We present the morphology and the laminar distribution of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) innervation of the cerebral cortex of patients who underwent cortical resection for partial seizures, The limits of the resections were established by stereoelectroencephalography. The 5-HT innervation was mapped by using an antiserum anti-5-HT. Two patients had cryptogenic epilepsies and two others had seizures related to focal cortical dysplasia. 5-HT immunoreactive axons were morphologically heterogeneous and projected diffusely to the cerebral cortex with regional-specific densities, Two types of terminal axon were demonstrated. Type I had large and spherical (intensely immunoreactive) varicosities and was distributed sparsely with a characteristic predominance in the molecular layer, Type II had fine and pleiomorphic varicosities (granular or fusiform) and was distributed through all cortical layers. The distribution of the 5-HT innervation varied according to the different architectonic areas investigated. The granular cortical areas characterized by a highly developed layer IV (primary somatosensory, primary visual and prefrontal cortices) had the highest density of 5-HT-ir fibers distributed from layer I to layer V. The agranular primary motor cortex had the lowest density with fibers preferentially seen in layers I, IIIa and V-VI. The orbital cortex with a poorly defined layer IV had an intermediate density with a laminar repartition predominant in the supragranular layers. In patients with cryptogenic epilepsies, the brain epileptogenic tissue was histologically normal as well as the serotonergic innervation. In contrast, in patients with focal cortical dysplasia, the dysplastic epileptogenic tissue was characterized by a serotonergic hyperinnervation. In agreement with previous data in primates, we give morphological evidence for two morphologically distinct serotonergic subsystems and for regional-specific densities in the human cerebral cortex. Moreover, we previously reported an altered pattern of the catecholaminergic innervation in the same dysplasia areas. All these results provide evidence that this developmental epileptogenic lesion involves several sets of neurons which may contribute to epileptogenic activity.

N2  -  Standard MRI cannot distinguish between radiation necrosis and tumor progression; however, this distinction is critical in the assessment of tumor response to therapy. In this study, one delayed radiation necrosis model (dose, 40 Gy; radiation field, 10 x 10 mm(2); n = 13) and two orthotopic glioma models in rats (9L gliosarcoma, n =8; human glioma xenografts, n = 5) were compared using multiple diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices. A visible isotropic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) pattern was observed in the lesion due to radiation necrosis, which consisted of a hypointense central zone and a hyperintense peripheral zone. There were significantly lower ADC, parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity in the necrotic central zone than in the peripheral zone (all P < 0.001). When radiation-induced necrosis was compared with viable tumor, radiation necrosis had significantly lower ADC than 9L gliosarcoma and human glioma xenografts (both P < 0.01) in the central zone, and significantly lower fractional anisotropy than 9L gliosarcoma (P = 0.005) and human glioma xenografts (P = 0.012) in the peripheral zone. Histological analysis revealed parenchymal coagulative necrosis in the central zone, and damaged vessels and reactive astrogliosis in the peripheral zone. These data suggest that qualitative and quantitative analysis of the DTI maps can provide useful information by which to distinguish between radiation necrosis and viable glioma.

N2  -  Background: To describe clinical presentations of intracranial sinusitis complications in childhood, their pitfalls and imaging findings.Materiel and methods: This retrospective IRB-approved single-center study included infants diagnosed with sinusitis and empyema and/or other intracranial complications who underwent imaging between September 2008 and September 2019. Three radiologists individually reviewed clinical charts and imaging findings, including sinusitis complications and at-risk anatomical variations.Results: 21 children (76% males and 24% females, mean age 13 +/- 3.1 years) with imaging pansinusitis were included. Headache (95%) and fever (90%) were the main clinical nonspecific signs. Ten (48%) children pre-sented an extradural empyema, nine (43%) children had a subdural empyema and two (10%) children had both. Frontal location sinusitis was the most common (76%). In MRI, all empyema presented as a hypo intensity on pre-contrast T1-WI, a hyperintensity on T2-WI, a reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and a peripheral contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1-WI. CT or MRI revealed intracranial complications such as a collection size increase (52%), a midline shift (62%), intraparenchymal abscesses (24%), a cerebral venous thrombosis (29%), an intracranial pressure increase (29%), cerebral ischemia (43%) and Pott's Puffy Tumor (10%). Imaging highlighted sinus anatomical abnormalities in 52% of cases. All children were treated with sinus drainage and/or neurosurgery. Long-term follow-up was favorable in 14 cases (67%).Conclusion: Complications of sinusitis are life threatening in the studied population. Empyema and cerebral complications may be misleading. Brain contrast-enhanced CT covering sinuses and orbits, is mainly the first examination done but MRI is mandatory.

N2  -  Choriocarcinoma in a viable pregnancy is uncommon. The diagnosis can easily be missed when there is an explanation for the clinical symptoms that the cancer can mimic. We present the case of a primigravid patient whose choriocarcinoma was initially missed as a result of seemingly obvious explanations for her atypical history and disease manifestation. The patient is a Caucasian female at 30 weeks and 5 days of gestation who presented with persistent headaches and new-onset tonic-clonic seizures found on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have a left intracranial hematoma, a 5 mm midline shift, and multiple foci of restricted diffusion. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The fetus was emergently delivered 1 week into hospitalization for non-reassuring fetal heart tracings in the setting of maternal lethargy secondary to continued AVM hemorrhage. The patient's hospital course was complicated by four episodes of intracranial bleeding and edema requiring neurosurgical intervention. Three weeks after hospitalization she was discharged to a rehabilitation center, shortly after which placental biopsy demonstrated choriocarcinoma. MRI after readmission demonstrated extensive metastatic disease and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were greater than 225,000 mIU/mL. Despite two additional neurosurgical procedures and extensive chemotherapy the patient died 3 months after initial presentation. Choriocarcinoma is extremely rare in viable pregnancies, but it should be considered when a parturient presents with intracranial bleeding. A high level of suspicion and serial serum hCG levels may lead to early and potentially life-saving multidrug chemotherapy. With a broader differential, earlier hCG measurement, and earlier treatment, our patient may have survived.

N2  -  Advances in diagnostic imaging modalities and improved access to specialty care have led directly to an increased diagnosis of both metastatic and primary brain tumors. As technology has improved, so has the ability to treat this larger patient population. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently shown the potential to aid in histologic diagnosis as well as to identify local brain invasion outside of that readily identifiable by conventional MRI. Similar to DTI, functional MRI provides a noninvasive means of delineating tumor margin from eloquent cortex and aids in preoperative surgical planning. As the literature shows increasing support for the advantages of extensive resection in glioma patients, modalities that aid in this regard are displaying increased importance. Surgeons have recently demonstrated the utility of intraoperative MRI in increasing extent of resection in both low- and high-grade glioma patients. Intraoperative tumor fluorescence provided by the chemical compound 5-aminolevulinic acid assists surgeons in identifying the true tumor margin during resection of glial neoplasms consequently increasing extent of resection. Finally, laser interstitial thermal therapy is an emerging treatment modality allowing surgeons to treat small intracranial lesions with potentially decreased morbidity via this minimally invasive approach. The following review analyzes the recent literature in an effort to describe how these modalities can and should be used in the treatment of patients with intracranial pathology.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of constructing a nomogram model based on apparent diffusion coefficient values within 1 cm of the residual tumor cavity to predict the postoperative progression of gliomas. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with glioma who -nderwent surgery were retrospectively retrieved from the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC) was measured using a picture archiving and communication system. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was constructed with the optimal mADC threshold determined by the X-tile. A nomogram was developed based on the independent risk factors deter-mined using the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox regression model) to predict the progression of post-operative glioma. A receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model, and decision curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical value of the nomogram.RESULTS: There was good agreement between the mADC values of the 2 repeated measurements before and after, with a consistency correlation coefficient of 0.83. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that peritu-moral mADC values, degree of peritumoral enhancement, age, pathological grading, and degree of tumor resection were independent risk factors for predicting postoperative progression of glioma (all P< 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curves of the nomogram predicting 1, 2, and 3 years postoperative progression were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.91, respectively. The calibration curve showed good consis-tency between the observed and predicted values in the model. The curve showed that the nomogram model has a good clinical application value. CONCLUSIONS: The peritumoral mADC values, degree of peritumoral enhancement, age, pathological grade, and degree of tumor resection were independent factors affecting the postoperative progression of glioma. The nomogram model established for the first time based on mADC values within 1 cm of the tumor can predict the postoperative condition of patients with glioma intuitively and comprehensively. It can provide a relatively accurate prediction tool for neurosurgeons to individualize the evaluation of survival and prognosis, and formulate treat-ment plans for patients.

N2  -  A 74-year-old man with a history of asymptomatic right internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion experienced amaurosis fugax in the left eye. Angiography showed left cervical ICA stenosis in addition to right cervical ICA occlusion. The right anterior and middle cerebral artery (MCA) territories were perfused from the left ICA via the anterior communicating artery. Brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow and reduced cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide only in the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient underwent left carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Transcranial Doppler monitoring showed microembolic signals in the left MCA during dissection of the left ICA, but intraoperative monitoring suggested absence of global hypoperfusion or ischemia in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres during left ICA clamping. Transient and slight motor weakness of the left upper extremity was noted on recovery from anesthesia. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the development of new spotty ischemic lesions only in the right cerebral hemisphere. The present case suggests that intraoperative cerebral embolism causing postoperative neurological deficits can develop exclusively in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to CEA if the hemisphere has preoperative hemodynamic impairment and collateral circulation via the anterior communicating artery from the ICA ipsilateral to CEA.

N2  -  PurposeTo evaluate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in differentiating hepatic abscess from malignant mimickers with an emphasis on periphery of the lesions.
Materials and MethodsThirty-nine patients with hepatic abscess and 74 patients with malignant hepatic tumors were included, who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. For qualitative and quantitative analysis, signal intensities and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the periphery were assessed. Two observers reviewed DWI and ADC maps rated using a 5-point scale. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.; ResultsThe periphery of hepatic abscesses was T1-hypointense, arterial hyperintense, and hypointense on hepatobiliary phase less frequently than that of malignant tumors (P < 0.05). No hepatic abscesses showed peripheral washout on 3-min late phase compared with malignant tumors (59.5%) (P < 0.001). Both groups showed hyperintense rims on DWI, but, 37(94.9%) abscesses revealed rims with high ADC values compared with one (1.4%) malignant tumor (P < 0.001). Mean ADC values of abscesses (1.47 x 10(-3) mm(2)s 0.36 standard deviation) were significantly higher than those of malignancies (0.68 x 10(-3) mm(2)s +- 0.20). Diagnostic performance (area under the ROC curve Az) of DWI in identifying hepatic abscess was 0.986 and 0.982 for each observer.; ConclusionIn addition to conventional MRI, DWI is helpful in differentiating hepatic abscess from malignant mimickers.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is useful in diagnosing bacterial brain abscesses, but DWI features of fungal brain abscesses have not been characterized. Because fungal abscesses are not purulent, we hypothesized that their DWI characteristics are distinct from those of bacterial abscesses.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical, neuropathologic and neuroimaging findings of patients with fungal brain infections due to Aspergillus (n = 6), Rhizopus (n = 1), or Scedosporium (n = 1) species. DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained before definitive diagnosis and antifungal therapy. ADC ratios (lesioncontralateral white matter) were calculated.; RESULTS: Two patients had a rapidly progressive, fatal course, with cerebritis and acute inflammation; fungal organisms were largely restricted to vessels. Lesions were predominantly nonenhancing and had heterogeneous foci of restricted diffusion. Six patients with subacute neurologic presentations had acute or chronic inflammation, capsule formation, focal necrosis, and fungal organisms disseminated throughout the lesion. Their abscesses were ring enhancing. In five, lesions had restricted diffusion in the central nonenhancing portions. The sixth patient had a lesion with a peripheral rim of restricted diffusion but elevated central diffusion; histopathology showed early abscess formation. Mean ADC for all lesions was 0.33 +- 0.06 X 10(-3) mm(2)s, with an average ADC ratio of 0.43.; CONCLUSION: Fungal cerebral abscesses may have central restricted diffusion similar to that of bacterial abscesses but with histologic features of acute or chronic inflammation and necrosis rather than suppuration. Altered water diffusion in these lesions likely reflects highly proteinaceous fluid and cellular infiltration.

N2  -  In multiple sclerosis (MS), accurate in vivo characterization of the heterogeneous lesional and extra-lesional tissue pathology remains challenging. Marshalling several advanced imaging techniques - quantitative relaxation time (T1) mapping, a model-free average diffusion signal approach and four multi-shell diffusion models - this study investigates the performance of multi-shell diffusion models and characterizes the microstructural damage within (i) different MS lesion types - active, chronic active, and chronic inactive - (ii) their respective periplaque white matter (WM), and (iii) the surrounding normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). In 83 MS participants (56 relapsing-remitting, 27 progressive) and 23 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC), we analysed a total of 317 paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL+), 232 non-paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL-), 38 contrastenhancing lesions (CEL). Consistent with previous findings and histology, our analysis revealed the ability of advanced multi-shell diffusion models to characterize the unique microstructural patterns of CEL, and to elucidate their possible evolution into a resolving (chronic inactive) vs smoldering (chronic active) inflammatory stage. In addition, we showed that the microstructural damage extends well beyond the MRI-visible lesion edge, gradually fading out while moving outward from the lesion edge into the immediate WM periplaque and the NAWM, the latter still characterized by diffuse microstructural damage in MS vs HC. This study also emphasizes the critical role of selecting appropriate diffusion models to elucidate the complex pathological architecture of MS lesions and their periplaque. More specifically, multi-compartment diffusion models based on biophysically interpretable metrics such as neurite orientation dispersion and density (NODDI; mean auc=0.8002) emerge as the preferred choice for MS applications, while simpler models based on a representation of the diffusion signal, like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; mean auc=0.6942), consistently underperformed, also when compared to T1 mapping (mean auc=0.73375).

N2  -  Purpose: Dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging requires high temporal sampling, which poses limits on achievable spatial coverage and resolution. Additionally, more encoding-intensive multi-echo acquisitions for quantitative imaging are desired to mitigate contrast leakage effects, which further limits spatial encoding. We present an accelerated sequence that provides whole-brain coverage at an improved spatiotemporal resolution, to allow for dynamic quantitative R-2 and R*(2) mapping during contrast-enhanced imaging.
Methods: A multi-echo spin and gradient-echo sequence was implemented with simultaneous multislice acquisition. Complementary k-space sampling between repetitions and joint virtual coil reconstruction were used along with a dynamic phase-matching technique to achieve high-quality reconstruction at 9-fold acceleration, which enabled 2 x 2 x 5 mm whole-brain imaging at TR of 1.5 to 1.7 seconds. The multi-echo images from this sequence were fit to achieve quantitative R-2 and R*(2) maps for each repetition, and subsequently used to find perfusion measures including cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume.; Results: Images reconstructed using joint virtual coil show improved image quality and g-factor compared with conventional reconstruction methods, resulting in improved quantitative maps with a 9-fold acceleration factor and whole-brain coverage during the dynamic perfusion acquisition.; Conclusion: The method presented shows the advantage of using a joint virtual coil-GRAPPA reconstruction to allow for high acceleration factors while maintaining reliable image quality for quantitative perfusion mapping, with the potential to improve tumor diagnostics and monitoring.

N2  -  Introduction Distinguishing between vasogenic edema and reactive astrogliosis may be difficult in some instances. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be used to differentiate these two types of changes.
Methods The study population included 11 patients with perilesional vasogenic edema and 11 patients with gliosis examined with conventional MR imaging and DW imaging. The signal intensities of conventional pulse sequences and ADC values were calculated in regions of interest placed in the hyperintense edematous or gliotic regions and compared with those of normal-appearing white matter. Signal intensity ratios and ADC values in gliosis were compared with those in vasogenic edema using the Mann-Whitney U-test.; Results While considerable overlap was present for signal intensity ratios on conventional MR images, areas of gliosis demonstrated significantly higher ADC values (1.76+-0.09x10(-3) mm2s) than areas of vasogenic edema (1.35+-0.06x10-3 mm(2)s; P < 0.0001) without overlap.; Conclusion ADC values are helpful in differentiating reactive gliosis from vasogenic edema.

The lesions consisted of spongy degeneration leading to a cavity formation with insufficient glia fiber proliferation. We noted the characteristic findings of Alzheimer glia (Types I  and II) and Opalski cells and the new formation in capillaries. Te distribution of the changes in the hemispheres showed the typical pattern with a tendency of preferential superior and anterior localization and a relative preservation of the hippocampal formation, carcarine areas, amygdaloid nuclei and the hypothalamus. Similar cases in the literature were reviewed.

N2  -  Background: Several studies have reported lower focal demyelination and inflammatory activity in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) than in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). However, very little is known about possible differences in damage and distribution that may occur within lesions visible on magnetic resonance imaging in the 2 forms of the disease.
Objective: To evaluate differences in spatial distribution and structural damage of focal demyelinating lesions in patients with PPMS and RRMS.; Design: We acquired conventional magnetic resonance and magnetization transfer images in 24 PPMS and 36 RRMS patients (matched for sex, age, and disease duration) and 23 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. In each participant, we measured T2- and T1-weighted lesion volumes and magnetization transfer ratios in lesional and nonlesional brain tissues. The spatial distribution of focal demyelination was assessed using T2- and T1-weighted lesion probability maps in each patient group. Voxel-based procedures were performed.; Setting: University hospital.; Results: Patients with PPMS had greater disability than those with RRMS, with 70% of PPMS patients and 11% of RRMS patients having relevant motor symptoms. The T1- and T2-weighted lesion volumes were higher in PPMS than in RRMS patients (P < .001). T1- and T2-weighted lesion probability maps showed that the maximum probability for lesions was higher in PPMS (peak probability, 45% and 29%, respectively) than in RRMS (peak probability, 33% and 19%, respectively) patients and was localized in the corona radiata. Voxel-wise analysis of lesional magnetization transfer ratios gave overlapping results.; Conclusions: Differences in cerebral pathologic involvement exist between RRMS and PPMS and contribute to variations in clinical disability.

N2  -  T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been widely used for pretreatment work-up for prostate cancer, but its accuracy for the detection and localization of prostate cancer is unsatisfactory. To improve the utility of MR imaging for diagnostic evaluation, various other techniques may be used. Dynamic contrast material - enhanced MR imaging allows an assessment of parameters that are useful for differentiating cancer from normal tissue. The advantages of this technique include the direct depiction of tumor vascularity and, possibly, obviation of an endorectal coil; however, there also are disadvantages, such as limited visibility of cancer in the transitional zone. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates the restriction of diffusion and the reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient values in cancerous tissue. This technique allows short acquisition time and provides high contrast resolution between cancer and normal tissue, but individual variability in apparent diffusion coefficient values may erode diagnostic performance. The accuracy of MR spectroscopy, which depicts a higher ratio of choline and creatine to citrate in cancerous tissue than in normal tissue, is generally accepted. The technique also allows detection of prostate cancer in the transitional zone. However, it requires a long acquisition time, does not directly depict the periprostatic area, and frequently is affected by artifacts. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation in which both functional and anatomic MR imaging techniques are used with an understanding of their particular advantages and disadvantages may help improve the accuracy of MR for detection and localization of prostate cancer.

N2  -  In the present study, we describe a fingerprinting approach to analyze the time evolution of the MR signal and retrieve quantitative information about the microvascular network. We used a Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo (GESFIDE) sequence and defined a fingerprint as the ratio of signals acquired pre- and post-injection of an iron-based contrast agent. We then simulated the same experiment with an advanced numerical tool that takes a virtual voxel containing blood vessels as input, then computes microscopic magnetic fields and water diffusion effects, and eventually derives the expected MR signal evolution. The parameter inputs of the simulations (cerebral blood volume [CBV], mean vessel radius [R], and blood oxygen saturation [SO2]) were varied to obtain a dictionary of all possible signal evolutions. The best fit between the observed fingerprint and the dictionary was then determined by using least square minimization. This approach was evaluated in 5 normal subjects and the results were compared to those obtained by using more conventional MR methods, steady-state contrast imaging for CBV and R and a global measure of oxygenation obtained from the superior sagittal sinus for SO2. The fingerprinting method enabled the creation of high-resolution parametric maps of the microvascular network showing expected contrast and fine details. Numerical values in gray matter (CBV = 3.1 +/- 0.7%, R = 12.6 +/- 2.4 pm, SO2 = 59.5 +/- 4.7%) are consistent with literature reports and correlated with conventional MR approaches. SO2 values in white matter (53.0 +/- 4.0%) were slightly lower than expected. Numerous improvements can easily be made and the method should be useful to study brain pathologies.

N2  -  Recent technological progress in the multiband echo planer imaging (MB EPI) technique enables accelerated MR diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and allows whole brain, multi-b-value diffusion imaging to be acquired within a clinically feasible time. However, its applications at 7 T have been limited due to B1 field inhomogeneity and increased susceptibility artifact. It is an ongoing debate whether DWI at 7 T can be performed properly in patients, and a systematic SNR comparison for multiband spin-echo EPI between 3 T and 7 T has not been methodically studied. The goal of this study was to use MB EPI at 7 T in order to obtain 90-directional multi-shell DWI within a clinically feasible acquisition time for patients with glioma. This study included an SNR comparison between 3 T and 7 T, and the application of B1 mapping and distortion correction procedures for reducing the impact of variations in B0 and B1. The optimized multiband sequence was applied in 20 patients with glioma to generate both DTI and NODDI maps for comparison of values in tumor and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Our SNR analysis showed that MB EPI at 7 T was comparable to that at 3 T, and the data quality acquired in patients was clinically acceptable. NODDI maps provided unique contrast within the T2 lesion that was not seen in anatomical images or DTI maps. Such contrast may reflect the complexity of tissue compositions associated with disease progression and treatment effects. The ability to consistently obtain high quality diffusion data at 7 T will contribute towards the implementation of a comprehensive brain MRI examination at ultra-high field.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to determine the ability of multiparametric MRI to identify the early effects of individual treatment, during combined chemo-radiotherapy on brain tumours. Eighty male rats bearing 9L gliosarcomas were randomized into four groups: untreated, anti-angiogenic therapy (SORA group), microbeam radiation therapy (MRT group) and both treatments (MRT+SORA group). Multiparametric MRI (tumour volume, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (ADC), blood volume fraction (BVf), microvessel index (VSI), vessel wall integrity (AUC(P846)) and tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2))) was performed 1 day before and 2, 5 and 8 days after treatment initiation. Unpaired t-tests and one-way ANOVA were used for statistical analyses. Each MR parameter measured in our protocol was revealed to be sensitive to tumour changes induced by any of the therapies used (individually or combined). When compared with untreated tumours, SORA induced a decrease in BVf, VSI, StO(2) and AUC(P846), MRT generated an increase in ADC and AUC(P846) and combined therapies yielded mixed effects: an increase in ADC and AUC(P846) and a decrease in BVf, StO(2) and AUC(P846). MRT and MRT+SORA significantly slowed tumour growth. Despite these two groups presenting with similar tumour sizes, the information yielded from MR multiparameter assessment indicated that, when used concomitantly, each therapy induced distinguishable and appreciable physiological changes in the tumour. Our results suggest that multiparametric MRI can monitor the effects of individual treatments, used concomitantly, on brain tumours. Such monitoring would be useful for the detection of tumour resistance to drug/radiotherapy in patients undergoing concomitant therapies. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  Background Moyamoya disease (MMD) and non-MMD have different pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment policy. Purpose To identify differences in hemodynamics between MMD and non-MMD using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Material and Methods Patients who had undergone Tc-99m-ECD or I-123-IMP SPECT, and IVIM imaging were retrospectively studied. IVIM imaging was acquired using six different b-values. Cerebral blood flow ratio (CBFR) in the basal ganglia was calculated using a standardized volume-of-interest template. The cerebellum was used as a reference region. IVIM perfusion fraction (f) was obtained using a two-step fitting algorithm. Elliptical regions of interest were placed in bilateral basal ganglia on the IVIM f map. Patients were classified into MMD and non-MMD groups. The correlation between CBFR and mean IVIM f (f(mean)) in the basal ganglia was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results In total, 20 patients with MMD and 28 non-MMD patients were analyzed. No significant differences in f(mean) were observed among MMD, affected hemisphere with non-MMD (non-MMDaff), and unaffected hemispheres with non-MMD (non-MMDunaff). A negative correlation was seen between f(mean) and CBFR in the MMD group (r = -0.40, P = 0.0108), but not in the non-MMD group (non-MMDaff, r = 0.07, P = 0.69; non-MMDunaff, r = -0.22, P = 0.29). No significant differences were found among MMD and non-MMD patients, irrespective of SPECT tracers. Conclusion The combination of IVIM MRI and SPECT appears to allow non-invasive identification of differences in hemodynamics between MMD and non-MMD.

T2  -  BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION

N2  -  In vivo tracking of white matter fibres catalysed a modern perspective on the pivotal role of brain connectome disruption in neuropsychological deficits. However, the examination of white matter integrity in neurological patients by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging bears conceptual limitations and is not widely applicable, as it requires imaging-compatible patients and resources beyond the capabilities of many researchers. The indirect estimation of structural disconnection offers an elegant and economical alternative. For this approach, a patient's structural lesion information and normative connectome data are combined to estimate different measures of lesion-induced structural disconnection. Using one of several toolboxes, this method is relatively easy to implement and is even available to scientists without expertise in fibre tracking analyses. Nevertheless, the anatomo-behavioural statistical mapping of structural brain disconnection requires analysis steps that are not covered by these toolboxes. In this paper, we first review the current state of indirect lesion disconnection estimation, the different existing measures, and the available software. Second, we aim to fill the remaining methodological gap in statistical disconnection-symptom mapping by providing an overview and guide to disconnection data and the statistical mapping of their relationship to behavioural measurements using either univariate or multivariate statistical modelling. To assist in the practical implementation of statistical analyses, we have included software tutorials and analysis scripts.

T2  -  INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY

N2  -  The last 5 years of technological advances with major impact on clinical magnetic resonance (MR) are discussed, with greater emphasis on those that are most recent. These developments have already had a critical positive effect on clinical diagnosis and therapy and presage continued rapid improvements for the next 5 years. This review begins with a discussion of 2 topics that encompass the breadth of MR, in terms of anatomic applications, contrast media, and MR angiography. Subsequently, innovations are discussed by anatomic category, picking the areas with the greatest development, starting with the brain, moving forward to the liver and kidney, and concluding with the musculoskeletal system, breast, and prostate. Two final topics are then considered, which will likely, with time, become independent major fields in their own right, interventional MR and MR positron emission tomography (PET).
The next decade will bring a new generation of MR contrast media, with research focused on substantial improvements (9100-fold) in relaxivity (contrast effect), thus providing greater efficacy, safety, and tissue targeting. Magnetic resonance angiography will see major advances because of the use of compressed sensing, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, with movement away from nondynamic imaging. The breadth of available techniques and tissue contrast has greatly expanded in brain imaging, benefiting both from the introduction of new basic categories of imaging techniques, such as readout-segmented echo planar imaging and 3D fast spin echo imaging with variable flip angles, and from new refinements specific to anatomic areas, such as double inversion recovery and MP2RAGE. Liver imaging has benefited from the development of techniques to easily and rapidly assess lipid, and will see, overall, a marked improvement in the next 5 years from new techniques on the verge of clinical introduction, such as controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration (CAIPIRINHA), with a substantial impact on both spatial resolution and scan time. Renal MR is benefiting from the application of blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging, providing an assessment of renal function critical for the evaluation of chronic kidney disease. Techniques to reduce metal artifact are a major focus of development in musculoskeletal MR and are critical for the ever-increasing postsurgical and implant patient population, leading to markedly improved imaging of tissue adjacent to metal and diagnosis of infection, prosthesis loosening, and postsurgical complications such as fracture. In breast MR, scan techniques are continuing to evolve, and the impact of this examination on screening for and evaluation and treatment of breast carcinoma is substantial with continued expansion of indications. Prostate MR has benefited from multiparametric imaging and the application of diffusion-weighted imaging, the latter technique also now applied more generally in body imaging, with a substantial clinical impact, in particular for the detection of tumor lymph nodes. Interventional MR is still early in its development, although well established in many centers, possessing great potential in comparison with computed tomography (CT) because of superior soft-tissue contrast, real-time multiplanar imaging guidance and monitoring, the availability of temperature mapping, and the lack of ionizing radiation. And last but not least, MR-PET is in its infancy, with the first round of clinical units installed in the past 2 years and early clinical experience showing equivalence and, in some instances, superiority to PET-CT. As with the field of MR itself, which began when CT was already an established modality, MR-PET will likely, in the next decade, become an equivalent modality to PET-CT, if not begin to supplant the latter modality.

N2  -  This study aimed to demonstrate a reliable automatic segmentation method for independently separating reduced diffusion and decreased perfusion areas in ischemic stroke brains using constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (cNMF) pattern recognition in directional intravoxel incoherent motion MRI (IVIM-MRI). First, the feasibility of cNMF-based segmentation of IVIM signals was investigated in both simulations and in vivo experiments. The cNMF analysis was independently performed for S-0-normalized and scaled (by the difference between the maximum and minimum) IVIM signals, respectively. Segmentations of reduced diffusion (from S-0-normalized IVIM signals) and decreased perfusion (from scaled IVIM signals) areas were performed using the corresponding cNMF pattern weight maps. Second, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for directional IVIM signals to investigate the relationship between the degree of vessel alignment and the direction of the diffusion gradient. Third, directional IVIM-MRI experiments (x, y and z diffusion-gradient directions, 20 b values at 7 T) were performed for normal (n = 4), sacrificed (n = 1, no flow) and ischemic stroke models (n = 4, locally reduced flow). The results showed that automatic segmentation of the hypoperfused lesion using cNMF analysis was more accurate than segmentation using the conventional double-exponential fitting. Consistent with the simulation, the double-exponential pattern of the IVIM signals was particularly strong in white matter and ventricle regions when the directional flows were aligned with the applied diffusion-gradient directions. cNMF analysis of directional IVIM signals allowed robust automated segmentation of white matter, ventricle, vascular and hypoperfused regions in the ischemic brain. In conclusion, directional IVIM signals were simultaneously sensitive to diffusion and aligned flow and were particularly useful for automatically segmenting ischemic lesions via cNMF-based pattern recognition.

N2  -  We propose a framework for the robust and fully-automatic segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images called "Multi-Atlas-Label Propagation with Expectation-Maximisation based refinement" (MALP-EM). The presented approach is based on a robust registration approach (MAPER), highly performant label fusion (joint label fusion) and intensity-based label refinement using EM. We further adapt this framework to be applicable for the segmentation of brain images with gross changes in anatomy. We propose to account for consistent registration errors by relaxing anatomical priors obtained by multi-atlas propagation and a weighting scheme to locally combine anatomical atlas priors and intensity-refined posterior probabilities. The method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset used in a recent MICCAI segmentation challenge. In this context we show that MALP-EM is competitive for the segmentation of MR brain scans of healthy adults when compared to state-of-the-art automatic labelling techniques. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach, we employed MALP-EM to segment 125 MR brain images into 134 regions from subjects who had sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI). We employ a protocol to assess segmentation quality if no manual reference labels are available. Based on this protocol, three independent, blinded raters confirmed on 13 MR brain scans with pathology that MALP-EM is superior to established label fusion techniques. We visually confirm the robustness of our segmentation approach on the full cohort and investigate the potential of derived symmetry-based imaging biomarkers that correlate with and predict clinically relevant variables in TBI such as the Marshall Classification (MC) or Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). Specifically, we show that we are able to stratify TBI patients with favourable outcomes from non-favourable outcomes with 64.7% accuracy using acute-phase MR images and 66.8% accuracy using follow-up MR images. Furthermore, we are able to differentiate subjects with the presence of a mass lesion or midline shift from those with diffuse brain injury with 76.0% accuracy. The thalamus, putamen, pallidum and hippocampus are particularly affected. Their involvement predicts TBI disease progression. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Objective: Focused ultrasound thalamotomy is an emerging treatment for essential tremor, and it is ideal for studying reorganization in the human brain after acute injury because it creates a controlled thalamic ablation without breaching the cortex. However, there is not yet a metric capable of detecting microstructural changes in the presence of acute phase edema with good sensitivity in the chronic phase, when the lesion boundaries become inconspicuous.
Methods: We prospectively studied microstructural changes at the lesion site using generalized q-sampling imaging with restricted diffusion imaging. We obtained diffusion-weighted MRI scans preoperatively, 1 day after (n = 18), and 1 year after (n = 9) focused ultrasound thalamotomy. The restricted diffusion imaging maps were compared at the group level, controlling for improvement in contralateral hand tremor.; Results: The restricted diffusion imaging metric significantly increased in the 1 day post images, and the area with restricted diffusivity extended beyond the lesion boundaries identified on T2-weighted imaging. Two distinct zones of microstructural changes were identified, and the lesion area was identifiable at 1 year. The anterior and medial aspects of the lesion had a significant changes in RDI at 1 year, potentially signifying reorganization. The voxels with significant changes in restricted diffusion imaging values extend beyond the VIM into the surrounding white matter.; Interpretation: Correcting for free water contamination with restricted diffusion imaging allowed us to study microstructural changes after focused ultrasound thalamotomy. We observed statistically significant changes in RDI in the anterior and medial aspect of the lesion at 1 year. Whether these changes represent tissue reorganization remains to be confirmed in future studies. These findings may support performing additional ablations antero-medially for durable efficacy.

N2  -  Aims: describe a new profilometry framework for the multimetric analysis of white matter tracts, and demonstrate its application to multiple sclerosis (MS) with radial diffusivity (RD) and myelin water fraction (MWF). Methods: A cohort of 15 normal controls (NC) and 141 MS patients were imaged with T1, T2 FLAIR, T2 relaxometry and diffusion MRI (dMRI) sequences. T1 and T2 FLAIR allowed for the identification of patients having lesion(s) on the tracts studied, with a special focus on the forceps minor. T2 relaxometry provided MWF maps, while dMRI data yielded RD maps and the tractography required to compute MWF and RD tract profiles. The statistical framework combined a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) both accounting for age and gender, with multiple comparison corrections. Results: In the single-case case study the profilometry visualization showed a clear departure of MWF and RD from the NC normative data at the lesion location(s). Group comparison from MANCOVA demonstrated significant differences at lesion locations, and a significant age effect in several tracts. The follow-up LDA analysis suggested MWF better discriminates groups than RD. Discussion and conclusion: While progress has been made in both tract-profiling and metrics for white matter characterization, no single framework for a joint analysis of multimodality tract profiles accounting for age and gender is known to exist. The profilometry analysis and visualization appears to be a promising method to compare groups using a single score from MANCOVA while assessing the contribution of each metric with LDA.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been proposed as a sensitive measure of disease severity capable of detecting subtle changes in gray matter and white matter brain compartments in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, DWI has been applied to the study of MS clinical subtypes in only a few studies. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the validity of a novel, fully automated method for the calculation of quantitative DWI measures. We also wanted to assess the correlation between whole brain (WB)-DWI variables and clinical and MRI measures of disease severity in a large cohort of MS patients. For this purpose we studied 432 consecutive MS patients (mean age 44.4 +/- 10.2 years), 16 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 38 normal controls (NC) using 1.5 T brain MRI. Clinical disease subtypes were as follows: 294 relapsing-remitting (RR), 123 secondary-progressive (SP) and 15 primary-progressive (PP). Mean disease duration was 12 +/- 10 years. Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 3.3 +/- 2.1. Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), gray matter fraction (GMF) and white matter fraction (WMF) were calculated using a fully automated method. Mean parenchymal diffusivity (MPD) maps were created. DWI indices of peak position (PP), peak height (PH), MPD and entropy (ENT) were obtained. T2-and T1-lesion volumes (LV), EDSS, ambulation index (AI) and nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) were also assessed. MS patients had significantly lower BPF (d=1.26; p < 0.001) and GMF (d=0.61; p=0.003), and higher ENT (d=1.2; p < 0.0001), MPD (d=1.04; p < 0.0001) and PH (d=0.47; p=0.045) than NC subjects. A GEM analysis, adjusted for age and multiple comparisons, revealed significant differences between different clinical subtypes for BPF, GMF, ENT, PH, PP, T2-LV and T1-LV (p < 0.0001), WMF (p=0.001) and MPD (p=0.023). In RR and SP MS patients, ENT showed a more robust correlation with other MRI (r=0.54 to 0.67, p < 0.0001) and clinical (r=0.31 to 0.36, p < 0.0001) variables than MPD (r=0.23 to 0.41, p < 0.001 for MRI and r=0.13 to 0.18; p=0.006 to p < 0.001 for clinical variables). The GMF and BPF showed a slightly stronger relationship with all clinical variables (r=0.33 to 0.48; p < 0.0001), when compared to both lesion and DWI measures. ENT (R-2=0.28;p < 0.0001) and GMF (R-2=0.26; p < 0.001) were best related with SP disease course. This study highlights the validity of DWI in discerning differences between NC and MS patients, as well as between different MS subtypes. ENT is a sensitive marker of overall brain damage that is strongly related to clinical impairment in patients with SP MS. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The purpose of our study was to explore the difference between isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1/2 gene mutation-positive and -negative high-grade gliomas (HGGs) using histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) maps. We enrolled 52 patients with histopathologically confirmed HGGs with IDH1/2(P) (n = 16) or IDH1/2(N) (n = 36). Histogram parameters of ADC and nCBV maps were correlated with gene mutations by using the unpaired student's t test and multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis. The mean ADC value was higher in the IDH1(P) group than IDH1(N) (1,282.8 vs. 1,159.6 mm(2)/s, P = .0113). In terms of the cumulative ADC histograms, the 10th and 50th percentile values were also higher in the IDH1(P) than IDH1(N) (P = .0104 and .0183, respectively). We observed a higher 90th percentile value (3.121 vs. 2.397, P = .0208) and a steeper slope between the 10th (C10) and 90th (C90) of cumulative nCBV histograms (0.03386 vs. 0.02425/%, P = .0067) in the IDH1(N) group. Multivariate analysis showed that the mean ADC mean value (P = .0048), the C90 value (P = .0113), and the slope between C10 and C90 (P = .0049) were the significant variables in the differentiation of IDH1(P) from IDH1(N). In conclusion, histogram analysis of ADC and nCBV maps based on entire tumor volume can be a useful tool for distinguishing IDH1(P) and IDH1(N), and it predicts that IDHP tumors have a more heterogeneous microenvironment than IDHN ones.

N2  -  Objective: Hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) without diffusion abnormalities is occasionally found in patients with an acute stroke. This study was to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of HARM without diffusion abnormalities.
Materials and Methods: There was a retrospective review of magnetic resonance images 578 patients with acute strokes and identified those who did not have acute infarction Lesions, as mapped by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). These patients were classified into an imaging-negative stroke and HARM without diffusion abnormalities groups, based on the DWI findings and postcontrast fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at admission, 1 day, and 7 days after the event, as well as clinical data and risk factors, were compared between the imaging-negative stroke and HARM without diffusion abnormalities groups.; Results: Seventy-seven acute stroke patients without any DWI abnormalities were found. There were 63 patients with an imaging-negative stroke (accounting for 10.9% of 578) and 13 patients with HARM without diffusion abnormalities (accounting for 2.4% of 578). The NIHSS scores at admission were higher in HARM without diffusion abnormalities group than in the imaging-negative stroke group (median, 4.5 vs. 1.0; p < 0.001), but the scores at 7 days after the event were not significantly different between the two groups (median, 0 vs. 0; p = 1). The patients with HARM without diffusion abnormalities were significantly older, compared with patients with an imaging-negative stroke (mean, 73.1 years vs. 55.9 years; p < 0.001).; Conclusion: Patients with HARM without diffusion abnormalities are older and have similarly favorable short-term neurological outcomes, compared with the patients with imaging-negative stroke.

N2  -  The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model allows to map diffusion (D) and perfusion-related parameters (F and D*). Parameter estimation is, however, error-prone due to the non-linearity of the signal model, the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the small volume fraction of perfusion in the in-vivo brain. In the present work, the performance of Bayesian inference was examined in the presence of brain pathologies characterized by hypo- and hyperperfusion. In particular, a hierarchical and a spatial prior were combined. Performance was compared relative to conventional segmented least squares regression, hierarchical prior only (non-segmented and segmented data likelihoods) and a deep learning approach. Realistic numerical brain IVIM simulations were conducted to assess errors relative to ground truth. In-vivo, data of 11 central nervous system cancer patients and 9 patients with acute stroke were acquired. The proposed method yielded reduced error in simulations for both the cancer and acute stroke scenarios compared to other methods across the whole investigated SNR range. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the proposed method was better or on par compared to the other techniques in-vivo. The proposed Bayesian approach hence improves IVIM parameter estimation in brain cancer and acute stroke. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Cell invasion, motility, and proliferation level estimate (CIMPLE) mapping is a new imaging technique that provides parametric maps of microscopic invasion and proliferation rate estimates using serial diffusion MRI data. However, a few practical constraints have limited the use of CIMPLE maps as a tool for estimating these dynamic parameters, particularly during short-interval follow-up times. The purpose of the current study was to develop an approximation for the CIMPLE map solution for short-interval scanning involving the assumption that net intervoxel tumor invasion does not occur within sufficiently short time frames. Proliferation rate maps created using the "no invasion" approximation were found to be increasingly similar to maps created from full solution during increasingly longer follow-up intervals (3D cross correlation, R (2) = 0.5298, P = 0.0001). Results also indicate proliferation rate maps from the "no invasion" approximation had significantly higher sensitivity (82 vs. 64 %) and specificity (90 vs. 80 %) for predicting 6 month progression free survival and was a better predictor of time to progression during standard radiochemotherapy compared to the full CIMPLE solution (log-rank; no invasion estimation, P = 0.0134; full solution, P = 0.0555). Together, results suggest the "no invasion" approximation allows for quick estimation of proliferation rate using diffusion MRI data obtained from multiple scans obtained daily or biweekly for use in quantifying early treatment response.

N2  -  Patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) have loss of central vision with severe damage of small-caliber fibers of the papillomacular bundle and optic nerve atrophy. The aim of this study was to define the presence and topographical distribution of brain grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) injury in LHON patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The correlation of such changes with neuro-ophthalmologic findings and measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) was also assessed. Dual-echo and fast-field echo scans were acquired from 12 LHON patients and 12 matched controls. VBM analysis was performed using SPM5 and an ANCOVA model. A complete neuro-ophthalmologic examination, including standardized automated Humphrey perimetry as well as average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness measurements were obtained in all the patients. Compared with controls, average peripapillary RNFL thickness was significantly decreased in LHON patients. LHON patients also had significant reduced GM volume in the bilateral primary visual cortex, and reduced WM volume in the optic chiasm, optic tract, and several areas located in the optic radiations (OR), bilaterally. Visual cortex and OR atrophy were significantly correlated with average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness (P < 0.001; r values ranging from 0.76 to 0.89). Brain damage in patients with LHON is not limited to the anterior visual pathways, but extends posteriorly to the OR and the primary visual cortex. Such a damage to the posterior parts of the visual pathways may be due either to trans-synaptic degeneration secondary to neuroaxonal damage in the retina and optic nerve or to local mitochondrial dysfunction.

N2  -  Urocortin 3 (Ucn 3) is a recently described peptide of the corticotropin-releasing factor family. Neurons expressing Ucn 3 mRNA and peptide are distributed in specific brain areas, including the median preoptic nucleus, the perifornical area (PFx), and the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MEA). Fibers immunoreactive to Ucn 3 are confined to certain brain nuclei, being particularly dense in the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV). In studies involving electrolytic lesions and analysis of Fos distribution according to behavioral paradigms, the PMV has been potentially implicated in conspecific aggression and sexual behavior. However, the role that Ucn 3 plays in this pathway has not been explored. Therefore, we investigated the origins of the urocortinergic innervation of the PMV of Wistar rat in an attempt to map the brain circuitry and identify likely related functions. We injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin b subunit into the PMV and found that 88% of the Ucn 3-immunoreactive fibers in the PMV originate in the dorsal MEA, and that few originate in the PFx. As a control, we injected the anterograde tracer biotin dextran amine into both regions. We observed that the PMV is densely innervated by the MEA, and scarcely innervated by the PFx. The MEA is a secondary relay of the vomeronasal system and projects amply to hypothalamic nuclei related to hormonal and behavioral adjustments, including the PMV. Although physiological studies should also be performed, we hypothesize that Ucn 3 participates in such pathways, conveying sensory information to the PMV, which in turn modulates behavioral and neuroendocrine responses.

N2  -  PurposePrediction of clinical outcomes in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is important for optimization of treatment planning. Quantitative imaging biomarkers for PCNSL have not yet been established. This study evaluated the prognostic value of pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging for progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with PCNSL.MethodsPretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging were retrospectively analyzed in 18 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL. Volumes of interest encompassing the tumors were assessed for measurements of blood plasma volume (Vp), volume transfer constant (K-trans), and apparent diffusion coefficient. Patients were divided into short and long PFS groups based on median PFS. Imaging and clinical variables were correlated with PFS.ResultsMedian PFS was 19.6 months. Lower Vp(mean) and K-mean(trans) values increased risk for rapid progression (<19.6 months). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an optimal Vp(mean) cutoff value of 2.29 (area under the curve [AUC]=0.74, sensitivity and specificity=0.78, p=0.023) for separating patients with short and long PFS. The optimal K-mean(trans) cutoff was 0.08 (AUC=0.74, sensitivity=0.67, specificity=0.78, p=0.025). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test demonstrated significantly (p=0.015) increased risk of rapid progression for patients with Vp(mean) < 2.29. Vp(mean) was significantly (p=0.03) associated with PFS on univariate Cox analysis. Apparent diffusion coefficient values and clinical factors did not influence PFS.ConclusionsPretreatment Vp and K-trans derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI may be novel prognostic quantitative imaging biomarkers of progression-free survival in patients with PCNSL. These data should be prospectively validated in larger patient cohorts.

N2  -  Our objective was to determine the contribution of diffusion MR imaging to standard MR imaging in the neuroradiological evaluation of children less than 2 years of age. Echo-planar diffusion MR imaging was added to standard MR exams in 75 consecutive patients under the age of 2 years. Single-shot echo-planar spin-echo T2 weighted images (EPSE-T2) were acquired. Isotropic diffusion-weighted images (DWT), attenuation coefficient maps (ACM), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were caIculated offline from images obtained with diffusion gradients (b = 1000 s/mm') in three orthogonal directions. Two neuroradiologists determined if EPSE-T2, DWI, or ACM contributed new information to spin-echo proton density (SE PD) and T2 studies, In 15 of IS abnormalities detected in 8 patients with symptoms less than 1 week in duration, DWI and/or ACM added information to SE PD and T2. Diffusion sequences detected five new lesions, showed six lesions with greater conspicuity, and identified four lesions with different diffusion character. In patients with symptoms of more than 7 days duration, diffusion studies added no information. Isotropic diffusion MR contributed to lesion detection and characterization in infants when symptoms were less than 1 week in duration. Diffusion MR is useful in patients with leukodystrophies, metabolic disorders, and patients with acute ischemic lesions.

N2  -  Distribution of bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactive (BrdU-IR) cell nuclei was analyzed at proximal and remote cortical sites in adult Cebus apella monkeys after a programmed surgical lesion placed either in the prefrontal or in the striate cerebral cortex. Increased GFAP-IR and vimentin-IR astrocytes, as well as IsolectinB4 labeled microglial cells, were observed both at lesional and perilesional areas. After injury at either location, the BrdU nuclear incorporation spread to supragranular layers in remote cortical areas functionally related to the injured cortex, probably due to involvement of degenerated cortico-cortical association fibers. Double labeling with Ki-67 suggested that remote BrdU-IR nuclei belong to proliferating cells, but the cell type remains to be determined, since these nuclei did not correspond to NeuN, MAP2, GFAP, Vimentin and isolectinB4 labeled cells. This remote effect should be incorporated to current clinical and experimental appraisal of cortical lesions.

N2  -  Using highly specific antisera directed against conjugated D-amino acids, the distribution Of D-glutamate-, D-tryptophan-, D-cysteine-, D-tyrosine- and D-methionine-immunoreactive structures in the rat brain was studied. Cell bodies containing D-glutamate, but not D-glutamate-immunoreactive fibers, were found. Perikarya containing this D-amino acid were only found in the mesencephalon and thalamus of the rat CNS. Thus, the highest density of cell bodies containing D-glutamate was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the ventral part of the mesencephalic central gray, the superior colliculus, above the posterior commissure, and in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus. A moderate density of immunoreactive cell bodies was observed in the dorsal part of the mesencephalic central gray, above the rostral linear nucleus of the raphe, the nucleus of Darkschewitsch, and in the medial habenular nucleus, whereas a low density was found below the medial forebrain bundle and in the posterior thalamic nuclear group. Moreover, no immunoreactive fibers or cell bodies were visualized containing D-tryptophan, D-cysteine, D-tyrosine or D-methionine in the rat brain. The distribution of D-glutamate-immunoreactive cell bodies in the rat brain suggests that this D-amino acid could be involved in several physiological mechanisms. This work reports the first visualization and the morphological characteristics of conjugated D-glutamate-immunoreactive cell bodies in the rat CNS using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Our results suggest that the immunoreactive neurons observed have an uptake mechanism for D-glutamate. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Diffusion properties of tissue are often expressed on the basis of directional variance, i.e., diffusion tensor imaging. In comparison, common perfusion-weighted imaging such as arterial spin labeling yields perfusion in a scalar quantity. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of mapping cerebral blood flow directionality using alternate ascending/descending directional navigation (ALADDIN), a recently-developed arterial spin labeling technique with sensitivity to blood flow directions. ALADDIN was applied along 3 orthogonal directions to assess directional blood flow in a vector form and also along 6 equally-spaced directions to extract blood flow tensor matrix (P) based on a blood flow ellipsoid model. Tensor elements (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc) were calculated to investigate characteristics of the blood flow tensor, in comparison with time-of-flight MR angiogram. While the directions of the main eigenvectors were heterogeneous throughout the brain, regional clusters of blood flow directionality were reproducible across subjects. The technique could show heterogeneous blood flow directionality within and around brain tumor, which was different from that of the contralateral normal side. The proposed method is deemed to provide information of blood flow directionality, which has not been demonstrated before. The results warrant further studies to assess changes in the directionality map as a function of scan parameters, to understand the signal sources, to investigate the possibility of mapping local blood perfusion directionality, and to evaluate its usefulness for clinical diagnosis.

N2  -  We investigated the relation between cognitive processing speed and structural properties of white matter pathways via convergent imaging studies in healthy and brain-injured groups. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to diffusion tensor imaging data from thirty-nine young health) subjects in order to investigate the relation between processing speed, as assessed with the Digit-Symbol subtest from WAIS-III, and fractional anisotropy, an index of microstructural organization of white matter. Digit-Symbol performance was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy of white matter in the parietal and temporal lobes bilaterally and in the left middle frontal gyrus. Fiber tractography indicated that these regions are consistent with the trajectories of the superior and interior longitudinal fasciculi. In a second investigation, we assessed the effect of white matter damage on processing speed using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis of data from seventy-two patients with left-hemisphere strokes. Lesions in left parietal white matter, together with cortical lesions in supramarginal and angular gyri were associated with impaired performance. These findings suggest that cognitive processing speed, as assessed by the Digit-Symbol test, is closely related to the structural integrity of white matter tracts associated with parietal and temporal cortices and left middle frontal gyrus. Further, fiber tractography applied to VBM results and the patient finding's suggest that file superior longitudinal fasciculus, a major tract subserving frontoparietal integration, makes a prominent contribution to processing speed.

N2  -  Background and purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal approach involving dynamic contrastenhanced (DCE) perfusion imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the preoperative imaging of brain tumors in a multicenter setting, and to evaluate the effect on diagnostic confidence and accuracy for tumor grade and type prediction. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty-three patients with brain tumors were imaged in six hospitals with a standardized multimodal protocol. Standard imaging and six parameter maps derived from DCE and DKI sequences were reviewed off-site by two independent readers. Image quality and diagnostic confidence were evaluated in qualitative analyses. Quantitative analyses were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy and the performance of DKI and DCE parameters for tumor grade differentiation and molecular tumor type determination. Results: Standardized acquisition of DCE and DKI maps was feasible with excellent image quality. Diagnostic confidence was significantly improved from 85 % to 96 % (p = 0.0005) by additional review of the DCE and DKI maps. The combination of mean kurtosis and CBV was particularly advantageous for differentiating low-grade and high-grade glioma, oligodendroglial vs. astrocytic, and IDH1/2 wild type vs. mutated tumors. Conclusion: A multimodal imaging approach with DCE and DKI improves diagnostic confidence and yields higher diagnostic accuracy for predicting tumor grade and type in adult-type glioma.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Glioma heterogeneity and the limitations of conventional structural MRI for identifying aggressive tumor components can limit the reliability of stereotactic biopsy and, hence, tumor characterization, which is a hurdle for developing and selecting effective treatment strategies. In vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) and PET enable noninvasive imaging of cellular metabolism relevant to proliferation and can detect regions of more highly active tumor. Here, the authors integrated presurgical PET and MRS with intraoperative neuronavigation to guide surgical biopsy and tumor sampling of brain gliomas with the aim of improving intraoperative tumor -tissue characterization and imaging biomarker validation.
METHODS A novel intraoperative neuronavigation tool was developed as part of a study that aimed to sample highcholine tumor components identified by multivoxel MRS and 18F-methylcholine PET-CT. Spatially coregistered PET and MRS data were integrated into structural data sets and loaded onto an intraoperative neuronavigation system. High and loW choline uptakemetabolite regions were represented as color-coded hollow spheres for targeted stereotactic biopsy and tumor sampling.; RESULTS The neurosurgeons found the 3D spherical targets readily identifiable on the interactive neuronavigation system. In one case, areas of high mitotic activity were identified on the basis of high 18F-methylcholine uptake and elevated choline ratios found with MRS in an otherwise low-grade tumor, which revealed the possible use of this technique for tumor characterization.; CONCLUSIONS These PET and MRI data can be combined and represented usefully for the surgeon in neuronavigation systems. This method enables neurosurgeons to sample tumor regions based on physiological and molecular imaging markers. The technique was applied for characterizing choline metabolism using MRS and 18F PET; however, this approach provides proof of principle for using different radionuclide tracers and other MRI methods, such as MR perfusion and diffusion.

N2  -  The present experiments determined whether traumatic lesions of the dentate gyrus granule cells had a different effect on the afferents in the molecular layer (ML) than nontraumatic lesions. Nontraumatic lesions of the granule cells induced by colchicine, ibotenic acid, x-radiation, and adrenalectomy have been reported to reduce both the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive fibers and entorhinal afferents in the ML. After the nontraumatic granule cell lesions, the laminar distribution of the entorhinal afferents was maintained in the ML, whereas the AChE laminar pattern was lost. In the present study, dentate granule cells were traumatically lesioned by a fluid injection into the infragranular cleavage plane (IGCP) of the dentate gyrus. The traumatic lesion resulted in an altered distribution of the afferents in the MIL. The perforant path fibers, shown by injection of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase into the entorhinal cortex, occupied a greater proportion of the ML in lesioned animals than in control animals. The normal laminar pattern of AChE-positive afferents was not present after the granule cell lesion. There was an initial increase in AChE-positive fibers in the ML that lasted several weeks but eventually returned to near normal levels. The altered distribution of afferents could in part be due to uneven shrinkage of the molecular layer and/or sprouting of the afferents. Granule cell suspension transplants into the IGCP also traumatically lesioned the host granule cells but immediately replaced the damaged host granule cells with immature granule cells. The distribution of afferents was similar to that found in lesioned-only animals. The traumatic lesion induced MAP2 immunoreactivity in the anisomorphic reactive astrocytes of the ML. At the longer survival times, MAP2 was not seen in either the astrocytes of the ML or in the isomorphic reactive astrocytes in CA3.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has assumed a rapidly emerging role in the diagnosis of intracranial infection; however, its usefulness in the recognition of postoperative infection has been largely unexplored. We sought to determine the ability of DWI to accurately detect a broad range of postneurosurgical infections as well as identify individual factors that may limit its applicability.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 65 patients who had undergone surgery for the confirmed diagnosis of infection between August 2001 and February 2005 and had received preoperative magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, including DWI. Fifty patients developed infections after a primary neurosurgical procedure ("postoperative" infections), whereas 15 infections occurred without antecedent intervention ("spontaneous" infections). Logistic regression analysis was-used to identify factors associated with false-negative DWI findings. Additionally, we investigated the false-positive rate of DWI by retrospectively reviewing a series of 30 consecutive patients who underwent craniotomy and received postoperative DWI.; RESULTS: Spontaneously developing cranial infections exhibited evidence of restricted diffusion in 14 out of 15 (93%) patients; however, infections that occurred postoperatively were associated with a significant false-negative rate using DWI (36%; P < 0.01). Within the subset of patients with postoperative infection, location of infection significantly correlated with the DWI false-negative rate. Infections located extradurally were less likely to demonstrate restricted diffusion compared with those located primarily within the subdural or intraparenchymal spaces. Additionally, false-positive DWI findings were observed in 11 of the 30 patients (37%) who had DWI obtained postoperatively in the absence of infection.; CONCLUSION: Utilization of DWI for the diagnosis of infection after primary neurosurgical intervention is associated with an elevated false-negative rate. The absence of restricted diffusion is not sufficient to exclude the presence of pyogenic postcraniotomy infection and should not be used as the principle determinant of patient management in this clinical setting.

N2  -  Background and objective: Phase difference enhanced imaging (PADRE), a new phase-related MRI technique, can enhance both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances, and select which phases to be enhanced. Utilizing these characteristics, we developed color map of PADRE (Color PADRE), which enables simultaneous visualization of myelin-rich structures and veins. Our aim was to determine whether Color PADRE is sufficient to delineate the characteristics of non-gadolinium-enhancing T2-hyperintense regions related with metastatic tumors (MTs), diffuse astrocytomas (DAs) and glioblastomas (GBs), and whether it can contribute to the differentiation of MTs from GBs.
Methods: Color PADRE images of 11 patients with MTs, nine with DAs and 17 with GBs were created by combining tissue-enhanced, vessel-enhanced and magnitude images of PADRE, and then retrospectively reviewed. First, predominant visibility of superficial white matter and deep medullary veins within non-gadolinium-enhancing T2-hyperintense regions were compared among the three groups. Then, the discriminatory power to differentiate MTs from GBs was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis.; Results: The degree of visibility of superficial white matter was significantly better in MTs than in GBs (p = 0.017), better in GBs than in DAs (p = 0.014), and better in MTs than in DAs (p = 0.0021). On the contrary, the difference in the visibility of deep medullary veins was not significant (p = 0.065). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to discriminate MTs from GBs was 0.76 with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 64%.; Conclusion: Visibility of superficial white matter on Color PADRE reflects inferred differences in the proportion of vasogenic edema and tumoral infiltration within non-gadolinium-enhancing T2-hyperintense regions of MTs, DAs and GBs. Evaluation of peritumoral areas on Color PADRE can help to distinguish MTs from GBs.

N2  -  In order to achieve its main goal of maximal tumor removal while avoiding postoperative neurologic deficits, neuro-oncological surgery is strongly dependent on image guidance. Among all currently available imaging modalities, MRI provides the best anatomic detail and is highly sensitive for intracranial pathology. However, conventional MRI does not detect the exact location of white matter tracts or areas of cortical activation. This essential information can be obtained non-invasively by means of diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) respectively. Here we present our initial experience with fMRI and DT-MRI for surgical planning and guidance in ten brain tumor cases.

N2  -  Objectives Comparing the diagnostic efficacy of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) derived from different region of interest (ROI) methods in tumor parenchyma for grading and predictingIDH-1mutation and 1p19q co-deletion status of glioma patients and correlating with their survival data. Methods Sixty-six patients (29 females; median age, 45 years) with pathologically proved gliomas (low-grade gliomas, 36; high-grade gliomas, 30) were prospectively included, and their clinical data were collected. All patients underwent DKI examination. DKI maps of each metric were derived. Three groups of ROIs (ten spots, ROI-10s; three biggest tumor slices, ROI-3s; and whole-tumor parenchyma, ROI-whole) were manually drawn by two independent radiologists. The interobserver consistency, time spent, diagnostic efficacy, and survival analysis of DKI metrics based on these three ROI methods were analyzed. Results The intraexaminer reliability for all parameters among these three ROI methods was good, and the time spent on ROI-10s was significantly less than that of the other two methods (p < 0.001). DKI based on ROI-10s demonstrated a slightly better diagnostic value than the other two ROI methods for grading and predicting theIDH-1mutation status of glioma, whereas DKI metrics derived from ROI-10s performed much better than those of the ROI-3s and ROI-whole in identifying 1p19q co-deletion. In survival analysis, the model based on ROI-10s that included patient age and mean diffusivity showed the highest prediction value (C-index, 0.81). Conclusions Among the three ROI methods, the ROI-10s method had the least time spent and the best diagnostic value for a comprehensive evaluation of glioma. It is an effective way to process DKI data and has important application value in the clinical evaluation of glioma.

N2  -  We describe a 4-year-old boy with posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. He exhibited bloody stool by Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection with acute renal failure. He subsequently presented high blood pressure, followed by visual disturbance and loss of consciousness. Brain MRI revealed bilateral occipital high intensities by T2-weighted images and high value by apparent diffusion coefficient map, thus we made a diagnosis of posterior reversible leukoencephaly syndrome associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In spite of immediate blood pressure control, occipital lesions developed day by day, resulting in multiple subcortical cavitations. Although posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome is originally characterized by reversible vasogenic edema, this case rarely resulted in irreversible changes with cystic formation. We concluded that precipitating factors, i.e., clotting abnormalities, Shiga toxin, vasospasms and endothelial dysfunction might have synergistically induced irreversible brain infarcts, and caused unusual cavitations.

N2  -  Thalamic white matter (WM) injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains relatively poorly understood. Combining multiple imaging modalities, sensitive to different tissue properties, may aid in further characterizing thalamic damage. Forty-five MS patients and 17 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC) were scanned with 3T MRI to obtain quantitative measures of diffusivity and magnetic susceptibility. Participants underwent cognitive evaluation with the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis battery. Tract-based spatial statistics identified thalamic WM. Non-parametric combination (NPC) analysis was used to perform joint inference on fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and magnetic susceptibility measures. The association of surrounding WM lesions and thalamic WM pathology was investigated with lesion probability mapping. Compared to HCs, the greatest extent of thalamic WM damage was reflected by the combination of increased MD and decreased magnetic susceptibility (63.0% of thalamic WM, peak p = .001). Controlling for thalamic volume resulted in decreased FA and magnetic susceptibility (34.1%, peak p = .004) as showing the greatest extent. In MS patients, the most widespread association with information processing speed was found with the combination of MD and magnetic susceptibility (67.6%, peak p = .0005), although this was not evident after controlling for thalamic volume. For memory measures, MD alone yielded the most widespread associations (45.9%, peak p = .012 or 76.7%, peak p = .001), even after considering thalamic volume, albeit with smaller percentages. White matter lesions were related to decreased FA (peak p = .0063) and increased MD (peak p = .007), but not magnetic susceptibility, of thalamic WM. Our study highlights the complex nature of thalamic pathology in MS.

N2  -  That disconnection causes clinical symptoms is a very influential concept in behavioral neurology. Criteria for subcortical disconnection usually are symptoms that are distinct from those following cortical lesions and damage to a single, long-range fiber tract. Yet, a recent study combining functional magnetic resonance imaging and fiber tracking concluded that a focal lesion in left parietal white matter provides the only tenable explanation for pure Gerstmann's syndrome, an enigmatic tetrad of acalculia, agraphia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation. Such a lesion would affect not only a single fiber tract but crossing or "kissing" of different fiber tracts and hence disconnect separate cortical networks. As fiber crossing is prominent in the cerebral white matter, the authors propose an extension to the subcortical disconnection framework that opens the door to ascribing a more diversified clinical phenomenology to white matter damage and ensuing disconnection than has been the case so far.

N2  -  Purpose Although both relaxation and diffusion imaging are sensitive to tissue microstructure, studies have reported limited sensitivity and robustness of using relaxation or conventional diffusion alone to characterize tissue microstructure. Recently, it has been shown that tensor-valued diffusion encoding and joint relaxation-diffusion quantification enable more reliable quantification of compartment-specific microstructural properties. However, scan times to acquire such data can be prohibitive. Here, we aim to simultaneously quantify relaxation and diffusion using MR fingerprinting (MRF) and b-tensor encoding in a clinically feasible time. Methods We developed multidimensional MRF scans (mdMRF) with linear and spherical b-tensor encoding (LTE and STE) to simultaneously quantify T1, T2, and ADC maps from a single scan. The image quality, accuracy, and scan efficiency were compared between the mdMRF using LTE and STE. Moreover, we investigated the robustness of different sequence designs to signal errors and their impact on the maps. Results T1 and T2 maps derived from the mdMRF scans have consistently high image quality, while ADC maps are sensitive to different sequence designs. Notably, the fast imaging steady state precession (FISP)-based mdMRF scan with peripheral pulse gating provides the best ADC maps that are free of image distortion and shading artifacts. Conclusion We demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying T1, T2, and ADC maps simultaneously from a single mdMRF scan in around 24 s/slice. The map quality and quantitative values are consistent with the reference scans.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capability and the reliability of diffusion-weighted MRI in the evaluation of normal kidney and different renal lesions. 39 patients (10 normal volunteers and 29 patients with known renal lesions) underwent MRI of the kidneys by using a 1.5 T superconducting magnet. Axial fat suppressed turbo spin echo (TSE) T-2 and coronal fast field echo (FFE) T-1 or TSE T-1 weighted images were acquired for each patient. Diffusion-weighted (DW) images were obtained in the axial plane during breath-hold (17 s) with a spin-echo echo planar imaging (SE EPI) single shot sequence (repetition time (TR)=2883 ms, echo 2 time (TE)=61 ms, flip angle=90degrees), with b value of 500 s mm(-2) 16 slices were produced with slice thickness of 7 mm and interslice gap of 1 mm. An apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was obtained at each slice position. The ADC was measured in an approximately 1 cm region of interest (ROI) within the normal renal parenchyma, the detected renal lesions and the collecting system if dilated. ADC values in normal renal parenchyma ranged from 1.72 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) to 2.65 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1), while ADC values in simple cysts (n = 13) were higher (2.87 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) to 4.00 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)). In hydronephrotic kidneys (n=6) the ADC values of renal pelvis ranged from 3.39 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) to 4.00 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1). In cases of pyonephrosis (n=3) ADC values of the renal pelvis were found to be lower than those of renal pelvis of hydronephrotic kidneys (0.77 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) to 1.07 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)). Solid benign and malignant renal tumours (n=7) showed ADC values ranging between 1.28 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) and 1.83 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1). In conclusion diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the kidney seems to be a reliable way to differentiate normal renal parenchyma and different renal diseases. Clinical experience with this method is still preliminary and further studies are required.

Further, brain changes in relation to treatment have not been investigated in TC. The objective of the present study is to compare psychosocial functioning, cognitive performance and brain (micro)structure following surgery and CT for TC, against surgery (S)-only.
MethodsTwenty-eight CT (43.17.5 y) and 23 S-only (48.29.5y) TC survivors on average 14 yr post-treatment were examined using questionnaires, neurocognitive tests, and 3T-MRI Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI), T1-weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery. A multivariate cognitive performance score (Mahalanobis distance) was calculated to indicate the grade of cognitive performance. Kurtosis parameters, gray matter, and white matter (WM) volume were calculated from MRI data.; ResultsOverall, the CT group showed lower cognitive performance (5.35 +- 1.7) compared with the S-only group (4.4 +- 0.9; P =0.03; d=0.70). Further, TC patients reported more memory problems after CT. DKI revealed a significantly higher radial kurtosis after CT in several anterior and posterior brain areas (P<0.05, corrected), but this was unrelated to cognitive performance.; ConclusionsThis cross-sectional study suggests that men receiving CT for TC are at risk for long-term lower cognitive performance. Although CT affected WM microstructure, this was unrelated to cognitive performance. More extensive, preferably prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results and to provide more insight into the possible mechanisms behind the observed cognitive sequelae after treatment for TC.

N2  -  Simple Summary The role of the blood-brain barrier in intracranial cancer treatment by vascular-disrupting agents remains unclear. Intraindividual comparison of vascular shutdown by a craniofacial metastasis model was performed, on the basis of in vivo MRI imaging, postmortem NanoCT and pathology analyses. The differential VDA therapeutic effects between intracranial and extracranial tumors were observed, with stronger vascular shutdown in the extracranial tumor. In vivo multiparametric MRI may serve as a predictor for the efficacy of VDAs on craniofacial tumors. Vascular-disrupting agents (VDAs) have shown a preliminary anti-cancer effect in extracranial tumors; however, the therapeutic potential of VDAs in intracranial metastatic lesions remains unclear. Simultaneous intracranial and extracranial tumors were induced by the implantation of rhabdomyosarcoma in 15 WAG/Rij rats. Pre-treatment characterizations were performed at a 3.0 T clinical magnet including a T2 relaxation map, T1 relaxation map, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). Shortly afterward, a VDA was intravenously given and MRI scans at 1 h, 8 h, and 24 h after treatment were performed. In vivo findings were further confirmed by postmortem angiography and histopathology staining with H&E, Ki67, and CD31. Before VDA treatment, better perfusion (AUC30: 0.067 vs. 0.058, p < 0.05) and AUC300 value (0.193 vs. 0.063, p < 0.001) were observed in extracranial lesions, compared with intracranial lesions. After VDA treatment, more significant and persistent perfusion deficiency measured by PWI (AUC30: 0.067 vs. 0.008, p < 0.0001) and a T1 map (T1 ratio: 0.429 vs. 0.587, p < 0.05) were observed in extracranial tumors, in contrast to the intracranial tumor (AUC30: 0.058 vs. 0.049, p > 0.05, T1 ratio: 0.497 vs. 0.625, p < 0.05). Additionally, significant changes in the T2 value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were observed in extracranial lesions, instead of intracranial lesions. Postmortem angiography and pathology showed a significantly larger H&E-stained area of necrosis (86.2% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.0001), lower CD31 level (42.7% vs. 54.3%, p < 0.05), and lower Ki67 level (12.2% vs. 32.3%, p < 0.01) in extracranial tumors, compared with intracranial lesions. The BBB functioned as a barrier against the delivery of VDA into intracranial tumors and multiparametric MRI may predict the efficacy of VDAs on craniofacial tumors.

N2  -  Recently, we have proposed a theoretical modified tri-exponential model for multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to measure the cytoplasmic organelle water fraction (COWF). This study aims to investigate whether COWF maps are effective in evaluating the malignant degree of gliomas and distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) from gliomas.
We performed this retrospective study based on our prospectively collected data. All patients underwent preoperative multi-bvalue DWI. Parametric maps were derived from multi-b-value DWI maps using the modified tri-exponential model. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the parameter maps. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the correlations between the parameters and the Ki-67 proliferation index.; A total of 66 patients were enrolled, including 16 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 45 high-grade gliomas (HGG), and 5 PCNSL. The mean COWF values were significantly different among LGG (3.1 +- 1.4%), HGG (6.9 +- 2.8%), and PCNSL (14.0 +- 2.2%) (P<.001). The areas under the curves of the mean COWF value in distinguishing HGG from LGG and distinguishing PCNSL from gliomas were 0.899 and 0.980, respectively. The mean COWF value had a moderate correlation with the Ki-67 proliferation index (r=0.647).; The COWF map is useful in malignant grading of gliomas, and may be helpful in distinguishing PCNSL from gliomas.

N2  -  Different portions of the SMA appear to be engaged by different types of neurological functions. It is important to identify the functional activation of SMA in terms of planning the surgical strategy. Our unpublished data from M.D. Anderson suggest that resection of the site of SMA activation based on fMRI is an important parameter for predicting the postoperative neurological deficit. Also, protecting the functional SMA during tumor resection may prevent post-operative deficit. Adjunctive non-invasive intraoperative monitoring techniques such as phase reversal of somatosensory evoked potentials, motor evoked potentials monitoring and subcortical stimulation are very important to identify the eloquent cortical brain areas during tumor resection. Delineation of subcortical pathways using diffusion tensor MRI fiber tracking with intraoperative cortical stimulation may also provide improved preservation of eloquent regions during the surgery. Use of preoperative imaging studies including fMRI, diffusion tensor MRI, intraoperative monitoring techniques and awake craniotomies together in suitable cases may minimize the incidence and severity of the SMA syndrome.

N2  -  Purpose: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is a novel technique to delineate focal areas of cytotoxic edema of various etiologies. We hypothesized that DWI may also detect the epileptogenic region and adjacent areas during the ictal and early postictal periods in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
Methods: We studied patients with intractable TLE (n = 9), due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS, n = 7), left mesial temporal lobe tumor (n = 1), and of unknown etiology (n = 1). Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study. All patients with single short seizures were scanned immediately after EEG-documented seizures (between 45 and 150 min); one of two patients in status was scanned 14 h after cessation of seizures. DWI results were analyzed visually and by calculating apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.; Results: We found significant decreases in ADC postictally in one of six patients with TLE due to HS and single short seizures. One patient with an incompletely resected temporal lobe tumor also exhibited ADC abnormalities. One patient in focal status epilepticus revealed a decrease in ADC, and one patient with a continuous aura had no DWI abnormality.; Conclusions; Postictal DWI technique may occasionally help delineate epileptic areas in some patients with TLE. Yield is low in patients with HS and single short seizures: it may be higher. in patients with tumor or status epilepticus.

N2  -  Here, we report the observation of extrapontine lesions, in addition to the Pontine lesions previously documented in a diagnosed case of hemodialysis-associated osmotic demyelination syndrome due to end-stage renal disease. The patient exhibited lesions on bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, and had been receiving regular hemodialysis as treatment for end-stage renal disease. He presented with progressive gait disturbance and postural instability. Accompanying symptoms included peduncular hallucinations and mild cognitive dysfunction. Brain MRI revealed high signal intensity in the area of bilateral cerebellar peduncles on the diffusion and T2-weighted images, with a decreased signal intensity noted on the ADC map. The ataxic form of osmotic myelinolysis syndrome is quite rare. The involvement of the cerebellar peduncles in extrapontine myelinolysis in a patient with end stage renal disease has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported. Here, we describe the MRI findings and clinical features associated with this unique case, and include a review of the relevant literature. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Background The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered a key structure in motor, behavioral, and emotional control. Although identification of the functional topography of the STN has therapeutic implications in the treatment of the motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD), the details of its functional and somatotopic organization in humans are not well understood. Objective The aim of this study was to characterize the functional organization of the STN and its correlation with the motor outcomes induced by subthalamotomy. Methods We used diffusion-weighted imaging to assess STN connectivity patterns in 23 healthy control subjects and 86 patients with PD, of whom 39 received unilateral subthalamotomy. Analytical tractography was used to reconstruct structural cortico-subthalamic connectivity. A diffusion-weighted imaging/functional magnetic resonance imaging-driven somatotopic parcellation of the STN was defined to delineate the representation of the upper and lower limb in the STN. Results We confirmed a connectional gradient to sensorimotor, supplementary-motor, associative, and limbic cortical regions, spanning from posterior-dorsal-lateral to anterior-ventral-medial portions of the STN, with intermediate overlapping zones. Functional magnetic resonance imaging-driven parcellation demonstrated dual segregation of motor cortico-subthalamic projections in humans. Moreover, the relationship between lesion topography and functional anatomy of the STN explains specific improvement in bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor induced by subthalamotomy. Conclusions Our results support an interplay between segregation and integration of cortico-subthalamic projections, suggesting the coexistence of parallel and convergent information processing. Identifying the functional topography of the STN will facilitate better definition of the optimal location for functional neurosurgical approaches, that is, electrode placement and lesion location, and improve specific cardinal features in PD.

N2  -  Objectives: This study is designed to examine the feasibility of diffusion-sensitized multishot split-echo rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) for diffusion-weighted ophthalmic imaging free of geometric distortions at 3.0 and 7.0 T in healthy volunteers and patients with intraocular masses.
Materials and Methods: A diffusion-sensitized multishot split-echo RARE (ms-RARE) variant is proposed as an alternative imaging strategy for diffusion-weighted imaging. It is compared with standard single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) and readout-segmented EPI in terms of geometric distortions in a structure phantom as well as in vivo at 3.0 and 7.0 T. To quantify geometric distortions, center of gravity analysis was carried out. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping in a diffusion phantom was performed to verify the diffusion sensitization within ms-RARE. An in vivo feasibility study in healthy volunteers (n = 10; mean age, 31 +- 7 years; mean body mass index, 22.6 +- 1.7 kgm(2)) was conducted at 3.0 and 7.0 T to evaluate clinical feasibility of ms-RARE. As a precursor to a broader clinical study, patients (n = 6; mean age, 55 +- 12 years; mean body mass index, 27.5 +- 4.7 kgm(2)) with an uveal melanoma andor retinal detachment were examined at 3.0 and 7.0 T. In 1 case, the diseased eye was enucleated as part of the therapy and imaged afterward with magnetic resonance microscopy at 9.4 T. Macrophotography and histological investigation was carried out. For qualitative assessment of the image distortion, 3 independent readers reviewed and scored ms-RARE in vivo images for all subjects in a blinded reading session. Statistical significance in the difference of the scores (a) obtained for the pooled ms-RARE datawith b = 0 and 300 smm(2) and (b) for the 3 readers was analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.; Results: The assessment of geometric integrity in phantom imaging revealed the ability of ms-RARE to produce distortion-free images. Unlike ms-RARE, modest displacements (2.3 +- 1.4 pixels) from the fast low angle shot imaging reference were observed for readout-segmented EPI, which were aggravated for single-shot EPI (8.3 +- 5.7 pixels). These observations were confirmed in the in vivo feasibility study including distortion-free diffusion-weighted ophthalmic images with a 0.5 x 0.5 x 5 mm(3) spatial resolution at 3.0 T and as good as 0.2 x 0.2 x 2 mm(3) at 7.0 T. The latter represents a factor of 40 enhancement in spatial resolution versus clinical protocols recently reported for diffusion-weighted imaging of the eye at 1.5 T. Mean ADC values within the vitreous body were (2.91 +- 0.14) x 10(-3) mm(2)s at 3.0 T and (2.93 +- 0.41) x 10(-3) mm(2)s at 7.0 T. Patient data showed severe retinal detachment in the anatomical images. Whereas the tumor remained undetected in T-1-weighted and T-2-weighted imaging at 3.07.0 T, in vivo ADC mapping using ms-RARE revealed the presence of a uveal melanoma with a significant contrast versus the surrounding subretinal hemorrhage. This observation was confirmed by high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance microscopy and histology. Qualitative analysis of image distortion in ms-RARE images obtained for all subjects yielded a mean +- SD image quality score of 1.06 +- 0.25 for b = 0 smm(2) and of 1.17 +- 0.49 for b = 300 smm(2). No significant interreader differences were observed for ms-RARE with a diffusion sensitization of b = 0 smm(2) and 300 smm(2).; Conclusions: This work demonstrates the capability of diffusion-sensitized ms-RARE to acquire high-contrast, high-spatial resolution, distortion-free images of the eye and the orbit at 3.0 and 7.0 T. Geometric distortions that are observed for EPI-based imaging approaches even at lower field strengths are offset by fast spin-echo-based imaging techniques. The benefits of this improvement can be translated into the assessment of spatial arrangements of the eye segments and their masses with the ultimate goal to provide guidance during diagnostic treatment of ophthalmological diseases.

N2  -  Spectroscopic stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a label-free technique that generates chemical maps of live cells or tissues. A handheld SRS imaging system using an optical fiber for laser delivery will further enable in situ and in vivo compositional analysis for applications such as medical diagnosis and surgical guidance. In fiber-delivered SRS, the interaction of two ultrashort pulses in the confined mode area creates a significant background that overwhelms the stimulated Raman signal from a sample. Here, we report the first background-free fiber-delivered handheld SRS microscope for in situ chemical imaging. By temporally separating the two ultrafast pulses propagating in the fiber and then overlapping them on a sample through a highly dispersive material, we detected a stimulated Raman signal that is 200 times weaker than the background induced by the fiber. Broad applications of the handheld SRS microscope were demonstrated through in situ ambient-light chemical mapping of pesticide on a spinach leaf, cancerous tissue versus healthy brain tissue in a canine model, and cosmetic distribution on live human skin. A lab-built objective lens further reduced the size of the pen-shaped microscope to about one centimeter in diameter.

N2  -  Purpose: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has become an important component in modern stroke imaging. This MR technique detects diffusion abnormalities, which can be quantified by computing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. ADC values are typically calculated from a set of MR images obtained with varying degrees of diffusion weighting (b-values) using nonlinear regression. However, there is no agreement concerning the number of images needed for ADC calculation. The aim of our study was to determine how many b-values are necessary to reliably calculate ADC maps.
Materials and Methods: In 100 consecutive patients with clinical signs of acute ischemic stroke, 6 identically oriented and centered diffusion data sets with different b-values were acquired. ROI analysis was performed for DWI-positive lesions, normal-appearing gray and white matter. CSF, and background noise. ADC values for each ROI were calculated using a nonlinear regression model. Additionally, the CNR and SNR were calculated for each ROI.; Results: Acquisition time was 0:39 min for 2 b-values and up to 2:49 min for a sequence with 7 b-values. The mean ADC (x 10(-3) mm(2)s) for ischemic lesions was 58.29, 58.47, 57.83, 57.81, 57.58 and 54.51 using 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 b-values. Ischemic lesions had significantly different mean ADC values only for high b-values (b = 2000 smm(2)).; Conclusion: ADC values call be reliably calculated using 2 b-values. Radiologists may use the more time-efficient 2-point method for reliably estimating ADC values and detecting ischemic lesions in the daily clinical routine.

N2  -  Chemical-exchange spin-lock (CESL) MRI can map regional uptake and utilisation of glucose in the brain at high spatial resolution (i.e sub 0.2 mm(3) voxels). We propose two quantitative kinetic models to describe glucose-induced changes in tissue R-1 rho and apply them to glucoCESL MRI data acquired in tumour-bearing and healthy rats. When assuming glucose transport is saturable, the maximal transport capacity (T-max) measured in normal tissue was 3.2 +/- 0.6 mu mol/min/mL, the half saturation constant (K-t) was 8.8 +/- 2.2 mM, the metabolic rate of glucose consumption (MRglc) was 0.21 +/- 0.13 mu mol/min/mL, and the cerebral blood volume (v(b)) was 0.006 +/- 0.005 mL/mL. Values in tumour were: T-max = 7.1 +/- 2.7 mu mol/min/mL, K-t = 14 +/- 1.7 mM, MRglc = 0.22 +/- 0.09 mu mol/min/mL, v(b) = 0.030 +/- 0.035 mL/mL. T-max and K-t were significantly higher in tumour tissue than normal tissue (p = 0.006 and p = 0.011, respectively). When assuming glucose uptake also occurs via free diffusion, the free diffusion rate (k(d)) was 0.061 +/- 0.017 mL/min/mL in normal tissue and 0.12 +/- 0.042 mL/min/mL in tumour. These parameter estimates agree well with literature values obtained using other approaches (e.g. NMR spectroscopy).

N2  -  Currently, a reliable method for real-time prediction of ischemia in the human brain is not available. Here, we took a first step towards validating non-invasive intraoperative laser speckle imaging (iLSI) for prediction of infarction in 22 patients undergoing decompressive surgery for treatment of malignant hemispheric stroke. During surgery, cortical perfusion was visualized and recorded in real-time with iLSI. The true morphological infarct extension within the iLSI imaging field was superimposed onto the iLSI blood flow maps according to a postoperative MRI (16 h [95% CI: 13, 19] after surgery) with three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo and diffusion-weighted imaging reconstruction. Based on the frequency distribution of iLSI perfusion values within the infarcted and non-infarcted territories, probability curves and perfusion thresholds of normalized cerebral blood flow predictive of eventual infarction or non-infarction were calculated. Intraoperative LSI predicted and excluded cortical ischemia with 95% probability at normalized perfusion levels below 40% and above 110%, respectively, which represented 73% of the entire cortical surface area. Together, our results suggest that iLSI is valid for (pseudo-) quantitative assessment of blood flow in the human brain and may be used to identify tissue at risk for infarction at a given time-point in the course of ischemic stroke.

N2  -  Objectives: We investigated changes in the optic tract and optic radiation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing unilateral and bilateral optic nerve damage assessed based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) using advanced diffusion MR metrics.
Methods: In 21 MS patients, diffusion MRI was performed. Maps of fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and mean kurtosis (MM) were computed. On the basis of the P100 latency in VEPs, the MS patients were divided into three groups: bilateral (n = 7), unilateral (n = 7), and no abnormality (n = 7). Their optic tracts and optic radiations were analyzed with diffusion MRI-based fiber tracking. We also investigated the correlations between diffusion parameters and VEPs (n = 21).; Results: In the optic tract, the diffusion changes in each of the three groups showed step-like changes. The diffusion changes in the optic radiations of the unilateral group were similar to those in the normal VEP group. Only the bilateral group showed significantly higher ADC and lower MM relative to the other two groups (P < 0.05, Steel-Dwass multiple-comparison test). A significant positive correlation between VEP latency and ADC and a significant negative correlation between VEP latency and MM were observed (P < 0.01, Spearman's correction).; Conclusions: We first evaluated the relationship between VEPs and DMI and concluded that the lateral geniculate nucleus may compensate for unilateral damage in the pre-geniculate optic pathway via neural plasticity.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioblastoma and primary CNS lymphoma dictate different neurosurgical strategies; it is critical to distinguish them preoperatively. However, current imaging modalities do not effectively differentiate them. We aimed to examine the use of DWI and T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced-MR imaging as potential discriminative tools.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 18 patients with primary CNS lymphoma and 36 matched patients with glioblastoma with pretreatment DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced-MR imaging. VOIs were drawn around the tumor on contrast-enhanced T1WI and FLAIR images; these images were transferred onto coregistered ADC maps to obtain the ADC and onto dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion maps to obtain the plasma volume and permeability transfer constant. Histogram analysis was performed to determine the mean and relative ADC(mean) and relative 90th percentile values for plasma volume and the permeability transfer constant. Nonparametric tests were used to assess differences, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for optimal threshold calculations.; RESULTS: The enhancing component of primary CNS lymphoma was found to have significantly lower ADC(mean) (1.1 x 10(-3) versus 1.4 x 10(-3); P < .001) and relative ADC(mean) (1.5 versus 1.9; P < .001) and relative 90th percentile values for plasma volume (3.7 versus 5.0; P < .05) than the enhancing component of glioblastoma, but not significantly different relative 90th percentile values for the permeability transfer constant (5.4 versus 4.4; P = .83). The nonenhancing portions of glioblastoma and primary CNS lymphoma did not differ in these parameters. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis, mean ADC provided the best threshold (area under the curve = 0.83) to distinguish primary CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma, which was not improved with normalized ADC or the addition of perfusion parameters.; CONCLUSIONS: ADC was superior to dynamic contrast-enhanced-MR imaging perfusion, alone or in combination, in differentiating primary CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Brain tumors involving the primary motor cortex are often deemed unresectable due to the potential neurological consequences that result from injury to this region. Nevertheless, we have challenged this dogma for many years and used asleep, as well as awake, intraoperative stimulation mapping to maximize extent of resection. It remains unclear whether these tumors can be resected with acceptable morbidity, whether performing the surgery with the patient awake or asleep impacts extent of resection, and how stimulation mapping influences outcomes.
METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on the senior author's cohort to identify patients treated between 1998 and 2016 who underwent resection of tumors that were located within the primary motor cortex. Clinical notes, operative reports, and radiographic images were reviewed to identify intraoperative stimulation mapping findings and functional outcomes following tumor resection. Extent of resection was quantified volumetrically. Characteristics of patients were analyzed to identify factors associated with postoperative motor deficits.; RESULTS Forty-nine patients underwent 53 resections of tumors located primarily within the motor cortex. Stimulation mapping was performed in all cases. Positive cortical sites for motor response were identified in 91% of cases, and subcortical sites in 74%. Awake craniotomy was performed in 65% of cases, while 35% were done under general anesthesia. The mean extent of resection was 91%. There was no statistically significant difference in extent of resection in cases done awake compared with those done under general anesthesia. New or worsened postoperative motor deficits occurred in 32 patients (60%), and 20 patients (38%) had a permanent deficit. Of the permanent deficits, 14 were mild, 4 were moderate, and 2 were severe (3.8% of cases). Decreased intraoperative motor response and diffusion restriction on postoperative MRI were associated with permanent deficit. Awake motor mapping surgery was associated with increased diffusion signal on postoperative MRI.; CONCLUSIONS Resection of tumors from the primary motor cortex is associated with an increased risk of motor deficit, but most of these deficits are transient or mild and have little functional impact. Excellent extent of resection can be achieved with intraoperative stimulation mapping, suggesting that these tumors are indeed amenable to resection and should not be labeled unresectable. Injury to small perforating or en passage blood vessels was the most common cause of infarction that led to moderate or severe deficits. Awake motor mapping was not superior to mapping done under general anesthesia with regard to long-term functional outcome.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate whether diffusion mapping could lateralize intractable seizures in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients. Background: Animal seizure models show acute postictal depression of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC,), interictal normalization, then chronic elevation. Methods: The hippocampal plane was imaged with five diffusion weightings along each axis. Three orthogonal ADC, maps were averaged to produce an isotropic ADC, map. Results: In all eight MTLE patients, ADC, was elevated by a mean of 10 +/- 3% (p < 0.01, paired t-test) interictally in the ipsilateral hippocampus, where side of seizure focus was determined electrographically with corroboration by volumetric MRI studies. Measured ADC, values in phantoms and five normal brains agree with published values. Conclusions: Brain tissue with interictally increased ADC, may represent an epileptogenic region with neuronal loss, gliosis, and expanded extracellular space (hippocampal sclerosis). Thus, diffusion mapping may confirm seizure lateralization.

N2  -  PurposeIn brain tumor dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI studies, multiecho acquisition methods are used to quantify the dynamic changes in T-1 and T-2* that occur when contrast agent (CA) extravasates. Such methods also enable the estimation of the effective tissue CA transverse relaxivity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of the transverse relaxivity at tracer equilibrium (TRATE) to tumor cytoarchitecture.
MethodsComputational and in vitro studies were used to evaluate the biophysical basis of TRATE. In 9L, C6, and human brain tumors, TRATE, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the CA transfer constant (K-trans), the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (v(e)), and histological data were compared.; ResultsSimulations and in vitro results indicate that TRATE is highly sensitive to variations in cellular properties such as cell size and density. The histologic cell density and TRATE values were significantly higher in 9L tumors as compared to C6 tumors. In animal and human tumors, a voxel-wise comparison of TRATE with ADC, v(e), and K-trans maps showed low spatial correlation.; ConclusionThe assessment of TRATE is clinically feasible and its sensitivity to tissue cytoarchitectural features not present in other imaging methods indicate that it could potentially serve as a unique structural signature or trait of cancer.

N2  -  Identification and localization of ischemic stroke (IS) lesions is routinely performed to confirm diagnosis, assess stroke severity, predict disability and plan rehabilitation strategies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In basic research, stroke lesion segmentation is necessary to study complex peri-infarction tissue changes. Moreover, final stroke volume is a critical outcome evaluated in clinical and preclinical experiments to determine therapy or intervention success. Manual segmentations are performed but they require a specialized skill set, are prone to inter-observer variation, are not entirely objective and are often not supported by histology. The task is even more challenging when dealing with large multi-center datasets, multiple experimenters or large animal cohorts. On the other hand, current automatized segmentation approaches often lack histological validation, are not entirely user independent, are often based on single parameters, or in the case of complex machine learning methods, require vast training datasets and are prone to a lack of model interpretation.
Methods: We induced IS using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model on two rat cohorts. We acquired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2W) images at 24 h and 1-week after IS induction. Subsets of the animals at 24 h and 1-week post IS were evaluated using histology and immunohistochemistry. Using a Gaussian mixture model, we segmented voxel-wise interactions between ADC and T2W parameters at 24 h using one of the rat cohorts. We then used these segmentation results to train a random forest classifier, which we applied to the second rat cohort. The algorithms' stroke segmentations were compared to manual stroke delineations, T2W and ADC thresholding methods and the final stroke segmentation at 1-week. Volume correlations to histology were also performed for every segmentation method. Metrics of success were calculated with respect to the final stroke volume. Finally, the trained random forest classifier was tested on a human dataset with a similar temporal stroke on-set. Manual segmentations, ADC and T2W thresholds were again used to evaluate and perform comparisons with the proposed algorithms' output.; Results: In preclinical rat data our framework significantly outperformed commonly applied automatized thresholding approaches and segmented stroke regions similarly to manual delineation. The framework predicted the localization of final stroke regions in 1-week post-stroke MRI with a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86, Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.80 and false positive rate of 0.04. The predicted stroke volumes also strongly correlated with final histological stroke regions (Pearson correlation = 0.88, P < 0.0001). Lastly, the stroke region characteristics identified by our framework in rats also identified stroke lesions in human brains, largely outperforming thresholding approaches in stroke volume prediction (P<0.01).; Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the segmentation produced by our proposed framework using 24 h MRI rat data strongly correlated with the final stroke volume, denoting a predictive effect. In addition, we show for the first time that the stroke imaging features can be directly translated between species, allowing identification of acute stroke in humans using the model trained on animal data. This discovery reduces the gap between the clinical and preclinical fields, unveiling a novel approach to directly co-analyze clinical and preclinical data. Such methods can provide further biological insights into human stroke and highlight the differences between species in order to help improve the experimental setups and animal models of the disease.

N2  -  One third of patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy have normal-appearing MRI scans. This poses a problem as identification of the epileptogenic region is required for surgical treatment. This study performs a multimodal voxel-based analysis (VBA) to identify brain abnormalities in MRI-negative focal epilepsy. Data was collected from 69 focal epilepsy patients (42 with discrete lesions on MRI scans, 27 with no visible findings on scans), and 62 healthy controls. MR images comprised T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging, and neurite density index (NDI) from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging. These multimodal images were coregistered to T1-weighted scans, normalized to a standard space, and smoothed with 8 mm FWHM. Initial analysis performed voxel-wise one-tailed t-tests separately on grey matter concentration (GMC), FLAIR, FA, MD, and NDI, comparing patients with epilepsy to controls. A multimodal non-parametric combination (NPC) analysis was also performed simultaneously on FLAIR, FA, MD, and NDI. Resulting p-maps were family-wise error rate corrected, thresholdfree cluster enhanced, and thresholded at p < 0.05. Sensitivity was established through visual comparison of results to manually drawn lesion masks or seizure onset zone (SOZ) from stereoelectroencephalography. A leaveone-out cross-validation with the same analysis protocols was performed on controls to determine specificity. NDI was the best performing individual modality, detecting focal abnormalities in 38% of patients with normal MRI and conclusive SOZ. GMC demonstrated the lowest sensitivity at 19%. NPC provided superior performance to univariate analyses with 50% sensitivity. Specificity in controls ranged between 96 and 100% for all analyses. This study demonstrated the utility of a multimodal VBA utilizing NPC for detecting epileptogenic lesions in MRInegative focal epilepsy. Future work will apply this approach to datasets from other centres and will experiment with different combinations of MR sequences.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: Bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage is extremely rare clinical entity but relatively known as postoperative neurosurgical complication with as-yet unknown etiology. Here, we report a case of bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage due to pial arteriovenous fistula (pAVF) and discuss the possible pathophysiology of this bleeding pattern.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old boy who was previously healthy presented with a sudden onset of headache, vomiting, and gait instability. Computed tomography revealed atypical bleeding in the sulci of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres facing the tentorium. Despite the symmetric distribution of bleeding, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed flow void adjacent to the lateral margin of bleeding. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed increased apparent diffusion coefficient value in the hemorrhagic lesion, suggesting vasogenic edema. Vertebral angiogram revealed a pAVF, which was fed by the hemispheric branch of superior cerebellar artery. It drained via the venous varix, inferiorly into the tortuous and engorged inferior hemispheric vein, indicating venous congestion. On the venous phase of vertebral angiogram, the superior vermian vein, which is one of the main drainers of the superior part of the cerebellum, was not opacified. Transarterial n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate embolization was performed to prevent rebleeding, and the pAVF was treated successfully. The patient's follow-up has been uneventful for 3 years.; CONCLUSIONS: We reported an extremely rare case of cerebellar pAVF presenting as bilateral upper cerebellar hemorrhage. Severe congestion of upper cerebellar veins seemed to be a possible pathophysiology of this specific bleeding pattern.

N2  -  Background: After perinatal brain injury, clinico-anatomic correlations of functional deficits and brain plasticity remain difficult to evaluate clinically in the young infant. Thus, new non-invasive methods capable of early functional diagnosis are needed in young infants.
Case Presentation: The visual system recovery in an infant with perinatal stroke is assessed by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and event-related functional MRI (ER-fMRI). All experiments were done at 1.5T. A first DTI experiment was performed at 12 months of age. At 20 months of age, a second DTI experiment was performed and combined with an ER-fMRI experiment with visual stimuli (2 Hz visual flash). At 20 months of age, ER-fMRI showed significant negative activation in the visual cortex of the injured left hemisphere that was not previously observed in the same infant. DTI maps suggest recovery of the optic radiation in the vicinity of the lesion. Optic radiations in the injured hemisphere are more prominent in DTI at 20 months of age than in DTI at 12 months of age.; Conclusion: Our data indicate that functional cortical recovery is supported by structural modifications that concern major pathways of the visual system. These neuroimaging findings might contribute to elaborate a pertinent strategy in terms of diagnosis and rehabilitation.

N2  -  In the repeatability analysis, when the measurement is the mean value of a parametric map within a region of interest (ROI), the ROI size becomes important as by increasing the size, the measurement will have a smaller variance. This is important in decision-making in prospective clinical studies of brain when the ROI size is variable, e.g., in monitoring the effect of treatment on lesions by quantitative MRI, and in particular when the ROI is small, e.g., in the case of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis. Thus, methods to estimate repeatability measures for arbitrary sizes of ROI are desired. We propose a statistical model of the values of parametric map within the ROI and a method to approximate the model parameters, based on which we estimate a number of repeatability measures including repeatability coefficient, coefficient of variation, and intraclass correlation coefficient for an ROI with an arbitrary size. We also show how this gives an insight into related problems such as spatial smoothing in voxel-wise analysis. Experiments are conducted on simulated data as well as on scan-rescan brain MRI of healthy subjects. The main application of this study is the adjustment of the decision threshold based on the lesion size in treatment monitoring.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of 3-T MRI of the prostate using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with high b values (1,000 and 2,000 s/mm(2)) and a phased-array coil in predicting localized prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients underwent single-shot echo-planar DWI at 3 T, followed by radical prostatectomy. DWI was performed at high b values of 1,000 and 2,000 smm(2). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were analyzed by visual and quantitative assessment for tumor and benign tissue in the peripheral and transition zones. The visual and quantitative results of ADC maps obtained at b values of 1,000 and 2,000 smm(2) were compared with the histopathologic findings.; RESULTS. To predict localized prostate cancer, the sensitivity of ADC maps obtained at a b value of 1,000 versus 2,000 smm(2) was 88% and 71%, respectively, and the accuracy was 89% and 86% (p < 0.01). The mean ADC values of tumors in both the peripheral and transition zones were significantly lower than those of benign tissues at both b values of 1,000 and 2,000 smm(2) (p < 0.001).; CONCLUSION. Prostate DWI performed at 3 T using high b values was able to improve differentiation of tumors from benign tissue. DWI performed using a b value of 1,000 smm(2) was more sensitive and more accurate in predicting localized prostate cancer than DWI performed using a b value of 2,000 smm(2).

N2  -  Objective: The objective of this paper is to inform the pathophysiology of medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) axonal dysfunction in patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to multiple sclerosis (MS), and develop a composite structural-functional biomarker of axonal and myelin integrity in this tract.
Methods: Eighteen patients with definite MS and clinically suspected INO underwent electrical vestibular stimulation and search-coil eye movement recording. Components of the electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (eVOR) were analyzed to probe the latency and fidelity of MLF axonal conduction. The MLF and T-2-visible brainstem lesions were defined by high-resolution MRI. White matter integrity was determined by diffusion-weighted imaging metrics.; Results: eVOR onset latency was positively correlated with MLF lesion length (left: r = 0.66, p = 0.004; right: r = 0.75, p = 0.001). The mean conduction velocity (SD) within MLF lesions was estimated at 2.72 (+- 0.87) ms. eVOR onset latency correlated with normalized axial diffusivity (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and fractional anisotropy (r = 0.44, p = 0.02) after exclusion of cases with ipsilateral vestibular root entry zone lesions.; Conclusions: Axonal conduction velocity through lesions involving the MLF was reduced below levels predicted for natively myelinated and remyelinated axons. Composite in vivo biomarkers enable delineation of axonal from myelin processes and may provide a crucial role in assessing efficacy of novel reparative therapies in MS.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The premotor cortex (PMC) is known to have a dual role in movement and language processing. Nevertheless, surgical outcomes of brain arteriovenous malformations located in PMC (PMC-BAVMs) have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to determine surgical outcomes and risk factors for neurologic deficits (NDs) after surgery in patients with PMC-BAVMs.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with PMC-BAVMs who underwent surgical resection of the nidus. All patients had undergone preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional time-offlight magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. Functional and angioarchitectural factors were analyzed with respect to postoperative NDs. Function-related fiber tracts, corticospinal tract, and dominant arcuate fasciculus were tracked. Lesion-to-fiber distance was measured.; RESULTS: We identified 36 patients with PMC-BAVMs. Radical resection was achieved in all patients. Four patients (11.1%) presented with limb-kinetic apraxia and bradykinesia. Short-term NDs developed in 12 (33.3%) patients, among which 6 developed aphasias and 7 developed muscle weakness. A shorter lesion-to-eloquent fiber distance (P = 0.012) and larger nidus size (P = 0.048) were significantly associated with short-term NDs. Long-term NDs occurred in 5 patients. Larger nidus size was significantly associated (P = 0.015) with long-term NDs.; CONCLUSIONS: Varying degrees of motor and language deficits can be induced immediately after resection of PMC-BAVMs. Permanent and long-term severe motor or language deficits are rare. Shorter lesion-to-eloquent fiber distance is a risk factor for short-term NDs. Larger nidus size is a risk factor for short-term and long-term NDs.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have reported abnormal changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by histogram and region-of-interest-based methods by using diffusion tenor imaging. However, there are few studies on specific white matter fiber tracts of BBMS. Our study sought to use diffusion tensor tractography-based group mapping to investigate the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing pyramidal tract (PYT) of BBMS and its possible mechanism.
METHODS: A PYT probability map was first constructed from data on 20 healthy patients based on the deterministic-based tractography method. The PYT probability map was then applied to 29 RRMS patients to calculate diffusion indices of the PYT. In this study, 4 quantitative indices-fractional anisotropy (FA), directionally averaged diffusion coefficient (D-av), axial diffusion coefficient (lambda(1)), and radial diffusion coefficient (lambda(23))-were used to characterize the abnormal diffusion.; RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, RRMS patients had a significantly higher D-av and lambda(23) but a lower FA and a trend toward a lower lambda(1) in the normal-appearing PYT. In RRMS patients, PYT lesions had a significantly higher lambda(23) and a lower FA, but there were no differences for D-av and lambda(1) when compared with the normal-appearing PYT. Moreover, the diffusion indices derived from the normal-appearing PYT were significantly correlated with PYT lesion volumes by using the Spearman correlation analysis.; CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in the normal-appearing PYT of RRMS patients and suggest that wallerian degeneration might be its mechanism.

T2  -  EXPERT REVIEW OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY

N2  -  Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common and potentially devastating neuropsychiatric complication of acute liver failure and cirrhosis. Even in its mildest form, minimal HE (MHE), the syndrome significantly impacts daily living and heralds progression to overt HE. There is maturity in the scientific understanding of the cellular processes that lead to functional and structural abnormalities in astrocytes. Hyperammonemia and subsequent cell swelling is a key pathophysiological abnormality, but this aspect alone is insufficient to fully explain the complex neurotransmitter abnormalities that may be observable using sophisticated imaging techniques. Inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species activation and the role of neurosteroids on neurotransmitter binding sites are emerging pathological lines of inquiry that have yielded important new information on the processes underlying HE and offer promise of future therapeutic targets. Overt HE remains a clinical diagnosis and the neurophysiological and imaging modalities used in research studies have not transferred successfully to the clinical situation. MHE is best characterized by psychometric evaluation, but these tests can be lengthy to perform and require specific expertise to interpret. Simpler computer-based tests are now available and perhaps offer an opportunity to screen, diagnose and monitor MHE in a clinical scenario, although large-scale studies comparing the different techniques have not been undertaken. There is a discrepancy between the depth of understanding of the pathophysiology of HE and the translation of this understanding to a simple, easily understood diagnostic and longitudinal marker of disease. This is a present area of focus for the management of HE.

N2  -  This presentation will focus on the value of established and newer MR methods that can be applied to the diagnosis and management of ischemic stroke with emphasis on future applications of MR to provide previously unmet needs of the treating clinician and clinical trials. Time alone is an inadequate indicator of the therapeutic window, especially when the time of stroke onset is uncertain. Thus, there is a need to predict the evolution of stroke in a way that more precisely and with greater resolution identifies the progression of cellular damage at the moment of investigation. This also would be of value for thrombolysis when knowledge of the degree and extent of tissue necrosis and the consequent potential for brain hemorrhage is of the utmost importance. To provide this, we perform postprocessing of diffusion-, T-1- and T-2-weighted images to produce the apparent diffusion coefficient of water, and T-1 and T-2 maps that are then further processed to provide maps and quantitation of the tissue signatures of ischemic histopathology. By these means, we can accomplish objective volumetric analysis of infarct size and of the proportions of potentially viable and salvageable tissue. We will show how this has the potential to predict long-term stroke outcome and facilitate decision-making in terms of safety of reperfusion strategies and the appropriateness of cytoprotective treatment. The value of our approach is to replace time as the therapeutic window and extend the opportunity of treatment to those patients presenting beyond the stringent time limits employed in current investigative clinical trials. Further, used as a surrogate marker of clinical outcome, this form of stroke analysis may speed proof of principle clinical trials in small numbers of stroke patients. Copyright (C) 2001 S.

N2  -  Rationale: "Nine" syndrome, that is "eight-and-a-half" syndrome associated with hemiplegia and hemidysesthesia, is a rare disorder. This study aimed to report a Chinese patient with acute bilateral pontine infarction manifesting as eight-and-a-half syndrome plus hemiplegia (atypical nine syndrome), and also the clinical and neuroimaging findings were explained and discussed with review of the literature.
Patient concerns: A 79-year-old woman experienced sudden vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and weakness at her left arm and leg. The neurological examination disclosed her right horizontal gaze palsy, internuclear ophtalmoplegia (INO), and right-sided peripheral facial paralysis combined with slight left-sided hemiplegia, which were consistent with atypical nine syndrome.; Diagnoses: Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed acute multiple ischemic infarction, involving bilateral pontine tegmentum, basilar part of right paramedian pontine, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Intracranial MR angiography (MRA) revealed right middle cerebral artery occlusion, no clear visualization of bilateral vertebral arteries, and basilar artery hypoplasia with stenotic segments.; Interventions: Thrombolysis could not be performed due to the time window. The patient was given low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation because of posterior circulation and progressive stroke.; Outcomes: The vertigo disappeared, and a notable improvement with minimal restriction in the right horizontal gaze and partial relief of her facial paralysis were found at discharge, while her left hemiparesis was fully resolved. No recurrence of cerebral infarction was observed during follow-up as well.; Lessons: This case report with atypical nine syndrome is fairly rare. Nine syndrome may refer to the lesion located in unilateral tegmentum of the caudal pontine plus paramedian pontine, with an important localization value.

N2  -  The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the possible identification of trajectories of fibre tracts, (2) to examine the useful of a neuronavigation system for pre-surgical planning, (3) to assess pre- and post-surgery patients' clinical condition and (4) to evaluate the impact of this information on surgical planning and procedure. Twenty-eight right-handed patients were prospectively and consecutively studied. All the patients were clinically assessed by a neurologist in both pre- and post-surgical phases. Separately the pyramidal tract, optic radiation and arcuate fasciculus were reconstructed. The trajectories were considered suitable for surgical planning if there were no interruptions of any of the layers at the level of the lesion. Dedicated software 'merged' the acquired images with the tractographic processing, and the whole dataset was sent to the neuronavigation system. The assessment of the 37 visualised trajectories close to the tumour resulted in a modification of the surgical approach to corticotomy in six patients (21%); the impact on the definition of the resection margins during surgery was 64% (18 cases). The overall impact percentage on the surgical procedure was 82%. In 27 cases, the symptoms had not changed. MR-tractography provides the neurosurgeon with a new anatomical view that has an impact on the surgical resection planning for brain neoplasms.

N2  -  Background High radiation doses of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM) can increase the likelihood of radiation necrosis (RN). Advanced MRI sequences can improve the differentiation between RN and tumor progression (TP). Purpose To use saturation transfer MRI methods including chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and magnetization transfer (MT) to distinguish RN from TP. Study Type Prospective cohort study. Subjects Seventy patients (median age 60; 73% females) with BM (75 lesions) post-SRS. Field Strength/Sequence 3-T, CEST imaging using low/high-power (saturation B-1 = 0.52 and 2.0 mu T), quantitative MT imaging using B-1 = 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mu T, WAter Saturation Shift Referencing (WASSR), WAter Shift And B-1 (WASABI), T-1, and T-2 mapping. All used gradient echoes except T-2 mapping (gradient and spin echo). Assessment Voxel-wise metrics included: magnetization transfer ratio (MTR); apparent exchange-dependent relaxation (AREX); MTR asymmetry; normalized MT exchange rate and pool size product; direct water saturation peak width; and the observed T-1 and T-2. Regions of interests (ROIs) were manually contoured on the post-Gd T(1)w. The mean (of median ROI values) was compared between groups. Clinical outcomes were determined by clinical and radiologic follow-up or histopathology. Statistical Tests t-Test, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic, and area under the curve (AUC) with sensitivity/specificity values with the optimal cut point using the Youden index, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Cohen's d. P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction was considered significant. Results Seven metrics showed significant differences between RN and TP. The high-power MTR showed the highest AUC of 0.88, followed by low-power MTR (AUC = 0.87). The combination of low-power CEST scans improved the separation compared to individual parameters (with an AIC of 70.3 for low-power MTR/AREX). Cohen's d effect size showed that the MTR provided the largest effect sizes among all metrics. Data Conclusion Significant differences between RN and TP were observed based on saturation transfer MRI. Evidence Level: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2

N2  -  MR-based differentiation between low- and high-grade gliomas is predominately based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1w). However, functional MR sequences as perfusion- and diffusion-weighted sequences can provide additional information on tumor grade. Here, we tested the potential of a recently developed similarity search based method that integrates information of CE-T1w and perfusion maps for non-invasive MR-based glioma grading.
We prospectively included 37 untreated glioma patients (23 grade III, 14 grade III gliomas), in whom 3T MRI with FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, and perfusion sequences was performed. Cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, and mean transit time maps as well as CE-T1w images were used as input for the similarity search. Data sets were preprocessed and converted to four-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models that considered correlations between the different MR sequences. For each patient, a so-called tumor feature vector (= probability-based classifier) was defined and used for grading. Biopsy was used as gold standard, and similarity based grading was compared to grading solely based on CE-T1w.; Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of pure CE-T1w based glioma grading were 64.9%, 78.6%, and 56.5%, respectively. Similarity search based tumor grading allowed differentiation between low-grade (I or II) and high-grade (III) gliomas with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83.8%, 78.6%, and 87.0%.; Our findings indicate that integration of perfusion parameters and CE-T1w information in a semi-automatic similarity search based analysis improves the potential of MR-based glioma grading compared to CE-T1w data alone.

N2  -  An 18-year-old girl presented with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) following surgery for craniopharyngioma. Postoperatively, the patient developed diabetes insipidus with remarkable fluctuation of serum sodium level, suffered a seizure, and developed mental state changes and quadriparesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging obtained soon after the development of the symptoms showed no significant abnormalities. MR imaging obtained 2 months later demonstrated typical trident or bat-like signal abnormalities in the center of the pons, compatible with CPM. Serial MR imaging obtained at 7 and 10 months showed the lesion had decreased in size or almost completely resolved and the patient almost completely recovered. CPM is well known, but neurosurgeons should consider the possibility following surgery for craniopharyngioma.

N2  -  Understanding the contribution of the brain white matter pathways to declarative verbal memory processes has been hindered by the lack of an adequate model in humans. An attractive and underexplored approach to study white matter region functionality in the living human brain is through the use of non-aprioristic models which specifically search disrupted white matter pathways. For this purpose, we employed voxel-based lesion-function mapping to correlate white matter lesions on the magnetic resonance images of 46 multiple sclerosis patients with their performance on declarative verbal memory storage and retrieval. White matter correlating with storage was in the temporal lobe-particularly lateral to the hippocampus and in the anterior temporal stem-, in the thalamic region and in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, all on the left hemisphere, and also in the right anterior temporal stem. The same volumes were relevant for retrieval, but to them were added temporo-parieto-frontal paramedian bundles, particularly the cingulum and the fronto-occipital fasciculus. These 3D maps indicate the white matter regions most critically involved in declarative verbal memory in humans. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical relevance of microembolism in one hundred unselected patients submitted to 50 carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and 50 carotid stenting (CAS) procedures from January 2005 to January 2006 for hemodynamic lesions of the carotid bifurcation (> 70% stenosis).
Material and methods: High-resolution Colour-Flow Mapping (CFM), Transcranial Doppler (TCD), cerebral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) and four psychometric tests (Mini mental state, Beck depression inventory, Zung anxiety inventory, SF-12) were carried out in the preoperative evaluation in all the patients. In the CEAs loco-regional anesthesia (100%), patch angioplasty (84%) and Pruitt-Inahara shunt (4%) were employed in the CASs local anesthesia (100%), three different carotid stents (Precise-Cordis, Acculink-Guidant and Carotid Wallstent-Boston Scientific) and three temporary distal filter protection devices (Angioguard-Cordis, Accunet-Guidant, Filterwire-EZ- Boston Scientific), without pre-dilatation, were employed.; TCD monitoring was used intra-operatively and 12 hours post-operatively to evaluate the presence and the number of microembolic events (ME's) and to investigate the efficiency of neuroprotective filter devices. The efficacy of the in situ opened filter was judged evaluating the decrease of mean blood velocity in ipsilateral middle cerebral artery and the reduction rate of microembolic events (number of microemboli detected during the entire procedurenumber of microemboli detected during the filter positioning).; Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the brain was obtained within 24 to 48 hours after the procedures to detect new ischemic brain lesions. Psychometric tests were repeated at the discharge of the patient and after two months to evaluate cognitive faculties.; Results : During postoperative period (30 days) and follow-up, no procedure-related death and three regressive minor strokes occurred: I in CEA (2%) and 2 in CASs (4%); a cranial nerve lesion occurred in CEA (2%). TCD monitoring showed ME's (a mean of five events) in 37 CEAs (74%) and in 50 CASs (100%) (a mean of 60 ME's). In five patients submitted to CAS repeated microemboli occurred during one hour postoperative TCD control (10%). A 10-30% decrease of mean blood velocity basal value was recorded in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery when the filter device was opened. A mean 70% reduction of ME's was obtained with a cerebral protection system deployed. Postoperative DWI detected new focal ischemic lesions in 24 patients 22 after CAS (44%) (a mean of 5 new ipsi and contra-lateral lesions), and 2 after CEA (4%). Cognitive capability worsened in 20 patients 18 after CAS (36%) e 2 after CEA (4%).; Conclusions : Mortality and morbidity rates of patients submitted to CAS are comparable to the results obtained by CEA. A great number of ME's are recorded by TCD during endovascular procedures, more than during open surgery. ME's due to CAS are reduced by filter protection devices, but the cognitive faculties in a great number of "asymptomatic" patients are decreased after CAS.

N2  -  The cholinergic innervation of rat cerebral cortex was studied by immunohistochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase. Stained bipolar cells, fibers and terminals were found in all areas of cortex. The density of cholinergic terminals was similar in all cortical areas with the exception of entorhinal and olfactory cortex, which showed a marked increase in the number of stained terminals. A laminar distribution of cholinergic terminals was found in many cortical areas. In motor and  most sensory areas, terminal density was high in layer 1 and upper layer 5, and lowest in layer 4. Visual cortex, in contrast to other cortical areas, was characterized by a dense band of innervation in layer 4. It has been known that the majority of cortical cholinergic structures derive from a projection to cortex from large, multipolar neurons in the basal forebrain, which stain heavily for choline acetyltransferase. In this study, stained fibers were observed to take three different pathways from basal forebrain to cortex. The first, confined to medial aspects of forebrain and cortex, was observed to originate in the septal area, from where fibers formed a discrete bundle, swinging forward around the rostral end of the corpus callosum, then traveling caudally in the cingulate bundle. The second was found to consist of fibers fanning out laterally from the area of the globus pallidus, travelling through the caudate, then continuing for various distances in the corpus callosum before finally turning into the cortex. A third pathway appeared to innervate olfactory and entorhinal cortex. Ibotenic acid injections were made in the area of the globus pallidus to study the effect of lesioning the lateral pathway on the cholinergic innervation in cortex. A major loss of choline acetyltransferase positive terminals was observed in neocortex, but retrosplenial, cingulate, entorhinal and olfactory cortex showed a normal density of cholinergic innervation. The borders  separating areas with lesioned cholinergic input from non-lesioned areas were precise. The distribution of stained terminals remaining in cortical areas with lesioned basal forebrain innervation suggests that the basal forebrain projection to cerebral cortex, and not the intrinsic cortical cholinergic neurons, give rise to the laminar distribution of cholinergic terminals observed in normal cortex. To compare the relative densities of different cholinergic cortical systems, the distribution of choline acetyltransferase staining was compared with that of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and substance P, which are co-localized in some choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons innervating cortex.

N2  -  Functional brain mapping (FBM) is an integral part of contemporary neurosurgery. It is crucial for safe and optimal resection of brain lesions like gliomas. The eloquent regions of the cortex like motor, somatosensory, Wernicke's, and Broca are usually mapped, either preoperatively or intraoperatively. Since its birth in the nineteenth century, FBM has witnessed immense modernization, radical refinements, and the introduction of novel techniques, most of which are non-invasive. Direct electrical stimulation of the cortex, despite its high invasiveness, remains the technique of choice. Non-invasive techniques like fMRI and magnetoencephalography allow us the convenience of multiple mappings with minimal discomfort to the patients. They are quick, easy to do, and allow thorough study. Different modalities are now being combined to yield better delineations like fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. This article reviews the physical principles, applications, merits, shortcomings, and latest developments of nine FBM techniques. Other than neurosurgical operations, these techniques have also been applied to studies of stroke, Alzheimer's, and cognition. There are strong indications that the future of brain mapping shall see the non-invasive techniques playing a more dominant role as they become more sensitive and accurate due to advances in physics, refined algorithms, and subsequent validation against invasive techniques.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate the role of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in image-guided mini-invasive neurosurgery.
Methods: Twenty-one patients were operated under general anaesthesia with the aid of multimodal intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring to remove supratentorials tumors closely related to the cortico-spinal tract. Pre-operative assessment included fMRI scans and tractography that were uploaded into the intraoperative neuro-navigation system. Monitoring consisted in simultaneously recording EEG, electrocorticography, transcranial and direct motor evoked potentials (tMEP and dMEP), somatosensory evoked potentials and subcortical stimulation during the whole procedures.; Results: The recording of all the electrophysiological signals was possible in all procedures. SSEP guided the positioning of the strip electrode over the motor cortex (N20 phase inversion) that was used to evoke dMEP and monitor the lower limb motor responses; subcortical stimulation to unveil the spatial relationship between the tumors and motor fibers. Four patients had transient worsening of the symptoms, but only two had a long-term worsening, although not severe, of the pre-op clinical status.; Conclusions: Intraoperative neurophysiology has a great value in mini-invasive neurosurgery, especially because the motor cortex is not exposed, consequently it cannot be directly mapped. This report describes a valuable scheme making use of as many electrophysiological signals as possible to constantly monitor the motor functions.; Significance: A useful method to monitor motor functions in mini-invasive neurosurgery was described.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Low blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) correlates with the development of postoperative cerebral ischemic lesions related to generation of microemboli during dissection of carotid arteries in carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospectively controlled trial was to determine whether increased mean blood flow velocity in the MCA by intentional hypertension during carotid dissection in CEA prevented postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli.; METHODS: Patients with ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (>70%) underwent CEA under transcranial Doppler monitoring of mean blood flow velocity and microembolic signals in the ipsilateral MCA. Attempts were made to keep systolic blood pressure during carotid dissection between -10% and +10% of the preoperative value (controls, n = 65) or above a +10% increase (intentional hypertension group, n = 65).; RESULTS: Incidence of new ischemic lesions on postoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was significantly lower in the intentional hypertension group both for all patients (controls, 15.4%; intentional hypertension group, 3.1%; P = .03) and in a subgroup of 37 patients showing microembolic signals during carotid dissection (controls, 52.6%; intentional hypertension group, 11.1%; P = .013). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated the absence of intentional hyperperfusion (95% confidence interval: 1.77-100.00; P = .012) and high number of microembolic signals (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.62; P = .05) during carotid dissection were significant independent predictors of the postoperative development of new ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.; CONCLUSION: Increased MCA mean blood flow velocity by intentional hypertension during dissection of the carotid artery in CEA prevents the postoperative development of new cerebral ischemic lesions caused by intraoperative microemboli.

N2  -  Simple Summary Understanding the complex network of high-level relationships within tumors and between surrounding tissue is challenging and not fully understood. Our findings demonstrate that the tumor connectomics framework (TCF) models different networks within the tumors and surrounding tissue that are detectable on imaging. The TCF extracts a set of graph network features for each lesion and provides insight into the different types of interactions of a cancer under investigation. These TCF networks are visualized with the radiological parameters and overlaid onto the structural images for better understanding of the global and regional connections within the lesion and surrounding tissue. This information could be used for improved cancer therapeutic targeting in neoplasms and response within different organ systems. The high-level relationships that form complex networks within tumors and between surrounding tissue is challenging and not fully understood. To better understand these tumoral networks, we developed a tumor connectomics framework (TCF) based on graph theory with machine learning to model the complex interactions within and around the tumor microenvironment that are detectable on imaging. The TCF characterization model was tested with independent datasets of breast, brain, and prostate lesions with corresponding validation datasets in breast and brain cancer. The TCF network connections were modeled using graph metrics of centrality, average path length (APL), and clustering from multiparametric MRI with IsoSVM. The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Area Under the Curve-ROC, and Precision-Recall (AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) were used for statistical analysis. The TCF classified the breast and brain tumor cohorts with an IsoSVM AUC-PR and MCC of 0.86, 0.63 and 0.85, 0.65, respectively. The TCF benign breast lesions had a significantly higher clustering coefficient and degree centrality than malignant TCFs. Grade 2 brain tumors demonstrated higher connectivity compared to Grade 4 tumors with increased degree centrality and clustering coefficients. Gleason 7 prostate lesions had increased betweenness centrality and APL compared to Gleason 6 lesions with AUC-PR and MCC ranging from 0.90 to 0.99 and 0.73 to 0.87, respectively. These TCF findings were similar in the validation breast and brain datasets. In conclusion, we present a new method for tumor characterization and visualization that results in a better understanding of the global and regional connections within the lesion and surrounding tissue.

N2  -  Understanding structure-function relationships in the brain after stroke is reliant not only on the accurate anatomical delineation of the focal ischemic lesion, but also on previous infarcts, remote changes and the presence or white matter hyperintensities. The robust definition of primary stroke boundaries and secondary brain lesion: will have significant impact on investigation of brain-behavior relationships and lesion volume correlation: with clinical measures after stroke. Here we present an automated approach to identify chronic ischemic infarctr in addition to other white matter pathologies, that may be used to aid the development of post-stroke management strategies. Our approach uses Bayesian-Markov Random Field (MRF) classification to segment probable lesion volumes present on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. Thereafter, a random forest classification of the information from multimodal (TI-weighted, 12-weighted, FLAIR, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) MRI images and other context-aware features (within the probable lesion areas) was used to extract areas with high likelihood of being classified as lesions. The final segmentation of the lesion was obtained by ffiresholding the random forest probabilistic maps. The accuracy of the automated lesion delineation method was assessed in a total of 36 patients (24 male, 12 female, mean age: 64.57 +/- 14.23 yrs) at 3 months after stroke onset and compared with manually segmented lesion volumes by an expert Accuracy assessment of the automated lesion identification method was performed using the commonly used evaluation metrics. The mean sensitivity of segmentation was measured to be 0.53 +/- 0.13 with a mean positive predictive value of 0.75 +/- 0.18. The mean lesion volume difference was observed to be 3232% 21.643% with a high Pearson's correlation o r = 0.76 (p < 0.0001). The lesion overlap accuracy was measured in terms of Dice similarity coefficient with mean of 0.60 +/- 0.12, while the contour accuracy was observed with a mean surface distance of 3.06 mm 3.17 mm. The results signify that our method was successful in identifying most of the lesion areas in FLAIR with a low false positive rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

N2  -  An MR image-based computational model of a murine KHT sarcoma is presented that allows the calculation of plasma fluid and solute transport within tissue. Such image-based models of solid tumors may be used to optimize patient-specific therapies. This model incorporates heterogeneous vasculature and tissue porosity to account for nonuniform perfusion of an MR-visible tracer, gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was conducted following intravenous infusion of Gd-DTPA to provide 1 h of tracer-concentration distribution data within tissue. Early time points (19 min) were used to construct 3D K (trans) and porosity maps using a two-compartment model; tracer transport was predicted at later time points using a 3D porous media model. Model development involved selecting an arterial input function (AIF) and conducting a sensitivity analysis of model parameters (tissue, vascular, and initial estimation of solute concentration in plasma) to investigate the effects on transport for a specific tumor. The developed model was then used to predict transport in two additional tumors. The sensitivity analysis suggests that plasma fluid transport is more sensitive to parameter changes than solute transport due to the dominance of transvascular exchange. Gd-DTPA distribution was similar to experimental patterns, but differences in Gd-DTPA magnitude at later time points may result from inaccurate selection of AIF. Thus, accurate AIF estimation is important for later time point prediction of low molecular weight tracer or drug transport in smaller tumors.

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: A histologic grade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is clinically important because of its association with prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of histographic analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume in differentiating histologic grades in HNSCC at standard (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) and high (b = 2000 s/mm(2)) b values.
Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients with HNSCC, including well-differentiated (WD; n = 35), moderately differentiated (MD; n = 13) and poorly differentiated (PD; n = 6) carcinomas, were retrospectively evaluated. ADC maps were obtained at two different b values (1000 and 2000 smm(2)) in each patient. Tumors were delineated on each slice of ADC maps, and data were collected to obtain a histogram for the entire tumor volume. Histographic parameters were calculated, including mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and the ratio of the kurtosis measured at b values of 1000 and 2000 smm(2). These parameters were correlated with histologic grades.; Results: There was no significant correlation between tumor grades and histographic parameters obtained from ADC maps at b = 1000 smm(2). However, mean ADC at b = 2000 smm(2) was significantly higher in WD HNSCC (881 +- 131 x 10(-6) mm(2)s) than in MD and PD HNSCC (770 +- 163 and 780 +- 158 x 10(-6) mm(2)s, respectively) (P < .05). Kurtosis ratio was significantly higher in PD HNSCC (115 +- 10%) compared to WD and MD HNSCC (91 +- 21% and 86 +- 26%, respectively) (P < .05). Diagnostic accuracy was 100%, 76.9%, and 65.8% for PD, MD, and WD HNSCC, respectively.; Conclusions: Histographic analysis of ADC maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume can be useful in differentiating histologic grades of HNSCC using mean ADC at b = 2000 smm(2) and kurtosis ratio.

N2  -  The biggest challenge in neuro-oncology is the treatment of glioblastoma, which exhibits poor prognosis and is increasing in incidence in an increasing aging population. Diverse treatment strategies aim at maximum cytoreduction and ensuring good quality of life. We discuss multimodal neuronavigation, supra-maximum tumor resection, and the postoperative treatment gap. Multimodal neuronavigation allows the integration of preoperative anatomic and functional data with intraoperative information. This approach includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging in preplanning and ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), MRI and direct (sub) cortical stimulation during surgery. The practice of awake craniotomy decreases postoperative neurologic deficits, and an extensive supra-maximum resection appears to be feasible, even in eloquent areas of the brain. Intraoperative MRI- and fluorescence-guided surgery assist in achieving this goal of supra-maximum resection and have been the subject of an increasing number of reports. Photodynamic therapy and local chemotherapy are properly positioned to bridge the gap between surgery and chemoradiotherapy. The photosensitizer used in fluorescence-guided surgery persists in the remaining peripheral tumor extensions. Additionally, blinded randomized clinical trials showed firm evidence of extra cytoreduction by local chemotherapy in the tumor cavity. The cutting-edge promise is gene therapy although both the delivery and efficacy of the numerous transgenes remain under investigation. Issues such as the choice of (cell) vector, the choice of therapeutic transgene, the optimal route of administration, and biosafety need to be addressed in a systematic way. In this selective review, we present various evidence and promises to improve survival of glioblastoma patients by supra-maximum cytoreduction via local procedures while minimizing the risk of new neurologic deficit.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
Diffusion MR imaging sequences essential for clinical neuroradiology imaging protocols may be accelerated with simultaneous multislice acquisitions. We tested whether simultaneous multislice?accelerated diffusion data were clinically equivalent to standard acquisitions.; MATERIALS AND METHODS:; In this retrospective study, clinical diffusion sequences obtained before and after implementation of 2-slice simultaneous multislice acceleration and an altered diffusion gradient sampling scheme using the same 3T MRI scanner and 20-channel coil (n = 25 per group) were independently and blindly evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists for perceived quality, artifacts, and overall diagnostic utility. Diffusion tractography was performed in 13 patients both with and without 2-slice simultaneous multislice acceleration (b = 0, 1000, 2000 smm(2); 60 directions). The corticospinal tract and arcuate fasciculus ipsilateral to the lesion were generated using the same ROIs and then blindly assessed by a neurosurgeon for anatomic fidelity, perceived quality, and impact on surgical management. Tract volumes were compared for spatial overlap.; RESULTS:; Two-slice simultaneous multislice diffusion reduced acquisition times from 141 to 45 seconds for routine diffusion and from 7.5 to 5.9 minutes for diffusion tractography using 3T MR imaging. The simultaneous multislice?accelerated diffusion sequence was rated equivalent for diagnostic utility despite reductions to perceived image quality. Simultaneous multislice?accelerated diffusion tractography was rated clinically equivalent. Dice similarity coefficients between routine and simultaneous multislice?generated corticospinal tract and arcuate fasciculus tract volumes were 0.78 (SD, 0.03) and 0.71 (SD, 0.05), respectively.; CONCLUSIONS:; Two-slice simultaneous multislice diffusion appeared clinically equivalent for standard acquisitions and diffusion tractography. Simultaneous multislice makes it feasible to acquire higher angular and q-space-resolution diffusion acquisitions required for translating advanced diffusion models into clinical practice.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is significant interest in whether diffusion-weighted MR imaging indices, such as the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient, may be useful clinically for preoperative tumor grading and treatment planning. To help establish the pathologic correlate of minimum ADC, we undertook a study investigating the relationship between minimum ADC and maximum FDOPA PET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging and FDOPA PET data were acquired preoperatively from 15 patients who were subsequently diagnosed with high-grade brain tumor (WHO grade III or IV) by histopathologic analysis. ADC and SUVR normalized FDOPA PET maps were registered to the corresponding CE MR imaging. Regions of minimum ADC within the FDOPA-defined tumor volume were anatomically correlated with areas of maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake.; RESULTS: Minimal anatomic overlap was found between regions exhibiting minimum ADC (a putative marker of tumor cellularity) and maximum FDOPA SUVR uptake (a marker of tumor infiltration and proliferation). FDOPA SUVR measures for tumoral regions exhibiting minimum ADC (1.36 +- 0.22) were significantly reduced compared with those with maximum FDOPA uptake (2.45 +- 0.88, P = .0001).; CONCLUSIONS: There was a poor correlation between minimum ADC and the most viableaggressive component of high-grade gliomas. This study suggests that other factors, such as tissue compression and ischemia, may be contributing to restricted diffusion in GBM. Caution should be exercised in the clinical use of minimum ADC as a marker of tumor grade and the use of this index for guiding tumor biopsies preoperatively.

N2  -  Aphasia can occur in a broad range of pathological conditions that affect cortical or subcortical structures. Here we test the hypothesis that white matter integrity of language pathways assessed by preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is associated with language performance and its recovery after glioma resection. 27 patients with preoperative DTI were included. Segmentation of the arcuate fascicle (AF), the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fascicle (ILF), the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), and the uncinate fascicle (UF) was performed with a fully-connected neural network (FCNN, TractSeg). Median fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from the resulting volumes as surrogate marker for white matter integrity and tested for corre-lation with clinical parameters. After correction for demographic data and multiple testing, preoperative white matter integrity of the IFOF, the ILF, and the UF in the left hemisphere were independently and significantly associated with aphasia three months after surgery. Comparison between patients with and without aphasia three months after surgery revealed significant differences in preoperative white matter integrity of the left AF (p = 0.021), left IFOF (p = 0.015), left ILF (p = 0.003), left SLF (p = 0.001, p = 0.021, p = 0.043 for respective sub-bundles 1-3), left UF (p = 0.041) and the right AF (p = 0.027). Preoperative assessment of white matter integrity of the language network by time-efficient MRI protocols and FCNN-driven segmentation may assist in the evaluation of postoperative rehabilitation potential in glioma patients.

N2  -  Objective. The aims of this study were: 1) To develop protocols for, integration and assessment of the usefulness of high quality fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) data in an ultrasound-based neuronavigation system. 2) To develop and demonstrate a co-registration method for automatic brain-shift correction of pre-operative MR data using intra-operative 3D ultrasound.
Methods. Twelve patients undergoing brain surgery were scanned to obtain structural and fMRI data before the operation. In six of these patients, DTI data was also obtained. The preoperative data was imported into a commercial ultrasound-based navigation system and used for surgical planning and guidance. Intra-operative ultrasound volumes were acquired when needed during surgery and the multimodal data was used for guidance and resection control. The use of the available image information during planning and surgery was recorded. An automatic voxel-based registration method between preoperative MRA and intra-operative 3D ultrasound angiography (Power Doppler) was developed and tested postoperatively.; Results. The study showed that it is possible to implement robust, high-quality protocols for fMRI and DTI and that the acquired data could be seamlessly integrated in an ultrasound-based neuronavigation system. Navigation based on fMRI data was found to be important for pre-operative planning in all twelve procedures. In five out of eleven cases the data was also found useful during the resection. DTI data was found to be useful for planning in all five cases where these data were imported into the navigation system. In two out of four cases DTI data was also considered important during the resection (in one case DTI data were acquired but not imported and in another case fMRI and DTI data could only be used for planning). Information regarding the location of important functional areas (fMRI) was more beneficial during the planning phase while DTI data was more helpful during the resection. Furthermore, the surgeon found it more user-friendly and efficient to interpret fMRI and DTI information when shown in a navigation system as compared to the traditional display on a light board or monitor. Updating MRI data for brain-shift using automatic co-registration of preoperative MRI with intra-operative ultrasound was feasible.; Conclusion. In the present study we have demonstrated how both fMRI and DTI data can be acquired and integrated into a neuronavigation system for improved surgical planning and guidance. The surgeons reported that the integration of fMRI and DTI data in the navigation system represented valuable additional information presented in a user-friendly way and functional neuronavigation is now in routine use at our hospital. Furthermore, the present study showed that automatic ultrasound-based updates of important pre-operative MRI data are feasible and hence can be used to compensate for brain shift.

N2  -  Acute encephalopathy is a disease group more commonly seen in children. It is often severe and has neurological sequelae. Imaging is important for early diagnosis and prompt treatment to ameliorate an unfavorable outcome, but insufficient sensitivity/specificity is a problem. To overcome this, a new value (fraction of high b-pair (F-H)) that could be processed from clinically acceptable MR diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with three different b-values was designed on the basis of a two-compartment model of water diffusion signal attenuation. The purpose of this study is to compare F-H with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) regarding the detectability of pediatric acute encephalopathy. We retrospectively compared the clinical DWI of 15 children (1-10 years old, mean 2.34, 8 boys, 7 girls) of acute encephalopathy with another 16 children (1-11 years old, mean 4.89, 9 boys, 7 girls) as control. A comparison was first made visually by mapping F-H on the brain images, and then a second comparison was made on the basis of 10 regions of interest (ROIs) set on cortical and subcortical areas of each child. F-H map visually revealed diffusely elevated F-H in cortical and subcortical areas of the patients with acute encephalopathy; the changes seemed more diffuse in F-H compared to DWI. The comparison based on ROI revealed elevated mean F-H in the cortical and subcortical areas of the acute encephalopathy patients compared to control with significant difference (P<0.05). Similar findings were observed even in regions where the findings of DWI were slight. The reduction of mean ADC was significant in regions with severe findings in DWI, but it was not constant in the areas with slighter DWI findings. The detectability of slight changes of cortical and subcortical lesions in acute encephalopathy may be superior in F-H compared to ADC.

N2  -  Neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions are a major public health concern for which new therapies are urgently needed. The development of effective therapies relies on the precise mapping of the neural substrates causally involved in behaviour generation. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) performed during cognitive and neurological monitoring in awake surgery is currently considered the gold standard for the causal mapping of brain functions. However, DES is limited by the focal nature of the stimulation sites, hampering a real holistic exploration of human brain functions at the network level.We used 4137 DES points derived from 612 glioma patients in combination with human connectome data-resting-state functional MRI, n = 1000 and diffusion weighted imaging, n = 284-to provide a multimodal description of the causal macroscale functional networks subtending 12 distinct behavioural domains. To probe the validity of our procedure, we (i) compared the network topographies of healthy and clinical populations; (ii) tested the predictive capacity of DES-derived networks; (iii) quantified the coupling between structural and functional connectivity; and (iv) built a multivariate model able to quantify single subject deviations from a normative population. Lastly, we probed the translational potential of DES-derived functional networks by testing their specificity and sensitivity in identifying critical neuromodulation targets and neural substrates associated with postoperative language deficits.The combination of DES and human connectome data resulted in an average 29.4-fold increase in whole brain coverage compared to DES alone. DES-derived functional networks are predictive of future stimulation points (97.8% accuracy) and strongly supported by the anatomical connectivity of subcortical stimulations. We did not observe any significant topographical differences between the patients and the healthy population at both group and single subject level. Showcasing concrete clinical applications, we found that DES-derived functional networks overlap with effective neuromodulation targets across several functional domains, show a high degree of specificity when tested with the intracranial stimulation points of a different stimulation technique and can be used effectively to characterize postoperative behavioural deficits.The integration of DES with the human connectome fundamentally advances the quality of the functional mapping provided by DES or functional imaging alone. DES-derived functional networks can reliably predict future stimulation points, have a strong correspondence with the underlying white matter and can be used for patient specific functional mapping. Possible applications range from psychiatry and neurology to neuropsychology, neurosurgery and neurorehabilitation.
Coletta et al. integrate direct electrical stimulation performed during cognitive and neurological monitoring in awake surgery with human connectome data, opening a unique window into the intrinsic organization of the human brain and providing an unprecedented holistic exploration of brain functions.

N2  -  Detailed information regarding the neuroanatomy of reciprocal cerebrocerebellar pathways is based on well-documented animal models. This knowledge has not yet been fully translated to humans, in that the structure of reciprocal cerebrocerebellar pathways connecting the cerebellum with frontal lobe has not been shown in its entirety. We investigated the impact of injury and age on cerebrocerebellar pathway microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography. We used medulloblastoma (MB) as an injury model due to the known impact of tumor/treatment on the cerebellum, one of the main nodes of cerebrocerebellar pathways. We delineated and segmented reciprocal cerebrocerebellar pathways connecting the cerebellum with frontal lobe in 38 healthy children (HC) and 34 children treated for MB, and compared pathway segment DTI measures between HC and MB and across three age cohorts: childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence. Pathway compromise was evident for the MB group compared to HC, particularly within posterior segments (Ps<0.01). Though we found no age effect, group differences in microstructure were driven by pathway segment (posterior) and age cohort (adolescence), which may reflect the extent of injury to the posterior fossa following treatment for MB and age cohort differences in radiation treatment protocol in our sample. We have examined the microstructure of reciprocal cerebrocerebellar connections in the pediatric brain and have found that these pathways are injured in MB, a clinical population treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Our findings support the late effects literature describing white matter injury emergence in the years following treatment for MB. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2615-2628, 2015.

N2  -  Background: Depression is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the biological background underlying such association is poorly understood. Objective: Investigating the functional connections of neurotransmitter-related brainstem nuclei, along with their relationship with white matter (WM) microstructure, in MS patients with depressive symptomatology (MS-D) and without depressive symptomatology (MS-nD). Methods: Combined resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) study on 50 MS patients, including 19 MS-D and 31 MS-nD patients, along with 37 healthy controls (HC). Main analyses performed are (1) comparison between groups of raphe nuclei (RN)-related functional connectivity (FC); (2) correlation between RN-related FC and whole brain dMRI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) map; and (3) comparison between groups of FA in the RN-related WM area. Results: (1) RN-related FC was reduced in MS-D when compared to MS-nD and HC; (2) RN-related FC positively correlated with FA in a WM cluster mainly encompassing thalamic/basal ganglia regions, including the fornix; and (3) FA in such WM area was reduced in MS-D. Conclusion: Depressive symptomatology in MS is specifically associated to a functional disconnection of neurotransmitter-related nuclei, which in turn may be traced to a distinct spatial pattern of WM alterations mainly involving the limbic network.

N2  -  Brain cancers pose a novel set of difficulties due to the limited accessibility of human brain tumor tissue. For this reason, clinical decision-making relies heavily on MR imaging interpretation, yet the mapping between MRI features and underlying biology remains ambiguous. Standard (clinical) tissue sampling fails to capture the full heterogeneity of the disease. Biopsies are required to obtain a pathological diagnosis and are predominantly taken from the tumor core, which often has different traits to the surrounding invasive tumor that typically leads to recurrent disease. One approach to solving this issue is to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of molecular, genetic, and cellular features of glioma through the intraoperative collection of multiple image-localized biopsy samples paired with multi-parametric MRIs. We have adopted this approach and are currently actively enrolling patients for our 'Image-Based Mapping of Brain Tumors' study. Patients are eligible for this research study (IRB #16-002424) if they are 18 years or older and undergoing surgical intervention for a brain lesion. Once identified, candidate patients receive dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in addition to standard sequences (T1, T1Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR) at their presurgical scan. During surgery, sample anatomical locations are tracked using neuronavigation. The collected specimens from this research study are used to capture the intra-tumoral heterogeneity across brain tumors including quantification of genetic aberrations through whole-exome and RNA sequencing as well as other tissue analysis techniques. To date, these data (made available through a public portal) have been used to generate, test, and validate predictive regional maps of the spatial distribution of tumor cell density and/or treatment-related key genetic marker status to identify biopsy and/or treatment targets based on insight from the entire tumor makeup. This type of methodology, when delivered within clinically feasible time frames, has the potential to further inform medical decision-making by improving surgical intervention, radiation, and targeted drug therapy for patients with glioma.

N2  -  Applications of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging outside the brain have gained increasing importance in recent years. Owing to technical improvements in MR imaging units and faster sequences, the need for noninvasive imaging without contrast medium administration, mainly in patients with renal insufficiency, can be met successfully by applying this technique. DW MR imaging is quantified by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which provides information on diffusion and perfusion simultaneously. By using a biexponential fitting process of the DW MR imaging data, these two entities can be separated, because this type of fitting process can serve as an estimate of both the perfusion fraction and the true diffusion coefficient. DW MR imaging can be applied for functional evaluation of the kidneys in patients with acute or chronic renal failure. Impairment of renal function is accompanied by a decreased ADC. Acute ureteral obstruction leads to perfusion and diffusion changes in the affected kidney, and renal artery stenosis results in a decreased ADC. In patients with pyelonephritis, diffuse or focal changes in signal intensity are seen on the high-b-value images, with increased signal intensity corresponding to low signal intensity on the ADC map. The feasibility and reproducibility of DW MR imaging in patients with transplanted kidneys have already been demonstrated, and initial results seem to be promising for the assessment of allograft deterioration. Overall, performance of renal DW MR imaging, presuming that measurements are of high quality, will further boost this modality, particularly for early detection of diffuse renal conditions, as well as more accurate characterization of focal renal lesions.

N2  -  Vessel size imaging (VSI) for brain tumor characterization was evaluated and the vessel size index measured by MRI (VSIMRI) was correlated with VSI obtained by histology (VSIhisto). Blood volume (BV) and VSI maps were obtained on 12 rats by simultaneous measurements of R-2* and R-2, before and after the injection of a macromolecular contrast agent, AMI-227. Immunostaining of collagen IV in vessels was performed. An expression was derived for evaluating VSI from stereologic measurements on histology data (VSIhisto). On BV and VSI images obtained from large-size tumors (n = 9), three regions could be distinguished and correlated well with histological sections: a high BV region surrounding the tumor, a necrotic area where BV is very low, and a viable tumor tissue region showing lower BV but higher VSI than the normal rat cortex, with the presence of larger vessels. The quantitative analysis showed a good correlation (Spearman rank's rho = 0.74) between VSIhisto and VSIMRI with a linear regression coefficient of 1.17. The good correlation coefficient supports VSI imaging as a quantitative method for tumor vasculature characterization. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Background: The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of hemichorea-hemiballismus (HCHB) associated with hyperglycemia are characterized by hyperintensities in the striatum on T1-weighted MR images and computed tomographic scans, with a mechanism of petechial hemorrhage considered to be responsible. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has been reported to detect early ischemic damage (cytotoxic edema) as bright areas of high signal intensity and vasogenic edema as areas of heterogeneous signal intensity. We report various DWI findings in 2 patients with hyperglycemia HCHB.
Objectives: To describe the DWI and gradient echo findings and characterize the types of edema in HCHB associated with hyperglycemia.; Setting: A tertiary referral center neurology department.; Design and Methods: Two patients with HCHB associated with hyperglycemia underwent DWI, gradient echo imaging, and conventional MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement. The patients had an elevated serum glucose level on admission and a long history of uncontrolled diabetes, and the symptoms were controlled by dopamine receptor blocking agents. Initial DWIs were obtained 5 to 20 days after symptom onset. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the abnormal lesions with visual inspection of DWI and T2-weighted echo planar images.; Results: T1- and T2-weighted MR images and brain computed tomographic scans showed high signal intensities in the right head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Gradient echo images were normal. The DWIs showed bright high signal intensity in the corresponding lesions (patient 1), and the ADC values were decreased. The decrease in ADC and the high signal intensity on DWI persisted despite the disappearance of HCHB, even after 70 days.; Conclusions: Gradient echo MR imaging findings were normal in HCHB with hyperglycemia, whereas DWI and the ADC map showed restricted diffusion, which suggests that hyperviscosity, not petechial hemorrhage, with cytotoxic edema can cause the observed MR abnormalities.

N2  -  The distribution of the immunoreactivity to nitric oxide synthase has been examined from rostral to caudal areas of the rat central nervous system using light microscopy. Endogenous nitric oxide synthase was located using a specific polyclonal antiserum, produced against affinity purified nitric oxide synthase from whole rat brain, following the avidin-biotin peroxidase procedure. Immunoreactive cell bodies and processes showed a widespread distribution in the brain. In the telencephalon, immunoreactive structures were distributed in all areas of the cerebral cortex, the ventral endopiriform nucleus and claustrum, the main and accessory olfactory bulb, the anterior and posterior olfactory nuclei, the precommisural hippocampus, the taenia tecta, the nucleus accumbens, the stria terminalis, the caudate putamen, the olfactory tubercle and islands of Calleja, septum, globus pallidus and substantia innominata, hippocampus and amygdala. In the diencephalon, the immunoreactivity was largely found in both the hypothalamus and thalamus. In the hypothalamus, immunoreactive cell bodies were characteristically located in the perivascular-neurosecretory systems and mamillary bodies. In addition, immunoreactive nerve fibres were detected in the median eminence of the infundibular stem. The mesencephalon showed nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity in the ventral tegmental area, the interpeduncular nucleus, the rostral linear nucleus of the raphe and the dorsal raphe nucleus. Immunoreactive structures were also found in the nuclei of the central grey, the peripeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars lateralis, the geniculate nucleus and in the superior and inferior colliculi.
The pens displayed immunoreactive structures principally in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, the ventral tegmental nucleus, the reticulotegmental pontine nucleus, the parabrachial nucleus and locus coeruleus. In the medulla oblongata, immunoreactive neurons and processes were detected in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, the trapezoid body, the raphe magnus, the pontine reticular nuclei, the supragenual nucleus, the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei, the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the medullary reticular field, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the gracile and cuneate nuclei, the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the oral, interpolar and caudal parts of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In the cerebellum, the stellate and basket cells showed immunoreactivity, which was also seen in the basket terminal fibres of the Purkinje cell layer. Isolated immunoreactive Purkinje cells were found in the vermis and parafloccular regions of the cerebellum. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, the granular cells and glomeruli were also immunoreactive. Numerous positive varicose nerve fibres and occasional neurons were also found in the lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei. Immunoreactive processes were found close to and penetrating the ependymal cells of the ventricular walls, particularly the lateral ventricles. Immunoreactive cell bodies were also detected in the circumventricular organs, including the subfornical organ and area postrema. Cerebral blood vessels were largely surrounded by varicose immunoreactive neuronal processes forming dense networks. Our demonstration of the widespread distribution of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in diverse nuclei of the rat brain generally confirms earlier histochemical studies and suggests that this enzyme may affect the function of various neurotransmitter-specific systems. The possible implication of nitric oxide synthase in the regulation of the cerebrospinal fluid system and of cerebral blood circulation is discussed.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine which MR technique was the most sensitive to age-related white matter damage. We compared both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer (MT) maps to determine which technique correlated most strongly with cognitive function in a middle-aged and elderly community population.
Materials and Methods: In all, 64 healthy subjects (aged 50-90) underwent MR and neuropsychology. Histograms were generated for white matter mean diffusivity (MID), fractional anisotropy (FA), and MT ratio (MTR). White matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) and brain volume were also determined. Composite neuropsychological scores were derived for 4 cognitive domains (executive function, working memory, episodic memory, and information processing speed).; Results: All MR parameters correlated with age (FA r = 0.726. P < 0.001: MD r = -0.619 P < 0.00 1, MTR r = -0.566, P < 0.001, WMH r = 0.511, P < 0.001). All MRI parameters correlated with cognition, but EM, and particularly FA, correlated most strongly. Adding EM parameters explained more variance in cognition than WMH alone; the increase was greatest with FA, which alone explained 45%, 33%, and 25% of the variance in cognition for information processing speed, episodic memory, and executive function, respectively.; Conclusion: EM appears the most sensitive imaging parameter to determine age-related white matter damage. The stronger relationship with FA suggests that axonal damage is important in age-related cognitive decline.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging with split acquisition of fast spin-echo signals (SPLICE) in the tissue characterization of head and neck mass lesions.
Patients and methods: DW MR. images of 67 head and neck mass lesions were obtained using SPLICE with b-factors of 0 and 771 smm(2) The lesions were classified into three categories: 16 cysts, 32 benign tumors, and 19 malignant tumors. After ADC maps were constructed for all lesions, ADC values were calculated and compared among the three categories.; Results: No case showed severe image distortion on DW MR imaging with SPLICE, and reliable ADC maps and ADC values were obtained in all cases. The mean ADC value of cysts was 2.41 +- 0.48 x 10(-3) mm(2)s, which was significantly higher than that of benign (1.48 +- 0.62 x 10(-1) mm(2)s) and malignant (1.23 +- 0.45 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) tumors (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the ADC values of benign and malignant tumors (P=0.246). When an ADC value of 2.10 x 10(-3) mm(2)s or higher was used as the diagnostic criterion for cysts, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 94%, 88%, and 90%, respectively.; Conclusion: SPLICE was considered a recommended DW MR imaging technique for the head and neck. Although ADC values were useful in differentiating cysts from tumors, they contributed little in predicting malignancy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose Diffuse lower grade gliomas (LGG) with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutations (IDHMUT) have a distinct survival advantage compared with IDH wild-type (IDHWT) cases but the mechanism underlying this disparity is not well understood. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has identified infiltrated non-enhancing tumor regions that are characterized by low isotropic (p) and high anisotropic (q) diffusion tensor components that associate with poor survival in glioblastoma. We hypothesized that similar regions are more prevalent in IDHWT (vs. IDHMUT) LGG. Methods p and q maps were reconstructed from preoperative DTI scans in N = 41 LGG patients with known IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status. Enhancing and non-enhancing tumor volumes were autosegmented from standard (non-DTI) MRI scans. Percentage non-enhancing tumor volumes exhibiting low p and high q (V-inf) were then determined using threshold values (p = 2 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s, q = 3 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s) and compared between IDHWT and IDHMUT LGG, and between IDHMUT LGG with and without 1p/19q codeletion. Results V-inf volumes were significantly larger in IDHWT LGG than in IDHMUT LGG (35.4 +/- 18.3% vs. 15.9 +/- 7.6%, P < 0.001). V-inf volumes did not significantly differ between IDHMUT LGG with and without 1p/19q codeletion (17.1 +/- 9.5% vs. 14.8 +/- 5.8%, P = 1.0). Conclusion IDHWT LGG exhibited larger volumes with suppressed isotropic diffusion (p) and high anisotropic diffusion (q) which reflects regions with increased cell density but non-disrupted neuronal structures. This may indicate a greater prevalence of infiltrative tumor in IDHWT LGG.

N2  -  Objective
To investigate and compare occult damages in aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-rich periependymal regions in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) vs healthy controls (HCs) and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) applying quantitative T1 mapping at 7 Tesla (T) in a cross-sectional study.; Methods; Eleven patients with NMOSD (median Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS score 3.5, disease duration 9.3 years, age 43.7 years, and 11 female) seropositive for anti-AQP4 antibodies, 7 patients with MS (median EDSS score 1.5, disease duration 3.6, age 30.2 years, and 4 female), and 10 HCs underwent 7T MRI. The imaging protocol included T2*-weighted (w) imaging and an MP2RAGE sequence yielding 3D T1w images and quantitative T1 maps. We semiautomatically marked the lesion-free periependymal area around the cerebral aqueduct and the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles to finally measure and compare the T1 relaxation time within these areas.; Results; We did not observe any differences in the T1 relaxation time between patients with NMOSD and HCs (all p > 0.05). Contrarily, the T1 relaxation time was longer in patients with MS vs patients with NMOSD (lateral ventricle p = 0.056, third ventricle p = 0.173, fourth ventricle p = 0.016, and cerebral aqueduct p = 0.048) and vs HCs (third ventricle p = 0.027, fourth ventricle p = 0.013, lateral ventricle p = 0.043, and cerebral aqueduct p = 0.005).; Conclusion; Unlike in MS, we did not observe subtle T1 changes in lesion-free periependymal regions in NMOSD, which supports the hypothesis of a rather focal than diffuse brain pathology in NMOSD.

N2  -  Neuropsychological data about acquired impairments in reading and writing provide a strong basis for the theoretical framework of the dual-route models. The present study explored the functional neuroanatomy of the reading and spelling processing system. We describe the reading and writing performance of patient CF, an Italian native speaker who developed an extremely selective reading and spelling deficit (his spontaneous speech, oral comprehension, repetition and oral picture naming were almost unimpaired) in processing double letters associated with surface dyslexia and dysgraphia, following a tumor in the left temporal lobe. In particular, the majority of CF's errors in spelling were phonologically plausible substitutions, errors concerning letter numerosity of consonants, and syllabic phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (PGC) errors. A similar pattern of impairment also emerged in his reading behavior, with a majority of lexical stress errors (the only possible type of surface reading errors in the Italian language, due the extreme regularity of print-to-sound correspondence).
CF's neuropsychological profile was combined with structural neuroimaging data, fiber tracking, and functional maps and compared to that of healthy control participants. We related CF's deficit to a dissociation between impaired ventrallexical route (as evidenced by a fractional anisotropy FA decrease along the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus IFOF) and relatively preserved dorsalphonological route (as evidenced by a rather full integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus - SLF). In terms of functional processing, the lexical-semantic ventral route network was more activated in controls than in CF, while the network supporting the dorsal route was shared by CF and the control participants. Our results are discussed within the theoretical framework of dual-route models of reading and spelling, emphasize the importance of the IFOF both in lexical reading and spelling, and offer a better comprehension of the neurological and functional substrates involved in written language and, in particular, in surface dyslexia and dysgraphia and in doublingde-doubling consonant sounds and letters.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: We studied the evolution over time of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume and the factors involved on early and late infarct growth (EIG and LIG) in stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment (EVT) according to the final revascularization grade.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of patients with anterior large artery occlusion undergoing EVT arriving at 1 comprehensive stroke center. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on arrival (pre-EVT), <2 hours after EVT (post-EVT), and on day 5. DWI lesions and perfusion maps were evaluated. Arterial revascularization was assessed according to the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grades. We recorded National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at arrival and at day 7. EIG was defined as (DWI volume post-EVT-DWI volume pre-EVT), and LIG was defined as (DWI volume at 5d-DWI volume post-EVT). Factors involved in EIG and LIG were tested via multivariable lineal models.; RESULTS: We included 98 patients (mean age 70, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17, final mTICI >= 2b 86%). Median EIG and LIG were 48 and 63.3 mL in patients with final mTICI<2b, and 3.6 and 3.9 cc in patients with final mTICI >= 2b. Both EIG and LIG were associated with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at day 7 (rho=0.667; P<0.01 and rho=0.614; P<0.01, respectively). In patients with final mTICI >= 2b, each 10% increase in the volume of DWI pre-EVT and each extra pass leaded to growths of 9% (95% CI, 7%-10%) and 14% (95% CI, 2%-28%) in the DWI volume post-EVT, respectively. Furthermore, each 10% increase in the volume of DWI post-EVT, each extra pass, and each 10 mL increase in TMax6s post-EVT were associated with growths of 8% (95% CI, 6%-9%), 9% (95% CI, 0%-19%), and 12% (95% CI, 5%-20%) in the volume of DWI post-EVT, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Infarct grows during and after EVT, especially in nonrecanalizers but also to a lesser extent in recanalizers. In recanalizers, number of passes and DWI volume influence EIG, while number of passes, DWI, and hypoperfused volume after the procedure determine LIG.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE In WHO grade II low-grade gliomas (LGGs), early postoperative MRI (epMRI) may overestimate residual tumor on FLAIR sequences. Consequently, MRI at 3-6 months follow-up (fuMRI) is used for delineation of residual tumor. This study sought to evaluate if integration of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps permits an accurate estimation of residual tumor early on epMRI.
METHODS From a consecutive cohort, 43 cases with an initial surgery for an LGG, and complete epMRI (< 72 hours after resection) and fuMRI including ADC maps, were retrospectively identified. Residual FLAIR hyperintense tumor was manually segmented on epMRI and corresponding ADC maps were coregistered. Using an expectation maximization algorithm, residual tumor segments were probabilistically clustered into areas of residual tumor, ischemia, or normal white matter (NWM) by fitting a mixture model of superimposed Gaussian curves to the ADC histogram. Tumor volumes from epMRI, clustering, and fuMRI were statistically compared and agreement analysis was performed.; RESULTS Mean FLAIR hyperintensity suggesting residual tumor was significantly larger on epMRI compared to fuMRI (19.4 +- 16.5 ml vs 8.4 +- 10.2 ml, p < 0.0001). Probabilistic clustering of corresponding ADC histograms on epMRI identified subsegments that were interpreted as mean residual tumor (7.6 +- 10.2 ml), ischemia (8.1 +- 5.9 ml), and NWM (3.7 +- 4.9 ml). Therefore, mean tumor quantification error between epMRI and fuMRI was significantly reduced (11.0 +- 10.6 ml vs-0.8 +- 3.7 ml, p < 0.0001). Mean clustered tumor volumes on epMRI were no longer significantly different from the fuMRI reference (7.6 +- 10.2 ml vs 8.4 +- 10.2 ml, p = 0.16). Correlation (Pearson r = 0.96, p < 0.0001), concordance correlation coefficient (0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.83), and Bland-Altman analysis suggested strong agreement between both measures after clustering.; CONCLUSIONS Probabilistic segmentation of ADC maps facilitates accurate assessment of residual tumor within 72 hours after LGG resection. Multiparametric image analysis detected FLAIR signal alterations attributable to surgical trauma, which led to overestimation of residual LGG on epMRI compared to fuMRI. The prognostic value and clinical impact of this method has to be evaluated in larger case series in the future.

N2  -  A traditional method of localizing brain functions has been to identify shared areas of brain damage in individuals who have a particular deficit. The rationale of this 'lesion overlap' approach is straightforward: if the individuals can no longer perform the function, the area of brain damaged in most of these individuals must have been responsible for that function. However, the reciprocal association, i.e. the probability of the lesion causing the deficit, is often not evaluated. In this study, we illustrate potential weaknesses of this approach, by re-examining regions of the brain essential for orchestrating speech articulation. A particularly elegant and widely cited lesion overlap study identified the superior part of the precentral gyrus of the insula (in the anterior insula) as the shared area of damage in chronic stroke patients with 'apraxia of speech', a disorder of motor planning and programming of speech. Others have confirmed that patients with apraxia of speech commonly have damage to the anterior insula. However, this reliable association might reflect the vulnerability of the insula to damage following occlusion or narrowing of the middle cerebral artery (which can independently cause apraxia of speech and many other deficits). To evaluate this possibility, we examined the relationship between apraxia of speech and the insula in three unique ways: (i) we determined the probability of the lesion causing the deficit, as well as the deficit being associated with the lesion, by examining speech articulation and advanced MRIs in two consecutive series of patients with acute left hemisphere, non-lacunar stroke, 40 with and 40 without insular damage; (ii) we studied patients at stroke onset to identify the deficit before it resolved in cases of small stroke; and (iii) we identified regions of dysfunctional brain tissue, as well as structural damage. Using this approach, we found no association between apraxia of speech and lesions of the left insula, anterior insula or superior tip of the precentral gyrus of the insula. Instead, in patients with and without insular lesions, apraxia of speech was associated with structural damage or low blood flow in left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. These results illustrate a potential limitation of lesion overlap studies, and illustrate an alternative method for identifying brain-behaviour relationships.

N2  -  The current optimal surgery for glioblastomas (GBMs) near the pyramidal tract (PT) is to remove as much tumor as possible and to preserve motor function. The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of tractography-integrated navigation-guided fence-post catheter techniques and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) for preserving postoperative motor function after GBM surgery. We retrospectively examined 49 patients who underwent resection for GBM near the PT. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography of the PT was performed preoperatively and integrated into the navigation system. When possible, silicon catheters were used as "fence-posts" and were inserted along the tumor boundaries, avoiding the PT, before tumor removal using the navigation system (fence-post catheter techniques). Cortical and subcortical MEPs were also monitored during resection of the tumor. Fence-post catheter techniques using a tractography-integrated navigation system were used in 45 of 49 patients. This technique enabled placement of the catheters, avoided the motor pathways, and allowed easier resection of the tumors. Tumors near the PT were resected using subcortical and cortical MEPs. The amplitudes of cortical MEPs after tumor removal were maintained at over 33 % of those obtained before resection. Thirty-six patients showed obvious responses of subcortical MEPs at a parts per thousand currency sign20 mA. The degree of resection was gross total in 21 patients, subtotal in 21, and partial in seven. One month after surgery, only one patient showed worsened motor function. Therefore, fence-post catheter techniques using a tractography-integrated navigation system and MEPs may contribute to preserving motor function after surgery for GBMs that are near the PT.

N2  -  Reading abilities and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were retrospectively analyzed in a group of neurosurgical patients to investigate (Study 1) the role of white matter-in particular the arcuate fasciculus (AF)-in preserved vs. impaired reading; 4 months after surgery, we explored the plasticity processes (Study 2). Study 1 involved 40 patients with brain glioma (23 low-grade and 17 high-grade gliomas). We compared preoperative DTI parameters of language-related fascicles between patients who developed a reading impairment after surgery (n = 23) and patients with preserved reading (n = 17). Besides lower fractional anisotropy (FA), patients with impaired reading also displayed lower number and density of streamlines of a direct (i.e., directly connecting temporal and frontal lobes) AF segment. In Study 2, we longitudinally tested at follow-up-when reading performance had generally improved-13 patients diagnosed with low-grade glioma. The most relevant finding was a significant increase in length of streamlines of the direct AF segments in both hemispheres. From a neurosurgical perspective, our preliminary findings suggest the clinical importance of sparing direct AF segments for the involvement they showed in reading; however, the results also suggest the reorganization potential of these segments, possibly compensating of the right homologs as well.

N2  -  The cerebellum was long perceived to be a region of limited importance with primary functions in the regulation of motor control. A degree of its functional topography in motor modulation has been traditionally appreciated. However, an evolving body of evidence supports its role in a range of cognitive processes, including executive decision making, language, emotional processing, and working memory. To this end, numerous studies of cerebellar stroke syndromes as well as investigations with functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging have given clinicians a better model of the functional topography within the cerebellum and the essential lanes of communication with the cerebrum. With this deeper understanding, neurosurgeons should integrate these domains into the perioperative evaluation and postoperative rehabilitation of patients with cerebellar tumors. This review aims to discuss these understandings and identify valuable tools for implementation into clinical practice.

N2  -  Hatton et al. analyze diffusion tensor imaging data from a large, international imaging dataset, including 1,069 controls and 1,249 patients with epilepsy. They find robust white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum, cingulum and external capsule bilaterally, with differing severity across epilepsy syndromes.
The epilepsies are commonly accompanied by widespread abnormalities in cerebral white matter. ENIGMA-Epilepsy is a large quantitative brain imaging consortium, aggregating data to investigate patterns of neuroimaging abnormalities in common epilepsy syndromes, including temporal lobe epilepsy, extratemporal epilepsy, and genetic generalized epilepsy. Our goal was to rank the most robust white matter microstructural differences across and within syndromes in a multicentre sample of adult epilepsy patients. Diffusion-weighted MRI data were analysed from 1069 healthy controls and 1249 patients: temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 599), temporal lobe epilepsy with normal MRI (n = 275), genetic generalized epilepsy (n = 182) and non-lesional extratemporal epilepsy (n = 193). A harmonized protocol using tract-based spatial statistics was used to derive skeletonized maps of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity for each participant, and fibre tracts were segmented using a diffusion MRI atlas. Data were harmonized to correct for scanner-specific variations in diffusion measures using a batch-effect correction tool (ComBat). Analyses of covariance, adjusting for age and sex, examined differences between each epilepsy syndrome and controls for each white matter tract (Bonferroni corrected at P < 0.001). Across 'all epilepsies' lower fractional anisotropy was observed in most fibre tracts with small to medium effect sizes, especially in the corpus callosum, cingulum and external capsule. There were also less robust increases in mean diffusivity. Syndrome-specific fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity differences were most pronounced in patients with hippocampal sclerosis in the ipsilateral parahippocampal cingulum and external capsule, with smaller effects across most other tracts. Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal MRI showed a similar pattern of greater ipsilateral than contralateral abnormalities, but less marked than those in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with generalized and extratemporal epilepsies had pronounced reductions in fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum, corona radiata and external capsule, and increased mean diffusivity of the anterior corona radiata. Earlier age of seizure onset and longer disease duration were associated with a greater extent of diffusion abnormalities in patients with hippocampal sclerosis. We demonstrate microstructural abnormalities across major association, commissural, and projection fibres in a large multicentre study of epilepsy. Overall, patients with epilepsy showed white matter abnormalities in the corpus callosum, cingulum and external capsule, with differing severity across epilepsy syndromes. These data further define the spectrum of white matter abnormalities in common epilepsy syndromes, yielding more detailed insights into pathological substrates that may explain cognitive and psychiatric co-morbidities and be used to guide biomarker studies of treatment outcomes andor genetic research.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: A comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationships between intracranial anatomy and pathological features is a crucial element in neurosurgical planning.
OBJECT: To assess our clinical experiences using a novel approach, stereoscopic virtual reality environment, to help neurosurgeons with both surgical training and surgical strategic planning purposes.; METHODS: Patient-specific digital imaging data obtained from a variety of different diagnostic sources (computed tomography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance, functional magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance-diffusion tensor imaging) were collected and then transferred to a workstation setting. These clinical data were obtained from 100 patients who were suffering from either brain vascular malformations or tumors that were located in difficult brain sites. A 3-dimensional volume rendering was produced for each of the 100 clinical cases, which were then subjected to data coregistration and fusion.; RESULTS: By using different head positioning systems and craniotomy options, we simulated microscopic visualizations of the lesion through numerous surgical approaches and from various angles of view. This simulation strategy enabled us to carry out an approach selection and eventually to identify the optimum angle of lesion visualization.; CONCLUSION: These virtual craniotomies successfully simulated a sampling of different operative environments that have the potential to play a significant role in neurosurgical training and operative planning worthy of further exploration and development.

N2  -  Increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was previously found in peritumoural oedema of glioblastomas (GBM). Supposing that peritumoural rCBV is not increased in metastases, we aimed to evaluate whether rCBV values of the whole peritumoural area are accurate to differentiate solitary metastasis from GBM irrespective of the peritumoural oedema.
Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2*-weighted dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI was performed in 52 patients with contrast-enhancing solitary brain tumours before surgery. In each T1-w slice depicting the contrast-enhancing tumour, a rim within approximately 15 mm was defined in the peritumoural area. The rCBV values were normalised to rCBV values of the contralateral normal white matter. Differences between metastases and GBM for normalised rCBV values for each slice were determined with the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05).; Histopathological examination revealed 29 GBM and 23 metastases. Peritumoural rCBV was significantly lower in metastases than in GBM (p < 0.01). Using the cutoff value 1.0 for discriminating metastases from GBM yielded a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 64%, a positive predictive value of 68% and a negative predictive value of 95%.; The rCBV in the peritumoural area of contrast-enhancing brain tumours has a high diagnostic accuracy to discriminate metastases from GBM irrespective of surrounding oedema and without the bias of slice selection and ROI positioning. Metastases should be excluded, if at least one tumour-depicting slice reveals an increase of peritumoural rCBV compared to the normal contralateral brain (normalised rCBV value > 1). Conversely, the decrease of peritumoural rCBV may not reliably exclude GBM.

N2  -  Objective: This study aimed to compare effects of cerebral small-vessel disease (cSVD) burden and cerebral artery stenosis (CAS) on acute ischemia in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and their interaction with mean arterial pressure (MAP) change.Methods: We recruited consecutive patients with acute primary ICH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography were performed to quantify diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions, CAS, and cSVD markers, which were calculated for the total cSVD score. Multivariable regression models were adopted to explore their associations by DWI lesions size (<15 vs. >= 15 mm) and median MAP change stratification.Results: Of 305 included patients (mean age 59.5 years, 67.9% males), 77 (25.2%) had DWI lesions (small, 79.2%; large, 20.8%) and 67 (22.0%) had moderate and severe CAS. In multivariable analysis, small DWI lesions were independently associated with higher total cSVD score (odds ratio [OR] 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.41). and large DWI lesions were associated with more severe CAS (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17-5.38). This association was modified by MAP change (interaction p = 0.016), with stratified analysis showing an increased risk of large DWI lesions in severe CAS with greater MAP change (>= 44 mmHg) (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.13-10.74) but not with mild MAP change (<44 mmHg) (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.20-7.34).Interpretation: Total cSVD burden is associated with small DWI lesions, whereas the degree of CAS is associated with large DWI lesions, specifically with greater MAP change, suggesting that large-artery atherosclerosis may be involved in ischemic brain injury, which is different from small-vessel pathogenesis in ICH.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are usually generated by built-in software provided by the MRI scanner vendors; however, various open-source postprocessing software packages are available for image manipulation and parametric map generation. The purpose of this study is to establish the reproducibility of absolute ADC values obtained using different postprocessing software programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. DW images with three b values were obtained with a 1.5-T MRI scanner, and the trace images were obtained. ADC maps were automatically generated by the in-line software provided by the vendor during image generation and were also separately generated on postprocessing software. These ADC maps were compared on the basis of ROIs using paired t test, Bland-Altman plot, mountain plot, and Passing-Bablok regression plot.; RESULTS. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean ADC values obtained from the different postprocessing software programs when the same baseline trace DW images were used for the ADC map generation.; CONCLUSION. For using ADC values as a quantitative cutoff for histologic characterization of tissues, standardization of the postprocessing algorithm is essential across processing software packages, especially in view of the implementation of vendor-neutral archiving.

N2  -  BackgroundHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury caused by asphyxia during perinatal period, which is one of the important causes of neonatal death and sequelae. Early and accurate diagnosis of HIE is of great significance for the prognostic evaluation of patients. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of diffusion-kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the diagnosis of early HIE.MethodsTwenty Yorkshire newborn piglets (3-5 days) were randomly divided into control group and experimental group. DWI and DKI scanning were performed at timepoints of 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h after hypoxic-ischemic exposure. At each timepoint, the parameter values obtained by each group scan were measured, and the lesion area of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and mean diffusion coefficient (MDC) map were measured. (For better interpretation of this study, we replaced the description of MD with MDC). Then, we completely removed the brain for pathological examination, and observed the state of cells and mitochondria in the ADC/MDC matching area (the actual area of the lesion), and the mismatch area (the area around the lesion).ResultsIn the experimental group, the ADC and MDC values decreased with time, but the MDC decreased more significantly and the change rate was higher. Both MDC and ADC values changed rapidly from 3 to 12 h and slowly from 12 to 24 h. The MDC and ADC images showed obvious lesions at 3 h for the first time. At this time, the area of ADC lesions was larger than that of MDC. As the lesions developed, the area of ADC maps was always larger than that of the MDC maps within 24 h. By observing the microstructure of the tissues by light microscopy, we found that the ADC and MDC matching area in the experimental group showed swelling of neurons, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and local necrotic lesions. Consistent with the observation under light microscope, pathological changes were observed in the matching ADC and MDC regions under electron microscopy as well, including collapse of mitochondrial membrane, fracture of partial mitochondrial ridge, and emergence of autophagosomes. In the mismatching region, the above pathological changes were not observed in the corresponding region of the ADC map.ConclusionsDKI's characteristic parameter MDC is better than ADC (parameter of DWI) to reflect the real area of the lesion. Therefore, DKI is superior to DWI in diagnosing early HIE.

N2  -  Introduction: Tractography is an invaluable tool in the planning of tumor surgery in the vicinity of functionally eloquent areas of the brain as well as in the research of normal development or of various diseases. The aim of our study was to compare the performance of a deep-learning-based image segmentation for the prediction of the topography of white matter tracts on T1-weighted MR images to the performance of a manual segmentation. Methods: T1-weighted MR images of 190 healthy subjects from 6 different datasets were utilized in this study. Using deterministic diffusion tensor imaging, we first reconstructed the corticospinal tract on both sides. After training a segmentation model on 90 subjects of the PIOP2 dataset using the nnU-Net in a cloud-based environment with graphical processing unit (Google Colab), we evaluated its performance using 100 subjects from 6 different datasets. Results: Our algorithm created a segmentation model that predicted the topography of the corticospinal pathway on T1-weighted images in healthy subjects. The average dice score was 0.5479 (0.3513-0.7184) on the validation dataset. Conclusions: Deep-learning-based segmentation could be applicable in the future to predict the location of white matter pathways in T1-weighted scans.

N2  -  Objective : T2 blackout (TBO) effect, which is a common finding in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and older population that are imaged for other reasons on diffusion weighted imagings (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map show the existence of paramagnetic materials in the tissue. Because iron is known to accumulate in especially deep gray matter (DGM) structures in MS brains, we aimed to investigate the relationship between TBO and clinico-radiological parameters that may be iron-related in MS.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the latest MR images of MS patients on 3 Tesla MR scanner between 2018 and 2019. TBO existence and severity on DWI-ADC was assessed by two radiologists and its correlation with several outcomes of MS was investigated.; Results: No significant relationship was found between TBO and gender, subtype of MS whereas TBO was positively correlated with parameters such as black-hole lesions, cortical atrophy, duration of disease, age and extended disability status scale (EDSS) score.; Conclusions: TBO shows correlation with the conditions which were revealed to be associated with iron accumulation in the brain of MS patients in the literature. Therefore, we concluded that TBO and its severity in DGM may represent iron accumulation in MS brains.; Advances in knowledge: TBO effect as a frequent imaging finding in daily practice may be used as predictor of the disease course of MS due to possible effects of iron accumulation in brain and thereby may be useful in modifying treatment strategies.

N2  -  To investigate fluctuations in the amplitude of low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during acute brain ischemia, and to evaluate the use of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) in resting state fMRI for assessing super-acute focal cerebral ischemic stroke. A super-acute stroke model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat was employed. Spontaneous fluctuations were recorded using a series of gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) images before and 30 min, 60 min, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after MCAO. After preprocessing, serial fMRI data were obtained by fast Fourier transformation to calculate the ALFFs. Statistical parametric mapping software was used for the statistical analysis of ALFFs. T2-weighted images and diffusion weighted images (DWI) were also performed to detect the ischemic lesion. The signal intensities of abnormal ALFFs increased and migrated from the core of the ischemic lesion areas to the edge of lesion following MCAO. The dynamic changes in the ALFF maps demonstrated that the sizes of the ALFF regions exceeded beyond the borderline of the DWI lesions during the super-acute ischemic stroke stage. There was a significant difference in the ALFFs maps between the ischemic stroke group and the control group (P < 0.005; cluster size > 10 voxels), which mainly occurred in the periphery of the ischemic region in the cortex. These data suggest that ALFF maps provide hemodynamic BOLD information on neural activity, and have potential for predicting survival and prognosis of acute ischemic brain tissues.

N2  -  Background/Aims: Early neurological deterioration (END) is frequently observed and related to poor functional outcome in patients with single subcortical infarction (SSI). We evaluated the role of diffusion-perfusion mismatch (DPM) as a predictor of END and functional outcome in patients with SSI. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data for 274 patients with acute SSI. DPM was positive in the presence of a lesion on the perfusion map that was larger than that on the corresponding slice on diffusion-weighted imaging. END was defined as an increase of < 1 points in the motor portion of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 72 h from MRI acquisition. Patients with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 or more at day 30 were considered having a poor functional outcome. Results: DPM was more frequently observed in the END (+) than in the END (-) group (21/35 (60.0%) vs. 50/239 (20.9%); p < 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, the presence of DPM and NIHSS score on admission were independently associated with END (DPM, OR 5.03, p < 0.001; NIHSS, OR 1.14, p = 0.033) and poor function-al outcome (DPM, OR 2.44, p = 0.018; NIHSS, OR 1.48, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The DPM concept is applicable to prediction of END and functional disability in patients with SSI. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  ObjectiveSynthetic MRI (SyMRI) can reconstruct different contrast-weighted images(T1, T2, PD) and has shorter scan time, easier post-processing and better reproducibility. Some studies have shown splendid correlation with conventional mapping techniques and no degradation in the quality of syMRI images compared with conventional MRI. It is crucial to select an individualized treatment plan based on the preoperative images of rectal carcinoma (RC). We tried to explore the feasibility of syMRI on T, N stage and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) of rectal cancer. Materials and MethodsA total of 100 patients (37 females and 63 males) diagnosed with rectal carcinoma were enrolled. All the patients underwent preoperative pelvic MR examinations including conventional MR sequence and synthetic MRI. Two radiologists evaluated the MRI findings of each rectal carcinoma and EMVI score in consensus. The values for T1, T2 relaxation times and PD value were measured in tumor(ROI-1) and pararectal fat space(ROI-2) and analyzed independently. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Correlations between the T1, T2 and PD values and EMVI score were also evaluated. ResultsCompared with the normal rectal wall, the values of T1 and T2 relaxation times of the tumor were significantly higher (P <0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the PD value (P >0.05). As for ROI, the ROI of pararectal fat space(ROI-2) had better significance than rectal cancer lesion (ROI-1). T2 value of ROI-1 and T1 value of ROI-2 were higher in the pEMVI positive group than in the negative group (P=0.002 and 0.001) and T1 value of ROI-2 had better performance with an AUC of 0.787, (95% CI:0.693- 0.882). T1 value, T2 value and PD value from ROI-2 were effective for both T and N stage of rectal cancer. High-grade pathological stage had showed higher T1 value (P-T stage=0.013,P-N stage=0.035), lower T2 value (P-T stage=0.025,P-N stage=0.034) and lower PD value (P-T stage=0.017). We also enrolled the characteristics with P < 0.05 in the combined model which had better diagnostic efficacy. A significant positive correlation was found between the T1 value of pararectal fat space(ROI-2) and EMVI score (r value = 0.519, P<0.001). The T2 value(r=0.213,P=0.049) and PD value(r=0.354,P=0.001) from ROI-1 was correlated with EMVI score. Correlation analysis did not show any significant associations between T2 value of tumor, T2, PD values of pararectal fat space and EMVI scores. ConclusionSynthetic MRI can provide multi-parameter quantitative image maps with a easier measurement and slightly shorter acquisition time compared with conventional MRI. The measurement of multi-parametric quantitative values contributes to diagnosing the tumor and evaluating T stage, N stage and EMVI. It has the potential to be used as a preoperative diagnostic and grading technique in rectal carcinoma.

N2  -  A significant challenge in Glioblastoma (GBM) management is identifying pseudo-progression (PsP), a benign radiation-induced effect, from tumor recurrence, on routine imaging following conventional treatment. Previous studies have linked tumor lobar presence and laterality to GBM outcomes, suggesting that disease etiology and progression in GBM may be impacted by tumor location. Hence, in this feasibility study, we seek to investigate the following question: Can tumor location on treatment-naive MRI provide early cues regarding likelihood of a patient developing pseudo-progression vs. tumor recurrence? In this study, 74 pre-treatment Glioblastoma MRI scans with PsP (33) and tumor recurrence (41) were analyzed. First, enhancing lesion on Gd-T-1w MRI and peri-lesional hyperintensities on T-2w/FLAIR were segmented by experts and then registered to a brain atlas. Using patients from the two phenotypes, we construct two atlases by quantifying frequency of occurrence of enhancing lesion and peri-lesion hyperintensities, by averaging voxel intensities across the population. Analysis of differential involvement was then performed to compute voxel-wise significant differences (p-value < 0.05) across the atlases. Statistically significant clusters were finally mapped to a structural atlas to provide anatomic localization of their location. Our results demonstrate that patients with tumor recurrence showed prominence of their initial tumor in the parietal lobe, while patients with PsP showed a multi-focal distribution of the initial tumor in the frontal and temporal lobes, insula, and putamen. These preliminary results suggest that lateralization of pre-treatment lesions toward certain anatomical areas of the brain may allow to provide early cues regarding assessing likelihood of occurrence of pseudo-progression from tumor recurrence on MRI scans.

N2  -  Background: Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and the spherical mean technique (SMT) are diffusion MRI methods providing metrics with sensitivity to similar characteristics of white matter microstructure. There has been limited comparison of changes in NODDI and SMT parameters due to multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology in clinical settings. Purpose: To compare group-wise differences between healthy controls and MS patients in NODDI and SMT metrics, investigating associations with disability and correlations with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics. Methods: Sixty three relapsing-remitting MS patients were compared to 28 healthy controls. NODDI and SMT metrics corresponding to intracellular volume fraction (v(in)), orientation dispersion (ODI and ODE), diffusivity (D) (SMT only) and isotropic volume fraction (v(iso)) (NODDI only) were calculated from diffusion MRI data, alongside DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, FA; axial/mean/radial diffusivity, AD/MD/RD). Correlations between all pairs of MRI metrics were calculated in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Associations with expanded disability status scale (EDSS), controlling for age and gender, were evaluated. Patient-control differences were assessed voxel-by-voxel in MNI space controlling for age and gender at the 5% significance level, correcting for multiple comparisons. Spatial overlap of areas showing significant differences were compared using Dice coefficients. Results: NODDI and SMT show significant associations with EDSS (standardised beta coefficient -0.34 in NAWM and -0.37 in lesions for NODDI v(in); 0.38 and -0.31 for SMT ODE and v(in) in lesions; p < 0.05). Significant correlations in NAWM are observed between DTI and NODDI/SMT metrics. NODDI v(in) and SMT v(in) strongly correlated (r = 0.72, p < 0.05), likewise NODDI ODI and SMT ODE (r = -0.80, p < 0.05). All DTI, NODDI and SMT metrics detect widespread differences between patients and controls in NAWM (12.57% and 11.90% of MNI brain mask for SMT and NODDI v(in), Dice overlap of 0.42). Data Conclusion: SMT and NODDI detect significant differences in white matter microstructure between MS patients and controls, concurring on the direction of these changes, providing consistent descriptors of tissue microstructure that correlate with disability and show alterations beyond focal damage. Our study suggests that NODDI and SMT may play a role in monitoring MS in clinical trials and practice.

N2  -  Quantitative and qualitative autoradiographic methods together with lesion approaches were used to determine the distribution of [H-3]ryanodine binding sites in rat brain and the neuronal localization of these sites in the hippocampus. In normal animals, levels of [H-3]ryanodine binding sites ranged from a low of about 1 fmol/mg tissue in subcortical structures to a high of 12-18 fmol/mg tissue in subregions of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. Relatively high densities of sites (5-9 fmol/mg tissue) were also seen in the olfactory tubercle, most areas of the cerebral cortex, accumbens nucleus, striatum. lateral septal nuclei, pontine nucleus, superior colliculus and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. Specific binding was undetectable in white matter. In experimental animals, intracerebral injections of kainic acid caused neuronal degeneration and a near total depletion of [H-3]ryanodine binding sites in the dentate gyrus and in fields CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus. Injections of kainic acid that left dentate granule cells largely intact while destroying all neurons in field CA3 had no effect on binding sites in the dentate gyrus. However, these lesions substantially reduced the density of binding in field CA3, leaving a narrow band of sites outlining the position of the degenerated CA3 pyramidal cells. Mechanical knife-cut lesions that severed the granule cell mossy fiber input to field CA3 reduced the density of binding sites in the CA3 region. The results indicate that [H-3]ryanodine binding sites in brain are heterogeneously distributed and suggest that a proportion of these sites in the hippocampus may be contained in mossy fiber terminals where a presumptive calcium channel/ryanodine receptor complex may be involved in the regulation of calcium mobilization and/or neurotransmitter release.

N2  -  The somatotopic organization of the primary motor cortex is well documented. However, a possible somatotopy of the network involved in motor control, i.e., eliciting negative motor phenomena during electrostimulation, is unknown in humans, particularly at the subcortical level. Here, we performed electrical stimulation mapping in awake patients operated for gliomas, to study the distribution of the white matter tracts subserving movement control of the lower limb, upper limb(s), and speech. Eighteen patients underwent awake surgery for frontal low-grade gliomas, by using intraoperative subcortical electrostimulation mapping to search interference with movement of the leg, arm(s), and face. We assessed the negative motor responses and their distribution throughout the tracts located under premotor areas. The corresponding stimulation sites were reported on a standard brain template for visual analysis and between-subjects comparisons. During stimulation of the white matter underneath the dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, rostral to the corticospinal tracts, all patients experienced cessation of the movement of lower and upper limbs, of bimanual coordination, and/or speech. These subcortical sites were somatotopically distributed. Indeed, stimulation of the fibers from mesial to lateral directions and from posterior to anterior directions evoked arrest of movement of the lower limb (mesially and posteriorly), upper limb(s), and face/speech (laterally and anteriorly). There were no postoperative permanent deficits. This is the first evidence of a somatotopic organization of the white matter bundles underpinning movement control in humans. A better knowledge of the distribution of this motor control network may be helpful in neurosciences and neurosurgery.

N2  -  Olfactory bulb efferents sweep caudally over the surface of the piriform lobe [of Mesocricetus auratus] in a broad fiber sheet. The internal organization of this axon population was analyzed by topologically transforming the cortical surface from its in situ cylindrical form into an unrolled (flattened) map. The distribution of degeneration elicited by restricted bulb lesions and fiber transections was then reconstructed onto this map. Most of the projection cortex of the main olfactory bulb was innervated in a widespread, non-topographic manner by axons that collect in the compact bundle of the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). LOT collateral branches bound for the prepiriform cortex veered laterally off the main trajectory of the tract at an angle of 50.degree. or less. Transection of discrete fiber populations left only a small wedge-shaped pocket of totally denervated cortex distal to the cut. The medial half of the olfactory tubercle and the hippocampal rudiment received their bulbar input along medially disposed fibers that did not join the LOT proper. The lateral half of the olfactory tubercle received an input from LOT fiber collaterals and these medial bulb efferents. Much of the corticomedial amygdaloid complex received fibers from the accessory olfactory bulb along a specialized subdivision of the LOT, the accessory olfactory tract. These observations are expressed in a schematic summary of the trajectories of olfactory bulb efferents as they appear in the unrolled map and in the more standard ventral view of the hamster brain.

N2  -  Advances in neuroimaging have enabled the mapping of white matter connections across the entire brain, allowing for a more thorough examination of the extent of white matter disconnection after stroke. To assess how cortical disconnection contributes to motor impairments, we examined the relationship between structural brain connectivity and upper and lower extremity motor function in individuals with chronic stroke. Forty-three participants [mean age: 59.7 (+/- 11.2) years; time poststroke: 64.4 (+/- 58.8) months] underwent clinical motor assessments and MRI scanning. Nonparametric correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between structural connectivity amid a subsection of the motor network and upper/lower extremity motor function. Standard multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between cortical necrosis and disconnection of three main cortical areas of motor control [primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and supplementary motor area (SMA)] and motor function. Anatomical connectivity between ipsilesional M1/SMA and the (1) cerebral peduncle, (2) thalamus, and (3) red nucleus were significantly correlated with upper and lower extremity motor performance (P0.003). M1-M1 interhemispheric connectivity was also significantly correlated with gross manual dexterity of the affected upper extremity (P=0.001). Regression models with M1 lesion load and M1 disconnection (adjusted for time poststroke) explained a significant amount of variance in upper extremity motor performance (R-2=0.36-0.46) and gait speed (R-2=0.46), with M1 disconnection an independent predictor of motor performance. Cortical disconnection, especially of ipsilesional M1, could significantly contribute to variability seen in locomotor and upper extremity motor function and recovery in chronic stroke.

N2  -  The cholinergic innervation of the cerebellar cortex of the rat, rabbit, cat and monkey was studied by immunohistochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and radiochemical measurement of regional differences in ChAT activity. Four antibodies to ChAT were used to find optimal immunohistochemical localization of this enzyme. These antibodies selectively labeled large mossy fiber rosettes as well as finely beaded terminals with different morphological characterization, laminar distribution within the cerebellar cortex, and regional differences within the cerebellum.
Large "grape-like" classic ChAT-positive mossy fiber rosettes that were distributed primarily in the granule cell layer were concentrated, but not exclusively located in three separate regions of the cerebellum in each of the four species studied: 1) The uvula-nodulus (lobules 9 and 10); 2) the flocculus-ventral paraflocculus, and 3) the anterior lobe vermis (lobules 1 and 2). No intrinsic cerebellar neurons were labeled. No cells in either the inferior olive (the origin of cerebellar climbing fibers) or in the locus coeruleus (an origin of noradrenergic fibers) were ChAT-positive.; Thin, finely beaded axons, similar to cholinergic axons of the cerebral cortex of the rat, were observed in both the granule cell layer and molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex of the rat, rabbit and cat.; The regional differences in ChAT-positive afferent terminations in the cerebellar cortex was for the most part confirmed by regional measurements of ChAT activity in the rat, rabbit, and cat. The three cholinergic afferent projection sites correspond to regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive vestibular primary and secondary afferents. These data imply that a subset of vestibular projections to the cerebellar cortex are cholinergic.

N2  -  Background Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) measures have been shown to provide increased sensitivity relative to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting pathologies.
Purpose To compare the sensitivity of DKI-derived kurtosis and diffusion maps for assessment of low-grade gliomas (LGG).; Study Type Prospective study.; Population In all, 19 LGG patients and 26 healthy control subjects were recruited.; Field StrengthSequence Echo-planar-imaging diffusion-weighted MR images (b-values = 0, 1000, and 2000 with 30 diffusion gradient directions) were acquired on a 3T scanner.; Assessment Maps for mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD) and kurtosis (MK, AK, and RK), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated in the tumor, perilesional white matter, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter regions.; Statistical Testing General linear models (GLM), Cohen's d for effect size estimates, false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple corrections, Cochran Q-test.; Results Pairwise differences were observed for all diffusion and kurtosis measures between the studied regions (FDR P < 0.001), except an FA map that failed to show significant differences between the lesion and perilesional white matter (FDR P = 0.373). Effect size analysis showed that kurtosis metrics were found to be 18.8% (RK, P = 0.144) to 29.1% (AK, P < 0.05) more sensitive in discriminating perilesional regions from the lesion than corresponding diffusion metrics, whereas AK provided a 25.0% (P < 0.05) increase in sensitivity in discriminating perilesional and contralateral white matter. RK was found to be the most sensitive to contralateral white matter differences between low-grade gliomas and controls, with MK and RK providing a significantly greater sensitivity of 587.2% (P < 0.001) and 320.7% (P < 0.001) than MD and RD, respectively.; Data Conclusion Kurtosis maps showed increased sensitivity, as compared to counterpart diffusion maps, for evaluation of microstructural changes in gliomas with a 3-6-fold increment in assessing changes in contralateral white matter.

N2  -  Studies investigating dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging-determined relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps as a metric of treatment response assessment have generated conflicting results. We evaluated the potential of various analytical techniques to predict survival of patients with glioma treated with chemoradiation. rCBV maps were acquired in patients with high-grade gliomas at 0, 1, and 3 weeks into chemoradiation therapy. Various analytical techniques were applied to the same cohort of serial rCBV data for early assessment of survival. Three different methodologies were investigated: 1) percentage change of whole tumor statistics (i.e., mean, median, and percentiles), 2) physiological segmentation (low rCBV, medium rCBV, or high rCBV), and 3) a voxel-based approach, parametric response mapping (PRM). All analyses were performed using the same tumor contours, which were determined using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. The predictive potential of each response metric was assessed at 1-year and overall survival. PRM was the only analytical approach found to generate a response metric significantly predictive of patient 1-year survival. Time of acquisition and contour volume were not found to alter the sensitivity of the PRM approach for predicting overall survival. We have demonstrated the importance of the analytical approach in early response assessment using serial rCBV maps. The PRM analysis shows promise as a unified early and robust imaging biomarker of treatment response in patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: High-field, intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) achieves free tumor margins in glioma surgery by involving anatomic neuronavigation and sophisticated functional imaging.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of perfusion-weighted iMRI as an aid to detect residual tumor and to guide its resection.; METHODS: Twenty-two patients undergoing intraoperative scanning (in a dual-room 1.5-T magnet setting) during the resection of high-grade gliomas were examined with perfusion-weighted iMRI. The generated relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were scrutinized for any hot spots indicative of tumor remnants, and region-of-interest analysis was performed. Differences among the rCBV region-of-interest estimates in residual tumor, free tumor margins, and normal white matter were analyzed. Histopathology of the tissue specimens and the neurosurgeon's intraoperative macroscopic estimations were considered the reference standards.; RESULTS: In all cases, diagnostic rCBV perfusion maps were generated. Interpretation of perfusion maps demonstrated that gross total resection of gliomas was achieved in 4 of 22 cases (18%), which was macroscopically and histopathologically verified, whereas in 18 of 22 cases (82%), the perfusion-weighted iMRI revealed hot spots indicating subtotal tumor removal. The latter proved to be true in all but 1 case. The receiver-operating characteristic curves of the qualitative visual and quantitative analyses showed excellent sensitivity and specificity rates. Statistical analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences for the mean rCBV and maximum rCBV between residual disease and tumor-free margins (P = .002 for both).; CONCLUSION: Perfusion-weighted iMRI may be implemented easily into imaging protocols and may assist the surgeon in detecting residual tumor volume.

N2  -  Objective: To determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could identify potentially clinically relevant findings in patients presenting more than 6 hours after stroke onset when compared with conventional MRI. Methods: MRI with both conventional (T2 and proton density images) and echoplanar imaging (DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient maps) was performed 6 to 48 hours after symptom onset (mean, 27 hours) in 40 consecutive patients with acute stroke. All acute lesions were identified first on conventional images, then on DWI, by a neuroradiologist who was provided with the suspected lesion location, based on a neurologist's examination before imaging. Abnormalities were rated as potentially clinically relevant if they were detected only on DWI and 1) confirmed the acute symptomatic lesion to be in a different vascular territory than suspected clinically, 2) revealed multiple lesions in different vascular territories suggestive of a proximal source of embolism, or 3) clarified that a lesion, thought to be acute on conventional imaging, was not acute. Results: The initial clinical impression of lesion localization was incorrect in 12 patients (30%), Clinically significant findings were detected by DWI alone in 19 patients (48%). DWI demonstrated the symptomatic lesion in a different vascular territory than suspected clinically or by conventional MRI in 7 patients (18%) and showed acute lesions in multiple vascular distributions in 5 patients (13%). In 8 patients (20%), DWI clarified that lesions thought to be acute on conventional MRI were actually old. Conclusion: In patients imaged 6 to 48 hours after stroke onset, DWI frequently provided potentially clinically relevant findings that were not apparent on conventional MRI.

N2  -  Metabolic and structural changes occur in brain tissue within minutes of ischemia. The adiabatic multi-echo (Carr-Purcell) localization pulse sequence LASER has shown promise in detecting tissue contrast changes within the first hour of ischemia. The purpose of this initial study was to combine the LASER localization sequence with fast 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI) to quantify the regional apparent transverse relaxation (T-2 dagger) in a rabbit model of acute embolic ischemia at 4 Tesla. Carr-Purcell T-2 dagger-weighted images were acquired at 7 different echo-times and used to estimate T-2 dagger in both cortex and striatum. In ischemic tissue identified by 2,3,5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, the T-2 dagger increased by approximately 31% after 1 hour of ischemia and remained elevated until study completion at 4 h of ischemia. Lesion volume, defined as the number of pixels with T-2(dagger) greater than 90 ms, increased by 40% between 1 and 4 h after induction of ischemia. Carr-Purcell LASER-EPI T-2(dagger)-weighted images show promise in detecting early tissue changes in focal cerebral ischemia. Magn Reson Med 54:1448-1454, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To develop an asleep motor mapping paradigm for accurate detection of the corticospinal tract during glioma surgery and compare outcomes with awake patients undergoing glioma resection.
METHODS: A consecutive cohort of adult patients undergoing craniotomy for suspected diffuse glioma with tumor in a perirolandic location who had awake or asleep cortical and subcortical motor mapping with positive areas of motor stimulation were assessed for postoperative extent of resection (EOR), permanent neurological deficit, and proximity of stimulation to diffusion tensor imaging-based corticospinal tract depiction on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Outcome data were compared between asleep and awake groups.; RESULTS: In the asleep group, all 16 patients had improved or no change in motor function at last follow-up (minimum 3 months of follow-up). In the awake group, all 23 patients had improved function or no change at last follow-up. EOR was greater in the asleep group (mean SD EOR 88.71% 17.56%) versus the awake group (mean SD EOR 80.62% 24.44%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.3802). Linear regression comparing distance from stimulation to corticospinal tract in asleep (n = 14) and awake (n = 4) patients was r = - 0.3759, R-2 = 0.1413, P = 0.1853, and 95% confidence interval = -0.4453 to 0.09611 and r = 0.7326, R-2 = 0.5367, P = 0.2674, and 95% confidence interval = -7.042 to 14.75, respectively.; CONCLUSION: In this small patient series, asleep motor mapping using commonly available motor evoked potential hardware appears to be safe and efficacious in regard to EOR and functional outcomes.

N2  -  Simple Summary Diffuse midline glioma is a rare distinct brain tumor entity introduced by the recent WHO (Lyon, France) brain tumor classification. MR imaging is important for detection as well as characterization of these midline tumors, which are located within the brainstem, since neurosurgical tissue sampling in these locations can be challenging. We therefore searched for possible differences in the MRI pattern between diffuse midline gliomas and midline glioblastomas, both regarded as grade IV entities. We conducted a two-center retrospective survey on standard MRI features including apparent diffusion coefficient mapping (ADC) of diffuse midline gliomas H3 K27M-mutant (DMG) compared to midline glioblastomas H3 K27M-wildtype (midGBM-H3wt). We identified 39 intracranial DMG and 18 midGBM-H3wt tumors. Samples were microscopically re-evaluated for microvascular proliferations and necrosis. Image analysis focused on location, peritumoral edema, degree of contrast enhancement and DWI features. Within DMG, MRI features between tumors with or without histomorphological GBM features were compared. DMG occurred in 15/39 samples from the thalamus (38%), in 23/39 samples from the brainstem (59%) and in 1/39 tumors involving primarily the cerebellum (2%). Edema was present in 3/39 DMG cases (8%) versus 78% in the control (midGBM-H3wt) group (p < 0.001). Contrast enhancement at the tumor rim was detected in 17/39 DMG (44%) versus 67% in control (p = 0.155), and necrosis in 24/39 (62%) versus 89% in control (p = 0.060). Strong contrast enhancement was observed in 15/39 DMG (38%) versus 56% in control (p = 0.262). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis showed significantly higher skewness and kurtosis values in the DMG group compared to the controls (p = 0.0016/p = 0.002). Minimum relative ADC (rADC) values, as well as the 10th and 25th rADC-percentiles, were lower in DMGs with GBM features within the DMG group (p < 0.001/p = 0.012/p = 0.027). In conclusion, DMG cases exhibited markedly less edema than midGBM-H3wt, even if histomorphological malignancy was present. Histologically malignant DMGs and midGBM-H3wt more often displayed strong enhancement, as well as rim enhancement, than DMGs without histomorphological malignancy. DMGs showed higher skewness and kurtosis values on ADC-histogram analysis compared to midGBM-H3wt. Lower minimum rADC values in DMGs indicated malignant histomorphological features, likely representing a more complex tissue microstructure.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Previous studies have suggested that patients' potential for poststroke language recovery is related to lesion size; however, lesion location may also be of importance, particularly when fiber tracts that are critical to the sensorimotor mapping of sounds for articulation (eg, the arcuate fasciculus) have been damaged. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lesion loads of the arcuate fasciculus (ie, volume of arcuate fasciculus that is affected by a patient's lesion) and of 2 other tracts involved in language processing (the extreme capsule and the uncinate fasciculus) are inversely related to the severity of speech production impairments in patients with stroke with aphasia.
Methods-Thirty patients with chronic stroke with residual impairments in speech production underwent high-resolution anatomic MRI and a battery of cognitive and language tests. Impairment was assessed using 3 functional measures of spontaneous speech (eg, rate, informativeness, and overall efficiency) as well as naming ability. To quantitatively analyze the relationship between impairment scores and lesion load along the 3 fiber tracts, we calculated tract-lesion overlap volumes for each patient using probabilistic maps of the tracts derived from diffusion tensor images of 10 age-matched healthy subjects.; Results-Regression analyses showed that arcuate fasciculus lesion load, but not extreme capsule or uncinate fasciculus lesion load or overall lesion size, significantly predicted rate, informativeness, and overall efficiency of speech as well as naming ability.; Conclusions-A new variable, arcuate fasciculus lesion load, complements established voxel-based lesion mapping techniques and, in the future, may potentially be used to estimate impairment and recovery potential after stroke and refine inclusion criteria for experimental rehabilitation programs.

N2  -  Introduction: Despite complete recanalization by mechanical thrombectomy, abnormal perfusion can be detected on MRI obtained post-endovascular therapy (EVT). The presence of residual perfusion abnormalities post-EVT may be associated with blood-brain barrier breakdown in response to mechanical disruption of the endothelium from multiple-pass thrombectomy. We hypothesize that multiple-pass versus single-pass thrombectomy is associated with a higher rate of residual hypoperfusion and increased lesion growth at 24 h. Materials and Methods: For this analysis, we included patients presenting to one of two stroke centers between January 2015 and February 2018 with an acute ischemic stroke within 12 h from symptom onset if they had a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation documented on magnetic resonance angiography or CTA, baseline MRI pre-EVT with imaging evidence of hypoperfusion, underwent EVT, and had a post-EVT MRI with qualitatively interpretable perfusion-weighted imaging data at 24 h. MRI T-max maps using a time delay threshold of >6 s were used to quantitate hypoperfusion volumes. Residual hypoperfusion at 24 h was solely defined as T-max volume >10 mL with >6 s delay. Complete recanalization was defined as modified treatment in cerebral infarction visualized on angiography at EVT completion. Hyperintense acute reperfusion injury marker was assessed on post-EVT pre-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery at 24 h. Major early neurological improvement was defined as a reduction of the admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by >= 8 points or a score of 0-1 at 24 h. Good functional outcome was defined as 0-2 on the modified Rankin Scale on day 30 or 90. Results: Fifty-five patients were included with median age 67 years, 58% female, 45% Black/African American, 36% White/Caucasian, median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 19, large vessel occlusion locations: 71% M1, 14.5% iICA, 14.5% M2, 69% treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Of these, 58% had multiple-pass thrombectomy, 39% had residual perfusion abnormalities at 24 h, and 64% had severe hyperintense acute reperfusion injury marker at 24 h. After adjusting for complete recanalization, only multiple-pass thrombectomy (odds ratio, 4.3 95% CI, 1.07-17.2; p = 0.04) was an independent predictor of residual hypoperfusion at 24 h. Patients with residual hypoperfusion had larger lesion growth on diffusion-weighted imaging (59 mL vs. 8 mL, p < 0.001), lower rate of major early neurological improvement (24% vs. 70%, p = 0.002) at 24 h, and worse long-term outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale at 30 or 90 days, 5 versus 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that incomplete reperfusion on post-EVT MRI is present even in some patients with successful recanalization at the time of EVT and is associated with multiple-pass thrombectomy, lesion growth, and worse outcome. Future studies are needed to investigate whether patients with residual hypoperfusion may benefit from immediate adjunctive therapy to limit lesion growth and improve clinical outcome.

N2  -  A number of studies have revealed the usefulness of multimodal imaging in gliomas. Although the results have been heavily affected by the method used for region of interest (ROI) design, the most discriminatory method for setting the ROI remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the most suitable ROI design for F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and C-11-methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the viewpoint of grades of non-enhancing gliomas. A total of 31 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed magnetic resonance (MR) non-enhancing gliomas who underwent FDG-PET, MET-PET and DTI were retrospectively investigated. Quantitative measurements were performed using four different ROIs; hotspot/tumor center and whole tumor, constructed in either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). Histopathological grading of the tumor was considered as empirical truth and the quantitative measurements obtained from each ROI was correlated with the grade of the tumor. The most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the different imaging modalities. 2D-hotspot/center ROI was most discriminating for FDG-PET (P=0.087), ADC map (P=0.0083), and FA map (P=0.25), whereas 3D-whole tumor ROI was best for MET-PET (P=0.0050). In the majority of scenarios, 2D-ROIs performed better than 3D-ROIs. Results from the image analysis using FDG-PET, MET-PET, ADC and FA may be affected by ROI design and the most discriminating ROI for non-enhancing glioma grading was different according to the imaging modality.

N2  -  Background: To identify quantitative MRI parameters associated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fast bound-pool fraction imaging (FBFI) that may detect alterations in gray matter and/or white matter in adults with Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.
Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy controls (mean age 6 standard deviation: 48.0 +- 12.4 years) and 10 participants with Fabry disease (46.7 +- 12.9 years) were imaged at 3.0 Tesla. Whole-brain parametric maps of diffusion tensor metrics (apparent diffusion coefficient ADC and fractional anisotropy FA) and the bound-pool fraction (f) were acquired. Mean voxel values of parametric maps from regions-of-interest within gray and white matter structures were compared between cases and controls using the independent t-test. Spearman's rho was used to identify associations between parametric maps and age.; Results: Compared with controls, the left thalamus of Fabry participants had an increase in FA (0.29 +- 0.02 versus 0.33 +- 0.05, respectively; P = 0.030) and a trend toward an increase in ADC (0.73 +- 00.02 versus 0.76 +- 0.03 mu m(2)s, respectively; P = 0.082). The left posterior white matter demonstrated a reduction in f (10.45 +- 0.37 versus 9.00 +- 1.84%, respectively; P = 0.035), an increase in ADC (0.78 +- 0.04 versus 0.94 +- 0.19 mu m(2)s, respectively; P = 0.024), and a trend toward a reduction in FA (0.42 +- 0.07 versus 0.36 +- 0.08, respectively; P = 0.052). Among all parameters, only f measured in the left posterior white matter was significantly associated with age in Fabry participants (rho = -0.71; P = 0.022).; Conclusion: Parameters derived from DTI and FBFI detect Fabry-related changes in the adult human brain, particularly in the posterior white matter where reductions in myelin density as measured by FBFI appear age related.

N2  -  Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of mapping cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data without gas or other challenges in patients with cerebrovascular diseases and to show that brain regions affected by the diseases have diminished vascular reactivity.
Materials and methods: Two sub-studies were performed on patients with stroke and Moyamoya disease. In Study 1, 20 stroke patients (56.3 +- 9.7 years, 7 females) were enrolled and resting-state blood-oxygenation-level dependent (rs-BOLD) fMRI data were collected, from which CVR maps were computed. CVR values were compared across lesion, perilesional and control ROIs defined on anatomic images. Reproducibility of the CVR measurement was tested in 6 patients with follow-up scans. In Study 2, rs-BOLD fMRI and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI scans were collected in 5 patients with Moyamoya disease (32.4 +- 8.2 years, 4 females). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and time-to-peak (TTP) maps were obtained from the DSC MRI data. CVR values were compared between stenotic brain regions and control regions perfused by nonstenotic arteries.; Results: In stroke patients, lesion CVR (0.250 +- 0.055 relative unit (r.u.)) was lower than control CVR (0.731 +- 0.088 r.u., p = 0.0002). CVR was also lower in the perilesional regions in a graded manner (perilesion 1 CVR = 0.422 +- 0.051 r.u., perilesion 2 CVR = 0.492 +- 0.046 r.u.), relative to that in the control regions (p = 0.005 and 0.036, respectively). In the repeatability analysis, a strong correlation was observed between lesion CVR (r(2) = 0.91, p = 0.006) measured at two time points, as well as between control CVR (r(2) = 0.79, p = 0.036) at two time points. In Moyamoya patients, CVR in the perfusion deficit regions delineated by DSC TTP maps (0.178 +- 0.189 r.u.) was lower than that in the control regions (0.868 +- 0.214 r.u., p = 0.013). Furthermore, the extent of reduction in CVR was significantly correlated with the extent of lengthening in TTP (r(2) = 0.91, p = 0.033).; Conclusion: Our findings suggested that rs-BOLD data can be used to reproducibly evaluate CVR in patients with cerebrovascular diseases without the use of any vasoactive challenges.

N2  -  Control of the hand muscles during fine digit movements requires a high level of sensorimotor integration, which relies on a complex network of cortical and subcortical hubs. The components of this network have been extensively studied in human and non-human primates, but discrepancies in the findings obtained from different mapping approaches are difficult to interpret. In this study, we defined the cortical and connectional components of the hand motor network in the same cohort of 20 healthy adults and 3 neurosurgical patients. We used multimodal structural magnetic resonance imaging (including T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tractography), as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). The motor map obtained from nTMS compared favourably with the one obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging, both of which overlapped well within the 'hand-knob' region of the precentral gyrus and in an adjacent region of the postcentral gyrus. nTMS stimulation of the precentral and postcentral gyri led to motor-evoked potentials in the hand muscles in all participants, with more responses recorded from precentral stimulations. We also observed that precentral stimulations tended to produce motor-evoked potentials with shorter latencies and higher amplitudes than postcentral stimulations. Tractography showed that the region of maximum overlap between terminations of precentral-postcentral U-shaped association fibres and somatosensory projection tracts colocalizes with the functional motor maps. The relationships between the functional maps, and between them and the tract terminations, were replicated in the patient cohort. Three main conclusions can be drawn from our study. First, the hand-knob region is a reliable anatomical landmark for the functional localization of fine digit movements. Second, its distinctive shape is determined by the convergence of highly myelinated long projection fibres and short U-fibres. Third, the unique role of the hand-knob area is explained by its direct action on the spinal motoneurons and the access to high-order somatosensory information for the online control of fine movements. This network is more developed in the hand region compared to other body parts of the homunculus motor strip, and it may represent an important target for enhancing motor learning during early development.
Using multimodal brain imaging, Beyh et al. show that the 'hand-knob' cortical motor area influences spinal motoneurons and accesses high-order somatosensory information through the unique convergence of long and short white matter fibres. Their findings offer insights into cortical motor control and better surgical planning.; Graphical Abstract

N2  -  Alexander disease is a rare disorder of the central nervous system with characteristic symmetric white matter abnormalities with frontal predominance on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Histopathology shows a lack of myelin in the affected white matter, variably interpreted as hypomyelination or demyelination. To increase our insight into the nature of the pathology leading to the MR imaging findings in Alexander disease, we applied serial MR imaging, spectroscopy, magnetization transfer (MT) imaging (MTI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in six patients with juvenile Alexander disease.
The MR imaging protocol comprised T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and MT ratio (MTR) maps were generated, and MR spectroscopy concentrations were quantified for several metabolites.; MR imaging showed similar cerebral white matter abnormalities in all patients, with only minor increase on prolonged follow-up, despite sometimes serious clinical progression. MR spectroscopy showed highly elevated levels of myo-inositol, lactate, and choline-containing compounds and decreased total N-acetyl-aspartate and N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate levels in the abnormal white matter. High values of ADC were observed, and both FA and MTR were attenuated.; The sequential MR imaging findings in Alexander disease provide strong evidence against active demyelination as sole explanation for the underlying pathology. An alternative explanation for our spectroscopic, DTI, and MTI findings-which would suggest demyelination-could be hyperplasia and hypertrophy of astrocytes, as seen in low grade gliomas.

N2  -  Chemical exchange saturated transfer (CEST) MRI has biomarker potential to assess tissue microenvironment in brain tumors. Multi-pool Lorentzian or spinlock models provides useful insights into the CEST contrast mecha-nism. However, T1 contribution to the complex overlapping effects of brain tumors is difficult under the non-equilibrium state. Therefore, this study evaluated T1 contributions on multi-pool parameters with quasi-steady-state (QUASS) algorithm reconstructed equilibrium data. MRI scans were performed in rat brain tumor models, including relaxation, diffusion, and CEST imaging. A pixel-wise seven-pool spinlock-model was employed to fit QUASS reconstructed CEST Z-spectra and evaluated the magnetization transfer (MT), amide, amine, guanidyl, and nuclear-overhauled effect (NOE) signals in tumor and normal tissues. In addition, T1 was estimated from the spinlock-model fitting and compared with measured T1. We observed tumor had a statistically significant increase in the amide signal (p < 0.001) and decreases in the MT and NOE signals (p < 0.001). On the other hand, the differences in amine and guanidyl between the tumor and contralateral normal regions were not statistically significant. The differences between measured and estimated T1 values were 8% in the normal tissue and 4% in the tumor. Furthermore, the isolated MT signal strongly correlated with R1 (r = 0.96, P < 0.001). In summary, we successfully unraveled multi-factorial effects in the CEST signal using spinlock-model fitting and QUASS method and demonstrated the effect of T1 relaxation on MT and NOE.

N2  -  To investigate the incompletely understood somatotopical organization of the corticospinal tract in the human brain-stem, we performed a voxel-based statistical analysis of standardized magnetic resonance scans of 41 prospectively recruited patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction caused by acute brainstem infarction. Motor hemiparesis was rated clinically and by the investigation of motor evoked potentials to arms and legs. Infarction affected the pons in 85 % of cases. We found the greatest level of significance of affected brainstem areas between the pontomesencephalic junction and the mid pons. Lesion location was significantly more dorsal in patients with hemiparesis affecting more proximal muscles and was significantly more ventral in patients with predominantly distal limb paresis. Comparison of magnetic resonance lesion from patients with paresis predominantly affecting arm or leg did not show significant topographical differences. We conclude that a topographical arm/leg distribution of corticospinal fibers is abruptly broken down as the descending corticospinal tract traverses the pons. Corticospinal fibers, however, follow a somatotopical order in the pons with fibers controlling proximal muscles being located close to the reticular formation in the dorsal pontine base, and thus more dorsal than the fibers controlling further distal muscle groups.

N2  -  Background: Changes in functional activity and connectivity have been shown in patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain. However, PHN-induced structural changes, particularly in the gray matter of which volume and density was widely reported to be altered by other chronic pain, have not been well characterized.
Objective: In this study, we aimed to detect the difference in the microstructure of gray matter of PHN patients as compared to the healthy controls, and to analyze the correlation between microstructural alterations and clinical features of PHN patients.; Study Design: Observational study.; Setting: University hospital.; Methods: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed in 19 patients with PHN and in 19 age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Maps of axial kurtosis (K), mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (K perpendicular to) in gray matter were calculated and compared between the 2 groups. Correlations between kurtosis metrics in the regions where between-group difference was detected and pain intensity as well as lesion duration were tested by Pearson's correlation.; Results: Compared with healthy controls, PHN patients exhibited significantly decreased DKI parameters in the bilateral insula and superior temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and occipital lobe, right cerebellum anterior lobe, right thalamus, caudate and parahippocampal gyrus. K in the bilateral insula and MK in the right insula were negatively correlated with visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of PHN patients, whereas no correlation was found between DKI parameters and lesion duration of PHN pain.; Limitation: Relatively small sample size. We still cannot determine the causal and effect relationship between the microstructural abnormalities in the gray matter and PHN.; Conclusions: DKI can specifically reflect pathophysiological microstructural alterations in the cerebral gray matters of PHN patients. This feature enables magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be a potentially valuable technique for objectively estimating the severity of PHN pain, which would provide an opportunity for elucidating the central mechanisms underlying PHN as well.

N2  -  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) vIII is a mutated EGFR that is frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas and implicated in response to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we investigate the effect of ZD6474 (ZACTIMA, vandetanib), a dual inhibitor for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and EGFR on growth and angiogenesis of gliomas expressing EGFRvIII. We used two glioma xenograft models, U87MG cells overexpressing EGFRvIII and short-term cultured primary glioma GBM8 cells with EGFRvIII. ZD6474 inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis and induced cell apoptosis in various brain gliomas. Moreover, significant inhibition of EGFRvIII-expressing U87MG and GBM8 gliomas was observed compared with their controls. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis using the apparent diffusion coefficient and three-dimensional T2*weighed measurements validated ZD6474 inhibition on tumor growth and angiogenesis in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM8 gliomas. Mechanistically, ZD6474 shows better inhibition of cell growth and survival of U87MG/EGFRvIII, GBM6, and GBM8 cells that express EGFRvIII than U87MG or GBM14 cells that have nondetectable EGFRvIII through attenuation of activated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, Akt, and Bcl-X-L expression. Albeit in lesser extent, ZD6474 also displays suppressions of U87MG/EGFR and GBM12 cells that overexpress wild-type EGFR. Additionally, ZD6474 inhibits activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in both types of cells, and expression of a constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinases partially rescued ZD6474 inhibition in U87MG/EGFRvIII cells. Taken together, these data show that ZD6474 significantly inhibited growth and angiogenesis of gliomas expressing EGFRvIII by specifically blocking EGFRvIII-activated signaling mediators, suggesting a potential application of ZD6474 in treatments for glioblastomas that overexpress EGFRvIII.

T2  -  WORLD NEUROSURGERY

N2  -  Brain mapping and connectomics can probe networks that span the entire brain, producing a diverse range of outputs for probing specific clinically relevant questions. The potential for understanding the effect of focal lesions on brain function, cognition, and plasticity abounds, any one of which would likely yield more effective and safer neurosurgical strategies. However, the possibilities of advanced magnetic resonance imaging and connectomics have been somewhat underused in neurosurgery, arising from actual or perceived difficulties in either application or analysis. The present review builds on previous work describing the theoretical attractions of connectomics to deliberate on the practical details of performing high-quality connectomics studies in neurosurgery. First, the data and methods involved in deriving connectomics models will be considered, specifically for the purpose of determining the nature of inferences that can be made subsequently. Next, a selection of key analysis methods will be explored using practical examples that illustrate their effective implementation and the insights that can be gleaned. The principles of study design will be introduced, including analysis tips and methods for making efficient use of available resources. Finally, a review of the best research practices for neuroimaging studies will be discussed, including principles of open access data sharing, study preregistration, and methods for improving replicability. Ultimately, we hope readers will be better placed to appraise the current connectomics studies in neurosurgery and empowered to develop their own high-quality studies, both of which are key steps in realizing the true potential of connectomics and advanced neuroimaging analyses in general.

N2  -  Connectome-based lesion symptom mapping (CLSM) can be used to relate disruptions of brain network connectivity with clinical measures. We present a novel method that extends current CLSM approaches by introducing a fast reliable and accurate way for computing disconnectomes, i.e. identifying damaged or lesioned connections. We introduce a new algorithm that finds the maximally disconnected subgraph containing regions and region pairs with the greatest shared connectivity loss. After normalizing a stroke patient's segmented MRI lesion into template space, probability weighted structural connectivity matrices are constructed from shortest paths found in white matter voxel graphs of 210 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Percent connectivity loss matrices are constructed by measuring the proportion of shortest-path probability weighted connections that are lost because of an intersection with the patient's lesion. Maximally disconnected subgraphs of the overall connectivity loss matrix are then derived using a computationally fast greedy algorithm that closely approximates the exact solution. We illustrate the approach in eleven stroke patients with hemiparesis by identifying expected disconnections of the corticospinal tract (CST) with cortical sensorimotor regions. Major disconnections are found in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and inferior parietal cortex. Moreover, the size of the maximally disconnected subgraph quantifies the extent of cortical disconnection and strongly correlates with multiple clinical measures. The methods provide a fast, reliable approach for both visualizing and quantifying the disconnected portion of a patient's structural connectome based on their routine clinical MRI, without reliance on concomitant diffusion weighted imaging. The method can be extended to large databases of stroke patients, multiple sclerosis or other diseases causing focal white matter injuries helping to better characterize clinically relevant white matter lesions and to identify biomarkers for the recovery potential of individual patients.

N2  -  Background: Ischemic stroke is one form of cancer-associated thrombosis that can greatly worsen a patient's performance status. The present investigation aimed to elucidate the characteristic distribution pattern(s) of cryptogenic stroke lesions using a voxel-based lesion-mapping technique and examine the differences in clinical manifestations between cryptogenic and conventional strokes in patients with advanced cancer. Methods: Data from 43 patients with advanced cancer who developed acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively collected. Stroke etiology was grouped into either cryptogenic or conventional stroke etiology according to the ASCO stroke score. Clinical data were reviewed, and voxel-based lesion mapping using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed to visualize the crosspatient spatial distribution of the lesions. Results: Of the 43 patients, 25 were classified as having cryptogenic stroke etiology and 18 were classified as having conventional stroke etiology. Median survival time of patients from stroke onset was 96 days for cryptogenic stroke etiology and 570 days for conventional stroke etiology (P = .01). D-dimer of patients was significantly higher in cryptogenic stoke etiology than in conventional stroke etiology (P = .006). Voxel-based lesion mapping showed that DWI hyperintense lesions accumulated at cortical and internal watershed areas of the cerebrum and at the vascular border zone of the superior cerebellar and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries at the cerebellum. Conclusions: Voxel-based lesion mapping for cryptogenic stroke in patients with advanced cancer showed that lesions accumulated at vascular border zones within the brain both at the cerebrum and at the cerebellum, but not at perforating arterial territories.

N2  -  Object. To validate the corticospinal tract (CST) illustrated by diffusion tensor imaging, the authors used tractography-integrated neuronavigation and direct fiber stimulation with monopolar electric currents.
Methods. Forty patients with brain lesions adjacent to the CST were studied. During the operation, the motor responses (motor evoked potential MEP) elicited at the hand by the cortical stimulation to the hand motor area were continuously monitored, maintaining the consistent stimulus intensity (mean 15.1 +- 2.21 mA). During lesion resection, direct fiber stimulation was applied to elicit MEP (referred to as fiber MEP) to identify the CST functionally. The threshold intensity for the fiber MEP was determined by searching for the best stimulus point and changing the stimulus intensity. The minimum distance between the resection border and illustrated CST was measured on postoperative isotropic images.; Results. Direct fiber stimulation demonstrated that tractography accurately reflected anatomical CST functioning. There were strong correlations between stimulus intensity for the fiber MEP and the distance between the CST and the stimulus points. The results indicate that the minimum stimulus intensity of 20, 15, 10, and 5 mA had stimulus points similar to 16, 13.2, 9.6, and 4.8 mm from the CST, respectively. The convergent calculation formulated 1.8 mA as the electrical threshold of the CST for the fiber MEP, which was much smaller than that of the hand motor area.; Conclusions. The investigators found that diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography is a reliable way to map the white matter connections in the entire brain in clinical and basic neuroscience applications. By combining these techniques, investigating the cortical-subcortical connections in the human CNS could contribute to elucidating the neural networks of the human brain and shed light on higher brain functions.

N2  -  BackgroundPurpose/HypothesisGerminal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is a common form of intracranial hemorrhage occurring in preterm neonates that may affect normal brain development. Although the primary lesion is easily identified on MRI by the presence of blood products, its exact extent may not be recognizable with conventional sequences. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) quantify the spatial distribution of magnetic susceptibility within biological tissues, including blood degradation products.
To evaluate magnetic susceptibility of normal-appearing white (WM) and gray matter regions in preterm neonates with and without GMH-IVH.; Study TypePopulationRetrospective case-control.; A total of 127 preterm neonates studied at term equivalent age: 20 had mild GMH-IVH (average gestational age 28.72.1 weeks), 15 had severe GMH-IVH (average gestational age 29.31.8 weeks), and 92 had normal brain MRI (average gestational age 29.81.8 weeks).; Field StrengthSequenceAssessmentQSM at 1.5 Tesla.; QSM analysis was performed for each brain hemisphere with a region of interest-based approach including five WM regions (centrum semiovale, frontal, parietal, temporal, and cerebellum), and a subcortical gray matter region (basal gangliathalami).; Statistical TestsResultsChanges in magnetic susceptibility were explored using a one-way analysis of covariance, according to GMH-IVH severity (P<0.05).; In preterm neonates with normal brain MRI, all white and subcortical gray matter regions had negative magnetic susceptibility values (diamagnetic). Neonates with severe GMH-IVH showed higher positive magnetic susceptibility values (i.e. paramagnetic) in the centrum semiovale (0.0019 versus -0.0014ppm; P<0.001), temporal WM (0.0011 versus -0.0012ppm; P=0.037), and parietal WM (0.0005 versus -0.0001ppm; P=0.002) compared with controls. No differences in magnetic susceptibility were observed between neonates with mild GMH-IVH and controls (P=0.236).; Data ConclusionParamagnetic susceptibility changes occur in several normal-appearing WM regions of neonates with severe GMH-IVH, likely related to the accumulation of hemosiderinferritin iron secondary to diffusion of extracellular hemoglobin from the ventricle into the periventricular WM.

N2  -  Single-Shot Echo Planar Imaging (SSEPI) based Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) has shortcomings such as low resolution and severe distortions. In contrast, Multi-Shot EPI (MSEPI) provides optimal spatial resolution but increases scan time. This study proposed a Multiple b-value mOdel-based Residual Network (MORN) model to reconstruct multiple b-value high-resolution DWI from undersampled k-space data simultaneously. We incorporated Parallel Imaging (PI) into a residual U-net to reconstruct multiple b-value multi-coil data with the supervision of MUltiplexed Sensitivity-Encoding (MUSE) reconstructed Multi-Shot DWI (MSDWI). Moreover, asymmetric concatenations among different b-values and the combined loss to back propagate helped the feature transfer. After training and validation of the MORN in a dataset of 32 healthy cases, additional assessments were performed on 6 patients with different tumor types. The experimental results demonstrated that the MORN model outperformed conventional PI reconstruction (i.e. SENSE) and two state-of-the-art deep learning methods (SENSE-GAN and VSNet) in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structual SIMilarity) and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. In addition, using the pre-trained model under DWI, the MORN achieved consistent fractional anisotrophy and mean diffusivity reconstructed from multiple diffusion directions. Hence, the proposed method shows potential in clinical application according to the observations on tumor patients as well as images of multiple diffusion directions.

N2  -  Deep-seated brain tumours represent a unique neurosurgical challenge as they are often surrounded by eloquent structures. We describe a minimally invasive technique using tubular retractors and intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring for open biopsy of a deep-seated lesion surrounded by the corticospinal tract. We used preoperative functional mapping with diffusion tensor imaging tractography and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation to identify a safe surgical corridor. We also used 5-Aminolevulinic Acid induced fluorescence to identify the lesion intraoperatively and optimize tissue samples obtained for histopathological diagnosis. We found the use of these tools improved the safety of surgery and reduced the risk of surgical morbidity.

N2  -  There is an expanding research interest in high-grade gliomas because of their significant population burden and poor survival despite the extensive standard multimodal treatment. One of the obstacles is the lack of individualized monitoring of tumor characteristics and treatment response before, during and after treatment. We have developed a two-stage semi-automatic method to co-register MRI scans at different time points before and after surgical and adjuvant treatment of high-grade gliomas. This two-stage co-registration includes a linear co-registration of the semi-automatically derived mask of the preoperative contrast-enhancing area or postoperative resection cavity, brain contour and ventricles between different time points. The resulting transformation matrix was then applied in a non-linear manner to co-register conventional contrast-enhanced T-1-weighted images. Targeted registration errors were calculated and compared with linear and non-linear co-registered images. Targeted registration errors were smaller for the semi-automatic non-linear co-registration compared with both the non-linear and linear co-registered images. This was further visualized using a three-dimensional structural similarity method. The semi-automatic non-linear co-registration allowed for optimal correction of the variable brain shift at different time points as evaluated by the minimal targeted registration error. This proposed method allows for the accurate evaluation of the treatment response, essential for the growing research area of brain tumor imaging and treatment response evaluation in large sets of patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gd-enhancement provides essential information in the assessment of brain tumors. However, enhancement does not always correlate with histology or disease activity, especially in the setting of current therapies. Our aim was to compare FDG-PET scans to ADC maps and Gd-enhanced MR images in patients with glial neoplasms to assess whether DWI might offer information not available on routine MR imaging sequences and whether such findings have prognostic significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective review, which was conducted in full compliance with HIPAA regulations. Twenty-one patients (11 men and 10 women) with glial tumors underwent FDG-PET and MR imaging, including ADC and Gd-enhancement. Subjectively, regions of interest were drawn around the following areas: 1) increased FDG uptake, 2) decreased signal intensity on ADC maps, and 3) Gd-enhancement. Objectively, FDG-PET and MR images were co-registered, and pixel-by-pixel comparison of ADC to PET values was made for all regions of interest. Correlation coefficients (r values) were calculated for each region of interest. Percentage overlap between regions of interest was calculated for each case.; RESULTS: Subjective evaluation showed 60% of patients with excellent or good correlation between ADC maps and FDG-PET. Pixel-by-pixel comparison demonstrated r values that ranged from -0.72 to -0.21. There was significantly greater overlap between decreased ADC and increased FDG-PET uptake (67.1 +- 15.5%) versus overlap between Gd-enhancement and increased FDG-PET uptake (54.4 +- 27.5%) (P < .05). ADC overlap was greater with increased FDG-PET than with Gd-enhancement in 89 cases. Survival data revealed that the presence of restricted diffusion on ADC correlated with patient survival (P < .0001).; CONCLUSIONS: ADC maps in patients with brain tumors provide unique information that is analogous to FDG-PET. There is a greater overlap between ADC and FDG-PET compared with Gd-enhancement. ADC maps can serve to approximate tumor grade and predict survival.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DWI by using higher b-values provides tissue diffusivity with less T2 shinethrough effect. VCD in the abscess cavity correlates with ADC values. The purpose of this study was to investigate which b-value-derived ADC correlates better with VCD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with brain abscess underwent conventional MR imaging and DWI with b = 1000, 2000, and 3000 smm(2) on a 3T MR imaging scanner. ADC values were quantified by placing regions of interest inside the abscess cavity in all sections where the lesion was apparent on coregistered ADC maps derived from different b-values. VCD was measured on pus aspirated.; RESULTS: An increase in b-value was associated with a decrease in ADC values in normal parenchyma as well as in the abscess cavity. The most significant negative correlation of VCD was observed with b = 3000 smm(2) (r = -0.98, P = .01).; CONCLUSIONS: VCD in the abscess cavity can be best assessed at b = 3000 smm(2) secondary to the reduction in the T2 shinethrough effect. DWI with b = 3000 smm(2) is of promising value in the assessment of the therapeutic response of brain abscess.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Silent ischemic events are known to occur during diagnostic and interventional endovascular procedures between 10% and 69% of the time. The occurrence of silent and symptomatic ischemic events in the surgically treated population is not known, although atherosclerotic changes of intracranial vessels or within the aneurysms wall or neck area are seen often during surgery.
Methods-Patients with unruptured and ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clipping were prospectively evaluated with MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging sequences before and within 24 hours after surgery. Patients were evaluated clinically before and after surgery. During surgery, the overall and maximal time of temporary occlusion as well as the total number of temporary and finally applied clips was noted. Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed with determination and characterization of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities.; Results-Thirty-six patients with 51 aneurysms were included. One symptomatic and 5 silent ischemic lesions were found in 5 patients. This represents a risk of silent ischemia of 9.8% per treated aneurysm and a risk of symptomatic stroke of 2%. The most significant risk factor in increasing order was: age (P<0.05), presence of thrombus (P<0.05), number of final clips applied (P<0.05), number of temporary clips used (P<0.01), total time of temporary clip occlusion (P<0.001), and maximal time of temporary occlusion (P<0.001).; Conclusions-The risk of silent and symptomatic ischemic events during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms seems to be low. Microsurgical clipping is safe and should continue to be strongly considered as a treatment option. (Stroke. 2009;40:129-133.)

N2  -  Brain imaging has a crucial role in the presurgical assessment of patients with epilepsy. Structural imaging reveals most cerebral lesions underlying focal epilepsy. Advances in MRI acquisitions including diffusion-weighted imaging, post-acquisition image processing techniques, and quantification of imaging data are increasing the accuracy of lesion detection. Functional MRI can be used to identify areas of the cortex that are essential for language, motor function, and memory, and tractography can reveal white matter tracts that are vital for these functions, thus reducing the risk of epilepsy surgery causing new morbidities. PET, SPECT, simultaneous EEG and functional MRI, and electrical and magnetic source imaging can be used to infer the localisation of epileptic foci and assist in the design of intracranial EEG recording strategies. Progress in semi-automated methods to register imaging data into a common space is enabling the creation of multimodal three-dimensional patient-specific datasets. These techniques show promise for the demonstration of the complex relations between normal and abnormal structural and functional data and could be used to direct precise intracranial navigation and surgery for individual patients.

N2  -  Lesions in the cerebellum produce various symptoms related to balance and motor coordination. However, the relationship between the exact topographical localization of a lesion and the resulting symptoms is not well understood in humans. In this study, we analyzed 66 consecutive patients with isolated cerebellar infarctions demonstrated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We identified the involved lobules in these patients using a cross-referencing tool of the picture archiving and communication system, and we investigated the relationships between the sites of the lesions and specific symptoms using chi (2) tests and logistic regression analysis. The most common symptoms in patients with isolated cerebellar infarctions were vertigo (87%) and lateropulsion (82%). Isolated vertigo or lateropulsion without any other symptoms was present in 38% of patients. On the other hand, limb ataxia was a presenting symptom in only 40% of the patients. Lateropulsion, vertigo, and nystagmus were more common in patients with a lesion in the caudal vermis. Logistic regression analysis showed that lesions in the posterior paravermis or nodulus were independently associated with lateropulsion. Lesions in the nodulus were associated with contralateral pulsion, and involvement of the culmen was associated with ipsilateral pulsion and isolated lateropulsion without vertigo. Nystagmus was associated with lesions in the pyramis lobule, while lesions of the anterior paravermis were associated with dysarthria and limb ataxia. Our results showed that the cerebellar lobules are responsible for producing specific symptoms in cerebellar stroke patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Asymmetry of the corticospinal tract in congenital lesions is a good prognostic marker for preserved motor function after hemispherectomy. This study aimed to assess this marker and provide a clinically feasible approach in selected cases of unilateral polymicrogyria. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Corticospinal tract asymmetry of 9 patients with unilateral polymicrogyria substantially affecting the central region was retrospectively assessed on axial T1WI and DTI. Volumes of the brain stem and thalamus and DTI parameters of the internal capsule were measured. Two neuroradiologists independently rated the right-left asymmetry at 4 levels along the corticospinal tract. DTI tractography was used to determine the motor cortex within polymicrogyria, with task-based functional MR imaging available in 3/9 cases. RESULTS:Visual assessment of the brain stem asymmetry showed excellent correlation with quantitative measures on both T1WI and color-coded DTI maps (P = .007 and P = .023). Interrater reliability regarding structural and DTI-based corticospinal tract asymmetry was best at the midbrain (Cohen = 0.77, P = .018). Three patients underwent functional hemispherectomy with postsurgical stable motor function, all showing marked corticospinal tract asymmetry preoperatively. Following the DTI-based corticospinal tract trajectories allowed identifying the presumed primary motor region within the dysplastic cortex in 9/9 patients, confirmed by functional MR imaging in 3/3 cases. CONCLUSIONS:Visual assessment of corticospinal tract asymmetry in unilateral polymicrogyria involving the motor cortex is most reliable with T1WI and color-coded DTI maps at the level of the midbrain. Pronounced asymmetry predicts preserved motor function after hemispherectomy. DTI-based tractography can be used as a guidance tool to the motor cortex within polymicrogyria.

N2  -  (1) Single nerve fibre action potentials (APs) of lower sacral nerve roots were recorded extracellularly with two pairs of wire electrodes during an operation in which an anterior root stimulator for bladder control was implanted in 9 humans with a spinal cord lesion and dyssynergia of the urinary bladder. Roots that were not saved and that were used to record from were later used for morphometry. (2) Nerve fibre groups were identified by conduction velocity distribution histograms of single afferent and efferent fibres and partly by nerve fibre diameter distribution histograms, and correlation analysis was performed. Group conduction velocity values were obtained additionally from compound action potentials (CAPs) evoked by electrical stimulation of nerve roots and the urinary bladder. (3) The group conduction velocities and group nerve fibre diameters had the following pair-values at 35.5 degrees C: Spindle afferents: SP1 (65 m/s/13.1 mu m), SP2 (51/12.1); touch afferents: T1 (47/11.1), T2 (39/10.1), T3 (27/9.1), T4 (19/8.1); urinary bladder afferents: S1 (41 m/s/-), ST (35/-); alpha-motoneurons: alpha(13) (-/14.4), alpha(12) (65m/s/13.1 mu m), alpha(11) (60?/12.1)(FF), alpha(2) (51/10.3)(FR), alpha(3) (41/8.2)(S); gamma-motoneurons: gamma(beta) (27/7.1), gamma(1) (21/6.6), gamma(21) (16/5.8), gamma(22) (14/5.1); preganglionic parasympathetic motoneurons: (10 m/s/3.7 mu m). (4) The values of group conduction velocity and group nerve fibre diameter measured in the paraplegics were very similar to those obtained earlier from brain-dead humans and patients with no spinal cord lesions. Also, the number and the density of myelinated fibres were preserved in the roots. Thus, the classification and identification of nerve fibre groups remained preserved following spinal cord lesion. A direct comparison can thus be made of natural impulse patterns of afferent and efferent nerve fibres between paraplegics (pathologic) and brain-dead humans (supraspinal destroyed CNS, in many respects physiologic). (5) When changing the root temperature from 32 degrees C to 35.5 degrees C, the group conduction velocities changed in the following way in one case: SP2: 40 m/s (32 degrees C) to 50 m/s (35.5 degrees C), S1: 31.3 to 40, ST: 25 to 33.8, M: 12.5 to 13.8; alpha(2): 40 to 50, alpha(3): 33 to 40. The group conduction velocities showed different temperature dependence apart from SP2 fibres and alpha(2)-motoneurons. (6) Upon retrograde bladder filling the urinary bladder stretch (S1) and tension receptor afferent (ST) activity levels were undulating and increased. As compared to activity levels detected in a brain-dead human, S1 (designates afferents, not cord segment) and ST afferents fired, even when the bladder was empty, with an activity level similar to that observed in a brain-dead human with the bladder half filled. Two reasons are brought forward for a too small storage volume of the urinary bladder in paraplegics: too high afferent activity of the bladder due to changed receptor field signal transduction mechanisms and too low compliance.

N2  -  Background. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), initially developed to provide an improved method for cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) venography, is now an integral part of neuroradiological diagnostics and is steadily gaining importance in non-cerebral imaging.
Principles. Tissue-inherent susceptibility differences generate a local magnetic field in which the dephasing of signal-producing protons occurs. This leads to a characteristic phase shift that can be used as a means to enhance contrast in the well-known T2*-weighted imaging.; Application in clinical routine. Many medically relevant pathologies induce tissue alterations that also influence the magnetic properties of tissue. Thus, the detection of blood residues and calcifications in SWI is superior to conventional MR sequences.; Future prospects. New techniques, such as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) allow improved differentiation between blood residues and calcifications and provide an alternative imaging method for fiber tractography with respect to diffusion tensor imaging.

N2  -  Background: Central nervous system tumors are usually located in the brain, and spinal cord tumors account for approximately 20% of central nervous system tumors. Epidermoid cysts constitute <1% of all intraspinal tumors. It consists of squamous epithelial-lined cysts containing keratin, cholesterol, and cellular granules. Epidermoid cysts can be classified as congenital, acquired, extradural, extramedullary, or intramedullary according to etiology and location. The intradural intramedullary type is uncommon.Case Presentation: An 11-year-old female patient had back pain with radiation to both lower extremities but worsened on the left side for 5 years. On neurological examination, motor strength was 3/5 for hip flexion and knee extension bilaterally and 5/5 for other key muscle groups. Contrast-enhanced lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesions in the L2-L4 intramedullary conus and cauda equina. Laminectomy and near total resection were done, and histopathological examination revealed an epidermoid cyst. On the third postoperative day, the patient was discharged with completely resolved back pain and an improvement in lower extremity motor power. At monthly follow-up visits for a further 6 months, her back pain and weakness completely resolved, and she had no neurologic deficits. A postoperative lumbosacral MRI was done and confirmed near total excision of the tumor.Conclusion: Intramedullary conus epidermoid cysts are rare but not unknown to neurosurgeons. MRI with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is an imaging modality of choice. Asymptomatic patients can be conservatively treated. Once the patient has progressive symptoms and signs of compression, surgical excision is recommended. Meticulous electrocauterization may help decrease tumor regrowth in the remnant capsule, which is recommended. Avoiding leakage of cyst fluid into the subarachnoid space helps to avoid postoperative chemical meningitis. Radiotherapy is an option for the management of multiple recurrences.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Thalamic gliomas represent a great challenge for neurosurgeons because of the high surgical risk of damaging the surrounding anatomy. Preoperative planning may considerably help the surgeon find the most ideal operative trajectory, avoiding thalamic nuclei and important white matter pathways adjacent to the tumor tissue. Thalamic segmentation is a promising imaging tool based on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. It provides the possibility to predict the relationship of the tumor to thalamic nuclei.
OBJECTIVE: To propose a new tool in thalamic glioma surgery that may help to differentiate between normal thalamus and tumor tissue, making preoperative planning possible and facilitating the choice of the optimal surgical approach and trajectory for neuronavigation-assisted surgery.; METHODS: Four patients with thalamic gliomas preoperatively underwent conventional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging conducted on 1.5 T. Subsequently, probabilistic tractography and thalamic segmentation were performed with the FSL Software as preoperative planning. We also present a case when thalamic segmentation was applied retrospectively using preoperative images. All patients went through neuronavigation-assisted surgery (1 partial, 4 subtotal resections).; RESULTS: Surgery performed based on the output of thalamic segmentation caused no deterioration in the neurological symptoms of our patients. Indeed, we noticed improvement in the neurological condition in 3 cases; furthermore, in 2 patients, a concern-free state was achieved.; CONCLUSION: We suggest that thalamic segmentation may be applied successfully and routinely in the surgical treatment of thalamic gliomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest a favorable benefit/risk ratio for insular glioma surgery. However, it remains unknown if this is also applicable in the learning period of this expertise. Moreover, little is known about the neuropsychological outcomes after resection of insular glioma.
OBJECTIVE: To report an initial experience of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutated insular glioma resection and to contribute to our knowledge of neuropsychological outcomes after insular glioma resection.; METHODS: A consecutive series of 12 patients operated on for an IDH-mutated insular glioma was retrospectively reviewed. Surgery was performed through a transopercular approach. In 10 of the 12 patients, brain mapping with electric stimulation in an awake patient guided the resection. The extent of resection was assessed by volumetric measures of postoperative fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging. Areas of postoperative ischemia were detected by diffusion imaging. Neurologic, neuropsychological, and professional outcomes were retrieved from medical files.; RESULTS: The median extent of resection was 94% (range, 80%-100%). None of the patients had permanent speech or motor deficits. Areas of ischemia were observed in 75% of patients. Neuropsychological evaluations showed slight deterioration regarding lexical abilities and verbal memory in patients with left-sided tumors. Patients' performances in cognitive flexibility also commonly declined, regardless of the tumor side. Eight of the 9 patients working at the time of the surgery were able to resume their professional activity.; CONCLUSIONS: Resecting insular glioma under brain mapping techniques is a safe option, even during the learning period. Patients should be informed about the risk of mild deterioration of lexical abilities and cognitive flexibility.

N2  -  This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of diffusion tensor-based arcuate fasciculus (AF) fibre navigation in combination with 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) intraoperative MRI (iMRI) for the resection of gliomas involving eloquent language fibre tracts (AF tracts). Twenty patients with AF tract-involved gliomas in the dominant hemisphere were prospectively enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups. The normal group included nine patients with preoperative intact language function, while the aphasia group consisted of 11 patients who presented with different levels of conduction aphasia. The AF tractography results were integrated into three-dimensional (3D) datasets used for neuronavigation, and their course was superimposed onto the surgical field during glioma resection. The iMRI was used to compensate for the effects of brain shift and to evaluate the extent of resection. Fibre tract visualisation provided a quick and intuitive overview of the displaced course of the AF in 3D space and the surgical field under a microscope. At a 3-month to 6-month follow-up, only two patients from the normal group suffered exacerbated language deficits due to tumour recurrence. Meanwhile, language function in all patients in the aphasia group had improved. Therefore, AF neuronavigation, combined with 1.5 T iMRI, is a feasible method of maximising resection and minimising language deficits when removing gliomas that involve the AF.

N2  -  To assess the relative performance of MRI T-2 relaxation and ADC mapping as potential biomarkers of neurotoxicity, a model of 3-nitropropionic acid (NP)-induced neurodegeneration in rats was employed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received NP (N = 20,16-20 mg/kg, ip or sc) or saline (N = 6, 2 ml/kg, ip) daily for 3 days. MRI was performed using a 7 Tsystem employing quantitative 12 and ADC mapping based on spin echo pulse sequence. All maps were skull stripped and co-registered and the changes were quantified using baseline subtraction and anatomical segmentation. Following the in vivo portion of the study, rat brains were histologically examined. Four NP-treated rats were considered responders based on their MRI and histology data. T-2 values always increased in the presence of toxicity, while ADC changes were bidirectional, decreasing in some lesion areas and increasing in others. In contrast to T-2 in some cases, ADC did not change. The effect sizes of T-2 and ADC signals suggestive of neurotoxicity were 2.64 and 1.66, respectively, and the variability of averaged T-2 values among anatomical regions was consistently lower than that for ADC. The histopathology data confirmed the presence of neurotoxicity, however, a more detailed assessment of the correlation of MRI with histology is needed. T-2 mapping provides more sensitive and specific information than ADC about changes in the rat brain thought to be associated with neurotoxicity due to a higher signal-to-noise ratio, better resolution, and unidirectional changes, and presents a better opportunity for biomarker development.

N2  -  Objective: To compare MRI using perfusion and diffusion techniques with 6-[F-18]-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-18-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) in the follow-up of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and to identify the best imaging parameter to differentiate patients with different prognosis.
Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, 12 patients with a pathology-proven diagnosis of LGG and MR (with perfusion and diffusion sequences) and a PET study during their follow-up were retrospectively included in our study. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps on MR studies and PET images were evaluated using a region of interest-based method. All patients were categorized as stable or as having progressive disease at 1-year follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation test and multivariate analysis of variance (p, 0.05).; Results: No significant correlations were found between PET parameters maximum tumour-to-controlateral normal brain ratio (TN-max) and tumour-to-striatum ratio and ADC or relative CBV values measured in both PET hotspot regions and areas of maximum signal alterations. TNmax demonstrated a good sensitivity (83%) and specificity (100%) for differentiating two subgroups of patients with different outcomes at 1-year-follow-up (p, 0.05).; Conclusion: Perfusion and diffusion MR images provide different information compared with F-18-FDOPA PET in LGGs during follow-up and therefore, they should be considered as complementary tools in the evaluation of these tumours. F-18-FDOPA PET showed a significant prognostic role in the follow-up of LGGs and appeared to be a better tool than MR advanced techniques for outcome prediction. These results need to be confirmed with longitudinal studies on a larger population.; Advances in knowledge: This is the first study that compared F-18-FDOPA PET with perfusion and diffusion MR in LGGs during follow-up. These preliminary results highlight the importance of a multimodality approach in this field and evidence a potential role for F-18-FDOPA PET to predict patients at risk for tumour progression.

N2  -  Purpose: It is often difficult to distinguish between embryonal and ependymal tumors using conventional MR imaging. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculated from diffusion-weighted images (DWI) has been widely used for diagnosis, but its usefulness for differential diagnosis between embryonal and ependymal tumors has not been determined yet. Both DWI properties and ADC values of these two types of tumor at regular and high b-values on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively reviewed.
Materials and methods: DWI at 3 T was acquired for 16 patients with embryonal tumors (including medulloblastoma, CNS embryonal tumors (NOS), and atypical teratoidrhabdoid tumor), and 7 patients with ependymal tumors (including ependymoma and anaplastic ependymoma). ADC was measured by manually placing multiple regions of interest (ROIs) on ADC maps corresponding to enhancing lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, both on standard (b-1000) and high (b-4000) b-value DWI. The minimum ADC (ADC-MIN) was calculated from several ROIs placed on each tumor. The relationship between tumor cell density and ADC-MIN was also investigated.; Results: Both at b-1000 and b-4000, ADC-MIN was significantly lower in embryonal tumors than in ependymal tumors. Embryonal tumors could be completely discriminated from ependymal tumors using both b-values, but ADC-MIN at b-4000 (t-value= -8.312, p < 0.001) was better than ADC-MIN at b-1000.; There was a stronger negative correlation between cell density and ADC-MIN at b-4000 (r(2)= 0.50, p < 0.001) than with ADC-MIN at b-1000 (r(2)= 0.41, p < 0.001).; Conclusion: Evaluating ADC-MIN at b-4000 would be a useful tool for distinguishing embryonal from ependymal tumors.

N2  -  MRI-based diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be challenging when pathology is not visually evident due to low image contrast or small lesion size. Computer-assisted analyses are able to detect lesions common in a specific patient population, but most techniques do not address clinically relevant individual pathologies resulting from the heterogeneous etiology of the disease. We propose a novel method to supplement the radiological inspection of TLE patients () providing patient-specific quantitative assessment.
Regions of interest are defined across the brain and volume, relaxometry, and diffusion features are extracted from them. Statistical comparisons between individual patients and a healthy control group () are performed on these features, identifying and visualizing significant differences through individual feature maps. Four maps are created per patient showing differences in intensity, asymmetry, and volume.; Detailed reports were generated per patient. Abnormal hippocampal intensity and volume differences were detected in all patients diagnosed with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Abnormal intensities in the temporal cortex were identified in patients with no MTS. A laterality score correctly distinguished left from right TLE in 12 out of 15 patients.; The proposed focus on subject-specific quantitative changes has the potential of improving the assessment of TLE patients using MRI techniques, possibly even redefining current imaging protocols for TLE.

N2  -  Purpose: To apply voxelwise analysis of diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) tractography and T2-weighted MR lesion measurements to characterize intrinsic damage to the brain white matter (WM) tracts and the relation of this damage to the presence and location of focal lesions among the main clinical phenotypes of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Brain dual-echo and DT MR images were obtained in 172 patients with MS (22 13% with clinically isolated syndromes CIS suggestive of MS, 51 30% with relapsing-remitting RR MS, 44 26% with secondary progressive MS, 20 12% with benign MS, 35 20% with primary progressive MS) and 46 healthy control subjects. Probability maps of the major brain WM tracts were produced. Between-group comparisons were assessed by using analysis of covariance.; Results: Compared with the healthy control subjects, the patients with CIS had signifi cantly increased (P<.001) mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the majority of WM tracts. The primary progressive MS group showed diffuse increases in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, with fractional anisotropy (FA) damage involving the majority of WM tracts. No relevant difference in diffusivity measures was found between the CIS and RR-MS groups. Compared with the benign MS group, the RR-MS group had reduced FA values in all WM tracts and decreased axial diffusivity in the majority of tracts. The secondary progressive MS group had pronounced damage to the majority of tracts and, compared with the benign MS group, pronounced FA alteration of the tracts relevant for motor impairment.; Conclusion: Voxelwise assessment of DT MR index abnormalities is a rewarding strategy for understanding the heterogeneity of clinical MS phenotypes.

N2  -  Cerebral palsy due to perinatal injury to cerebral white matter is usually not caused by genetic mutations, but by ischemia and/or inflammation. Here, we describe an autosomal-recessive type of tetraplegic cerebral palsy with mental retardation, reduction of cerebral white matter, and atrophy of the cerebellum in an inbred sibship. The phenotype was recorded and evolution followed for over 20 years. Brain lesions were studied by diffusion tensor MR tractography.
Homozygosity mapping with SNPs was performed for identification of the chromosomal locus for the disease. In the 14 Mb candidate region on chromosome 7q22, RNA expression profiling was used for selecting among the 203 genes in the area. In postmortem brain tissue available from one patient, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed. Disease course and imaging were mostly reminiscent of hypoxic-ischemic tetraplegic cerebral palsy, with neuroaxonal degeneration and white matter loss. In all five patients, a donor splice site pathogenic mutation in intron 14 of the AP4M1 gene (c.1137+1G -> T), was identified. AP4M1, encoding for the mu subunit of the adaptor protein complex-4, is involved in intracellular trafficking of glutamate receptors. Aberrant GluR delta 2 glutamate receptor localization and dendritic spine morphology were observed in the postmortem brain specimen. This disease entity, which we refer to as congenital spastic tetraplegia (CST), is therefore a genetic model for congenital cerebral palsy with evidence for neuroaxonal damage and glutamate receptor abnormality mimicking perinatally acquired hypoxic-ischemic white matter injury.

N2  -  Quantifying white matter damage in vivo is becoming increasingly important for investigating the effects of neuroprotective and repair strategies in multiple sclerosis (MS). While various approaches are available, the relationship between MRI-based metrics of white matter microstructure in the disease, that is, to what extent the metrics provide complementary versus redundant information, remains largely unexplored. We obtained four microstructural metrics from 123 MS patients: fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), myelin water fraction (MWF), and magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR). Coregistration of maps of these four indices allowed quantification of microstructural damage through voxel-wise damage scores relative to healthy tissue, as assessed in a group of 27 controls. We considered three white matter tissue-states, which were expected to vary in microstructural damage: normal appearing white matter (NAWM), T2-weighted hyperintense lesional tissue without T1-weighted hypointensity (T2L), and T1-weighted hypointense lesional tissue with corresponding T2-weighted hyperintensity (T1L). All MRI indices suggested significant damage in all three tissue-states, the greatest damage being in T1L. The correlations between indices ranged from r = 0.18 to r = 0.87. MWF was most sensitive when differentiating T2L from NAWM, while MTR was most sensitive when differentiating T1L from NAWM and from T2L. Combining the four metrics into one, through a principal component analysis, did not yield a measure more sensitive to damage than any single measure. Our findings suggest that the metrics are (at least partially) correlated with each other, but sensitive to the different aspects of pathology. Leveraging these differences could be beneficial in clinical trials testing the effects of therapeutic interventions.

N2  -  Objective Since astrocytes at the blood-brain barrier are targeted by neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), this study aims to assess whether patients with NMOSD have a subclinical accumulation of brain water and if it differs according to disease activity. Methods Seventy-seven aquaporin-4-positive patients with NMOSD and 105 healthy controls were enrolled at two European centres. Brain dual-echo turbo spin-echo MR images were evaluated and maps of T2 relaxation time (T2rt) in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), grey matter and basal ganglia were obtained. Patients with a clinical relapse within 1 month before or after MRI acquisition were defined 'active'. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using z-scores of T2rt obtained with age-adjusted and sex-adjusted linear models from each site. A stepwise binary logistic regression was run on clinical and MRI variables to identify independent predictors of disease activity. Results Patients had increased T2rt in both white and grey matter structures (p range: 0.014 to <0.0001). Twenty patients with NMOSD were defined active. Despite similar clinical and MRI features, active patients had a significantly increased T2rt in the NAWM and grey matter compared with those clinically stable (p range: 0.010-0.002). The stepwise binary logistic regression selected the NAWM as independently associated with disease activity (beta=2.06, SE=0.58, Nagelkerke R-2=0.46, p<0.001). Conclusions In line with the research hypothesis, patients with NMOSD have increased brain T2rt. The magnitude of this alteration might be useful for identifying those patients with active disease.

N2  -  Convergent experimental evidence points to the cerebellum as a key neural structure mediating adaptation to visual and proprioceptive perturbations. In a previous study, we have shown that activity in the anterior cerebellum varies with the rate of learning, with fast learners exhibiting more activity in this region than slow learners. Here, we investigated whether this variability in behavior may partly reflect inter-individual differences in the structural properties of cerebellar white-matter output tracts. For this purpose, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate fractional anisotropy (FA), and correlated the FA with the rate of adaptation to an optical rotation in 11 subjects. We found that FA in a region consistent with the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), containing fibers connecting the cerebellar cortex with motor and premotor cortex, was positively correlated with the rate of adaptation but not with the general level of performance or the initial deviation. The same pattern was observed in a region of the lateral posterior cerebellum. In contrast, FA in the angular gyrus of the posterior parietal cortex correlated positively both with the rate of adaptation and the overall level of performance. Our results show that the rate of learning a visuomotor task is associated with FA of cerebellar pathways. Hum Brain Mapp 30:4048-4053, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Mixed reports leave uncertainty about whether normalization of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to a within-subject white matter reference is necessary for assessment of tumor cellularity. We tested whether normalization improves the previously reported correlation of resection margin ADC with 15-month overall survival (OS) in HGG patients. Spin-echo echo-planar DWI was retrieved from 3 T MRI acquired between maximal resection and radiation in 37 adults with new-onset HGG (25 glioblastoma; 12 anaplastic astrocytoma). ADC maps were produced with the FSL DTIFIT tool (Oxford Centre for Functional MRI). 3 neuroradiologists manually selected regions of interest (ROI) in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and in non-enhancing tumor (NT) < 2 cm from the margin of residual enhancing tumor or resection cavity. Normalized ADC (nADC) was computed as the ratio of absolute NT ADC to NAWM ADC. Reproducibility of nADC and absolute ADC among the readers' ROI was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV). Correlations of ADC and nADC with OS were compared using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both mean ADC and nADC differed significantly between patients subgrouped by 15-month OS (p = 0.0014 and 0.0073 respectively). wCV and ICC among the readers were similar for absolute and normalized ADC. In ROC analysis of correlation with OS, nADC did not perform significantly better than absolute ADC. Normalization does not significantly improve the correlation of absolute ADC with OS in HGG, suggesting that normalization is not necessary for clinical or research ADC analysis in HGG patients.

N2  -  The majority of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit T-cell- and macrophage-dominated lesions (patterns I and II; as opposed to III and IV). These lesions, in turn, may be distinguished on the basis of whether or not there are immunoglobulin and complement depositions at the sites of active myelin destruction; such depositions are found exclusively in pattern II lesions. The main aim of this study was to determine whether pattern I and pattern II MS lesions exhibit distinct MRI signatures. We have used a recently described focal MOG-induced EAE model of the rat brain, which recapitulates many of the hallmarks of pattern II MS; we compared this with our previous work in a delayed type hypersensitivity model of a pattern I type lesion in the rat brain. Demyelinating lesions with extensive inflammation were generated, in which the T2-weighted signal was increased. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) maps revealed loss and subsequent incomplete recovery of the structure of the corpus callosum, together with changes in tissue water diffusion and an associated increase in ventricle size. Notably, the MTR changes preceeded histological demyelination and may report on the processes leading to demyelination, rather than demyelination per se. Immunohistochemically, these MRI-detectable signal changes correlated with both inflammatory cell infiltration and later loss of myelin. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and an increase in the regional cerebral blood volume were also evident in and around the lesion site at the early stage of the disease. Interestingly, however, the MRI signal changes in this pattern II type MS lesion were remarkably consistent with those previously observed in a pattern I lesion. These findings suggest that the observed signal changes reflect the convergent histopathology of the two models rather than the underlying mechanisms of the disease.

N2  -  Purpose Intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) is a valuable tool aiding paediatric brain tumour resection. There is no published evidence comparing the effectiveness of the final intraoperative MRI and early post-operative (24-72 h) MRI as baseline scans following brain tumour resection. We aimed to evaluate whether the final ioMRI scan could serve as the post-operative baseline scan after paediatric brain tumour resections. Methods This prospective study compared the final ioMRI scan with the immediate post-operative MRI scan performed 24-72 h post-surgery. We included 20 patients aged 6.6-21 years undergoing brain tumour resection using ioMRI and were suitable for MRI scan without general anaesthesia. The scans were independently evaluated by experienced local and external paediatric neuroradiologists. Identical sequences in the final ioMRI and the 24-72-h MRI were compared to assess the extent of resection, imaging characteristics of residual tumour, the surgical field, extent of surgically induced contrast enhancement, and diffusion abnormalities. Results In 20 patients undergoing intraoperative and early post-operative MRI, there was no difference between ioMRI and 24-72-h post-op scans in identifying residual tumour. Surgically induced contrast enhancement was similar in both groups. There were more abnormalities on diffusion imaging and a greater degree of oedema around the surgical cavity on the 24-72-h scan. Conclusion The final 3-T ioMRI scan may be used as a baseline post-operative scan provided standard imaging guidelines are followed and is evaluated jointly by the operating neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist. Advantages of final ioMRI as a baseline scan are identified.

N2  -  Cognitive deficits are a common and debilitating consequence of stroke, yet our understanding of the structural neurobiological biomarkers predicting recovery of cognition after stroke remains limited. In this longitudinal observational study, we set out to investigate the effect of both focal lesions and structural connectivity on poststroke cognition. Sixty-two patients with stroke underwent advanced brain imaging and cognitive assessment, utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), at 3-month and 12-month poststroke. We first evaluated the relationship between lesions and cognition at 3 months using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Next, a novel correlational tractography approach, using multi-shell diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected at both time points, was used to evaluate the relationship between the white matter connectome and cognition cross-sectionally at 3 months, and longitudinally (12 minus 3 months). Lesion-symptom mapping did not yield significant findings. In turn, correlational tractography analyses revealed positive associations between both MoCA and MMSE scores and bilateral cingulum and the corpus callosum, both cross-sectionally at the 3-month stage, and longitudinally. These results demonstrate that rather than focal neural structures, a consistent structural connectome underpins the performance of two frequently used cognitive screening tools, the MoCA and the MMSE, in people after stroke. This finding should encourage clinicians and researchers to not only suspect cognitive decline when lesions affect these tracts, but also to refine their investigation of novel approaches to differentially diagnosing pathology associated with cognitive decline, regardless of the aetiology.

N2  -  Object. The goal in this study was to highlight the potential of currently available imaging techniques for surgical planning of procedures in and around the limbic system.
Methods. The authors review traditional and newer imaging techniques as applied to neurosurgical planning. Today MR imaging techniques play a preponderant role. The various applications of functional techniques such as diffusion weighted, diffusion tensor, perfusion, and functional MR imaging methods are discussed.; Results. In addition to the high-resolution studies of anatomy that can be acquired, especially at higher field strengths (>= 3 T), MR imaging now also offers the possibility of acquiring functional, metabolic, hemodynamic, and molecular information on normal and pathological brain processes.; Conclusions. The knowledge obtained using the various imaging techniques contributes substantially to understanding the disease processes in a way that drastically improves surgical planning.

N2  -  Purpose Intraoperative T-2-weighted (T2-w) imaging unreliably captures image contrast specific to thermal ablation after transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery, impeding dynamic imaging feedback. Using a porcine thalamotomy model, we test the unproven hypothesis that intraoperative DWI can improve dynamic feedback by detecting lesioning within 30 minutes of transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery.
Methods Twenty-five thermal lesions were formed in six porcine models using a clinical transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery system. A novel diffusion-weighted pulse sequence monitored the formation of T2-w and diffusion-weighted lesion contrast after ablation. Using postoperative T2-w contrast to indicate lesioning, apparent intraoperative image contrasts and diffusion coefficients at each lesion site were computed as a function of time after ablation, observed peak temperature, and observed thermal dose. Lesion sizes segmented from imaging and thermometry were compared. Image reviewers estimated the time to emergence of lesion contrast. Intraoperative image contrasts were analyzed using receiver operator curves.; Results On average, the apparent diffusion coefficient at lesioned sites decreased within 5 minutes after ablation relative to control sites. In-plane lesion areas on intraoperative DWI varied from postoperative T2-w MRI and MR thermometry by 9.6 +- 9.7 mm(2) and -4.0 +- 7.1 mm(2), respectively. The 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 quantiles of the earliest times of observed T2-w and diffusion-weighted lesion contrast were 10.7, 21.0, and 27.8 minutes and 3.7, 8.6, and 11.8 minutes, respectively. The T2-w and diffusion-weighted contrasts and apparent diffusion coefficient values produced areas under the receiver operator curve of 0.66, 0.80, and 0.74, respectively.; Conclusion Intraoperative DWI can detect MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery lesion formation in the brain within several minutes after treatment.

N2  -  In adults, Brain Tumor (BT) is the deadliest disease. Thus, in the treatment of BTs, accurate detection and classification are essential. Many approaches are developed, but these previous approaches still have defects in accuracy and reliability and they only predict the tumor or tumor localization. So, a cumulative density function based bi-directional long short term memory network (CDF-BiLSTM) centered BT classification and severity level prediction is proposed. Primarily, by employing Suppressed Sobel Operator-Covariance Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SSO-CSRAD) techniques, noise in the input MRI image was removed. Next, by deploying Neighbourhood Function-based Texton Map Generation (NF-TMG) techniques, the tumor location was detected. Then, the tumor was segmented by using Gradient Operator-based Balloon Snake (GO-BS). Afterward, the features are extracted; also, the optimal features are selected by deploying Secant Wild Geese Migration Optimization (SWGMO). Then, the type of tumor was detected by utilizing CDF-BiLSTM. In the end, for each class, the severity prediction was determined. The experimental analysis was done, where the proposed model's efficiency is depicted.

N2  -  Objectives: To describe lesional diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics in a cohort of patients with biopsy-proven CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease (IDD) and compare diffusion characteristics of ring-enhancing CNS IDD lesions vs abscesses and tumors.
Methods: Forty prebiopsy apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reviewed from 30 patients with CNS IDD. Lesions were analyzed for size, T2-weighted (T2W) hypointense rim, enhancement, and ADC pattern. ADC patterns of CNS IDD ring-enhancing lesions were compared with a published cohort of 35 patients with ring-enhancing tumors and abscesses.; Results: IDD lesions displayed a spectrum of peripheral ADC patterns at the lesion edge: restricted diffusion (low ADC), 33%; increased diffusion (high ADC), 60%; and normal diffusion (homogeneously isointense), 7%. Of biopsied lesions, 93% enhanced (ring, 52%; heterogeneous, 34%; homogeneous, 7%). A hypointense T2W rim was observed in 53%. A ring pattern on ADC (isointense or dark) was associated with T2W hypointense rims (p = 0.02) but not with ring enhancement. On serial imaging, 4 of 7 (57%) patients demonstrated changes in ADC patterns. Peripheral restriction was more common in IDD (p = 0.006) than in tumors or abscesses, whereas central restriction was only observed in abscesses. Restricted lesions in the same stage were more common in the non-IDD cohort (42% vs 20%), with a uniform restricted pattern seen only in abscesses.; Conclusions: In ring-enhancing lesions, peripheral diffusion restriction is more common in IDD than in tumorsabscesses, whereas central restriction is more common among abscesses. Rapid ADC pattern changes in IDD probably reflect dynamic lesion evolution and may distinguish IDD from tumors. Neurology (R) 2012;78:1655-1662

N2  -  Purpose: To assess the diagnostic value of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in spontaneous intracranial abscesses compared with those occurring after primary neurosurgery.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective comparative study was approved by the local institutional review board. The requirement to obtain written informed consent was waived. A total of 73 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging from February 2005 to May 2015 were divided into two cohorts depending on whether the abscess was identified after a primary neurosurgical procedure (n = 43) or was a spontaneous abscess (n = 30). Abscesses were assessed for ADC by two readers independently. ADCs were described as medians with interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney and chi(2) tests were used to compare ADCs between the two cohorts, and chi(2) automatic interaction detection analysis was used to classify the ADCs into categories according to the cohorts.; Results: The median ADC of postoperative abscesses was 1.34 x 1023 mm(2)sec (interquartile range, 1.00-1.62 x 1023 mm(2)sec), which was significantly higher than the median ADC of spontaneous abscesses, 0.68 x 1023 mm(2)sec (interquartile range, 0.58-0.79 x 1023 mm(2)sec; P < .001). Twenty four (83%) of the abscesses with ADCs less than 0.79 x 1023 mm(2)sec were found to be spontaneous, while only six (27%) abscesses with ADCs between 0.79 and 1.33 x 1023 mm(2)sec and no abscesses with ADCs greater than 1.33 x 1023 mm(2)sec were spontaneous (P < .001).; Conclusion: Significantly higher ADCs were found in postoperative abscesses compared with those in spontaneous abscesses. Diffusion-weighted imaging with ADC mapping is not sufficient for excluding postoperative intracranial abscess and should not be used as the key diagnostic modality in this situation. (C) RSNA, 2016

N2  -  Purpose: To elucidate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values calculated from echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging (EPDWI) are useful in the differential diagnosis of ovarian cystic masses.
Materials and Methods: EPDWI was performed in 131 patients with ovarian cystic masses (54 mature cystic teratomas, 35 endometrial cysts, four other benign cysts, 14 benign neoplasms, and 24 malignant neoplasms). The areas of the highest signal intensity on EPDWI (b = 1000 secondsmm(2)) and the lowest ADC values within the cystic component were evaluated.; Results: On qualitative and quantitative analyses, mature cystic teratomas tended to show higher signal intensity and had areas of lower ADC values than endometrial cysts and other benign and malignant neoplasms (P <.005). In vitro scanning of the cystic contents of mature cystic teratomas confirmed that high signal on DWI or low ADC value was attributable to the keratinoid substance within the tumors. The difference in ADC between malignant and benign lesions were significant when mature cystic teratomas and endometrial cysts were included, but was not significant when they were excluded.; Conclusion: The ADC value may add useful information to the differential diagnosis of ovarian cystic masses in limited populations, such as those with mature cystic teratomas with a small amount of fat.

N2  -  Understanding the neurobiology and functional connectivity of hippocampal structures is essential for improving the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. At the macroscale, in vivo MRI often reveals hippocampal atrophy and decreased fractional anisotropy, whereas at the microscopic scale, there frequently is evidence of neuronal loss and gliosis. Mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus (DG), with evidence of glutamatergic synapses in the stratum moleculare (SM) putatively originating from granule cell neurons, may also be observed. This aberrant connection between the DG and SM could produce a reverberant excitatory circuit. However, this hypothesis cannot easily be evaluated using macroscopic or microscopic techniques. We here demonstrate that the ex vivo mesoscopic MRI of surgically excised hippocampi can bridge the explanatory and analytical gap between the macroand microscopic scale. Specifically, diffusion-and T-2-weighted MRI can be integrated to visualize a cytoarchitecture that is akin to immunohistochemistry. An appropriate spatial resolution to discern individual cell layers can then be established. Processing of diffusion tensor images using tractography detects extra-and intrahippocampal connections, hence providing a unique systems view of the hippocampus and its connected regions. Here, this approach suggests that there is indeed an aberrant connection between the DG and SM, supporting the sprouting hypothesis of a reverberant excitatory network. Mesoscopic ex vivo MR imaging hence provides an exciting new avenue to study hippocampi from treatment-resistant patients and allows exploration of existing hypotheses, as well as the development of new treatment strategies based on these novel insights.

N2  -  Objective: To assess the correlation between cognitive impairment and overall vs regional CNS damage, quantified using conventional and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography in multiple sclerosis (MS).
Methods: Brain dual-echo, T1-weighted, and DT MRI data were acquired from 82 patients with MS. DT tractography was used to produce maps of white matter (WM) tracts involved in cognition. The sensory thalamocortical projections and optic radiations were studied as "control" WM tracts. The contribution of global brain damage (T2 lesion volume, normalized brain volume, gray matter GM volume, WM volume, DT MRI measures of normal-appearing WM and GM damage) and damage to selected WM tracts to overall cognitive impairment and to impairment at individual neuropsychological tests was assessed using a random forest (RF) analysis.; Results: Thirty-three patients had cognitive impairment. The majority of MRI measures differed significantly between cognitively impaired and cognitively preserved (CP) patients. Significant correlations were found between performance in the majority of neuropsychological tests and global or regional brain damage (r ranging from -0.60 to 0.57). The RF analysis showed a high performance in classifying cognitively impaired vs CP patients, with a classification (C)-index = 76.8%, as well as in classifying patients' impairment in individual neuropsychological tests (C-index between 75.6% and 86.6%). Measures of lesional damage in cognitive-related tracts, rather than measures of normal-appearing WM damage in the same tracts or global brainWMGM damage, resulted in the highest classification accuracy.; Conclusions: Lesions in strategic brain WM tracts contribute to cognitive impairment in MS through a multisystem disconnection syndrome.

N2  -  Objective: We used the result of monitoring to evaluate patients with post-operative neurological deficits attributable to hemodynamic cerebral ischemia owing to cross-clamping of the carotid artery.
Methods: We evaluated 131 carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures performed on 118 patients, 96 men and 22 women ranging in age from 38 to 82 years ( mean: 67.1 years). For monitoring, we used a combination of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), functional dynamic electroencephalography ( EEG), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transcranial Doppler (TCD). Patients who awoke with neurological deficits after CEA immediately underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).; Results: In 30 of the 131 procedures (22.9%), intraoperative monitoring disclosed abnormalities after cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery (ICA). In two of these 30 patients, shunt was not introduced, because of full recovery of monitoring after blood pressure increasing, however, one patient demonstrated transient ischemic attack (TIA). In six of remaining 28 patients who need shunt, transient hemodynamic cerebral ischemia occurred, however, all patients recovered gradually within 18 hours after CEA. No new lesions were detected on post-operative DWI of the seven patients and MRA demonstrated good patency of the carotid artery. The other 101 patients whose intraoperative monitoring after cross-clamping of the ICA did not disclose abnormalities demonstrated no hemodynamic TIA.; Conclusion Hemodynamic ischemia owing to cross-clamping of the ICA is rare in patients treated by CEA. However, in patients manifesting neurological deficits upon awakening from CEA, DWI and MRA should be performed immediately to facilitate their prompt treatment.

N2  -  In multiple sclerosis (MS), white matter damage is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction, which is especially prominent in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). While studies in healthy subjects have revealed patterns of correlated fractional anisotropy (FA) across white matter tracts, little is known about the underlying patterns of white matter damage in MS. In the present study, we aimed to map the SPMS-related covariance patterns of microstructuralwhite matter changes, and investigatedwhether or not these patterns were associatedwith cognitive dysfunction.
Diffusion MRI was acquired from 30 SPMS patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). A tensor model was fitted and FA mapswere processed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in order to obtain a skeletonised map for each subject. The skeletonised FA maps of patients only were decomposed into 18 spatially independent components (ICs) using independent component analysis. Comprehensive cognitive assessment was conducted to evaluate five cognitive domains. Correlations between cognitive performance and (1) severity of FA abnormalities of the extracted ICs (i. e. z-scores relative to FA values of HC) and (2) IC load (i.e. FA covariance of a particular IC) were examined.; SPMS patients showed lower FA values of all examined patterns of correlated FA (i. e. spatially independent components) than HC (p < 0.01). Tracts visually assigned to the supratentorial commissural class were most severely damaged (z = -3.54; p < 0.001). Reduced FA was significantly correlated with reduced IC load (i. e. FA covariance) (r= 0.441; p < 0.05). Lowermean FA and component load of the supratentorial projection tracts and limbic association tracts classes were associated with worse cognitive function, including executive function, working memory and verbal memory.; Despite the presence of white matter damage, itwas possible to reveal patterns of FA covariance across SPMS patients. This could indicate thatwhite matter tracts belonging to the same cluster, and thuswith similar characteristics, tend to follow similar trends during neurodegeneration. Furthermore, these underlying FA patterns might help to explain cognitive dysfunction in SPMS. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  We provide historical and scientific guidance on imaging response assessment for incorporation into clinical trials to stimulate effective and expedited drug development for recurrent glioblastoma by addressing 3 fundamental questions: (i) What is the current validation status of imaging response assessment, and when are we confident assessing response using today's technology? (ii) What imaging technology and/or response assessment paradigms can be validated and implemented soon, and how will these technologies provide benefit? (iii) Which imaging technologies need extensive testing, and how can they be prospectively validated? Assessment of T1 +/- contrast, T2/FLAIR, diffusion, and perfusion-imaging sequences are routine and provide important insight into underlying tumor activity. Nonetheless, utility of these data within and across patients, as well as across institutions, are limited by challenges in quantifying measurements accurately and lack of consistent and standardized image acquisition parameters. Currently, there exists a critical need to generate guidelines optimizing and standardizing MRI sequences for neuro-oncology patients. Additionally, more accurate differentiation of confounding factors (pseudoprogression or pseudoresponse) may be valuable. Although promising, diffusion MRI, perfusion MRI, MR spectroscopy, and amino acid PET require extensive standardization and validation. Finally, additional techniques to enhance response assessment, such as digital T1 subtraction maps, warrant further investigation.

N2  -  Background: The concepts of the representation of visual field in primary visual cortex are based on studies of war wounds and correlations with brain imaging in small cohorts. Because of the difficulty of judging brain lesion extent and the small number of studied patients, there is lingering controversy as to whether the central 15 degrees of visual field are mapped onto the posterior 25% of primary visual cortex or onto a larger area. To improve the delineation of MRI lesion extent, we have studied only patients with posterior cerebral artery (PCA) ischemic strokes. Methods: We accrued a cohort of 92 patients with PCA strokes from an electronic medical records search between 2009 and 2020 at a single tertiary care academic institution. Patients had reliable static perimetry demonstrating homonymous hemianopias and high-definition reviewable brain imaging. We divided the primary visual cortex on the MRI T1 sagittal sequence into 8 equal segments in right and left cerebral hemispheres and located lesions according to the segments they occupied. We correlated lesion locations with 3 visual field defects (VFDs): macular-sparing homonymous quadrantanopias, macular-splitting homonymous quadrantanopias, and homonymous paracentral scotomas. Results: Among 25 cases with macular sparing, 13 had lesion-sparing confined to the posterior 25% of visual cortex. Among 6 cases with homonymous paracentral scotomas, 2 had lesions confined to the posterior 25% of visual cortex. Macular-splitting quadrantanopia did not occur in any patients with lesions confined to the posterior 25% of visual cortex, but did occur in 3 patients with lesions confined to the posterior 50% of visual cortex. These phenomena would not be expected if the central 15 degrees of visual field were mapped onto a region extending beyond the posterior 25% of visual cortex. In patients with PCA strokes that involved the retrogeniculate visual pathway proximal to visual cortex, the visual cortex lesions were often less extensive than predicted by the VFDs, perhaps because of widespread damage to axons before they reached their destination in visual cortex. Conclusions: These results support the concept that the central 15 degrees of the visual field are represented in the posterior 25% of visual cortex. Although this study contributes a larger cohort of patients with better-defined lesion borders than in past reports, its conclusions must be tempered by the variability of patient attention during visual field testing, the subjectivity in the interpretation of the defect patterns, and the difficulty in judging MRI lesion extent even on diffusion-weighted and precontrast T1 sagittal sequences.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Information in multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (mpMR) images is relatable to voxel-level tumor response to Radiation Treatment (RT). We have investigated a deep learning framework to predict (i) post-treatment mpMR images from pre-treatment mpMR images and the dose map ( " forward models " ), and, (ii) the RT dose map that will produce prescribed changes within the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) on post-treatment mpMR images ( " inverse model " ), in Breast Cancer Metastases to the Brain (BCMB) treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS). Materials and methods: Local outcomes, planning computed tomography (CT) images, dose maps, and pretreatment and post-treatment Apparent Diffusion Coefficient of water (ADC) maps, T1-weighted unenhanced (T1w) and contrast-enhanced (T1wCE), T2-weighted (T2w) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) mpMR images were curated from 39 BCMB patients. mpMR images were co-registered to the planning CT and intensity-calibrated. A 2D pix2pix architecture was used to train 5 forward models (ADC, T2w, FLAIR, T1w, T1wCE) and 1 inverse model on 1940 slices from 18 BCMB patients, and tested on 437 slices from another 9 BCMB patients. Results: Root Mean Square Percent Error (RMSPE) within the GTV between predicted and ground-truth post-RT images for the 5 forward models, in 136 test slices containing GTV, were (mean +/- SD) 0.12 +/- 0.044 (ADC), 0.14 +/- 0.066 (T2w), 0.08 +/- 0.038 (T1w), 0.13 +/- 0.058 (T1wCE), and 0.09 +/- 0.056 (FLAIR). RMSPE within the GTV on the same 136 test slices, between the predicted and ground-truth dose maps, was 0.37 +/- 0.20 for the inverse model. Conclusions: A deep learning-based approach for radiologic outcome-optimized dose planning in SRS of BCMB has been demonstrated.

N2  -  DTI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging using T1-mapping with flip angles of 2 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees, followed by a 0.1-mmol/kg body weight gadolinium-based bolus was performed on 41 patients in addition to standard MR imaging. Permeability data were processed and transfer constant from the blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space, rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space back into blood plasma, extracellular extravascular volume fraction, and fractional blood plasma volume were calculated from 3D tumor volumes. Apparent diffusion coefficient histogram metrics were calculated. Wilcoxon tests showed a higher transfer constant from blood plasma into extracellular extravascular space and rate constant from extracellular extravascular space back into blood plasma, and lower extracellular extravascular volume fraction in high-grade tumors. The mean ADCs of FLAIR and enhancing tumor volumes were significantly lower in high-grade tumors. The authors conclude that ADC histogram metrics combined with permeability metrics differentiate low- and high-grade pediatric brain tumors with high accuracy.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate tumor grading is essential for treatment planning of pediatric brain tumors. We hypothesized that multiparametric analyses of a combination of permeability metrics and ADC histogram metrics would differentiate high- and low-grade tumors with high accuracy.; MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging using T1-mapping with flip angles of 2 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees, followed by a 0.1-mmolkg body weight gadolinium-based bolus was performed on all patients in addition to standard MR imaging. Permeability data were processed and transfer constant from the blood plasma into the extracellular extravascular space, rate constant from the extracellular extravascular space back into blood plasma, extravascular extracellular volume fraction, and fractional blood plasma volume were calculated from 3D tumor volumes. Apparent diffusion coefficient histogram metrics were calculated for 3 separate tumor volumes derived from T2-FLAIR sequences, T1 contrast-enhanced sequences, and permeability maps, respectively.; RESULTS: Results from 41 patients (0.3-16.76 years of age; mean, 6.22 years) with newly diagnosed contrast-enhancing brain tumors (16 low-grade; 25 high-grade) were included in the institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis. Wilcoxon tests showed a higher transfer constant from blood plasma into extracellular extravascular space and rate constant from extracellular extravascular space back into blood plasma, and lower extracellular extravascular volume fraction (P < .001) in high-grade tumors. The mean ADCs of FLAIR and enhancing tumor volumes were significantly lower in high-grade tumors (P < .001). ROC analysis showed that a combination of extravascular volume fraction and mean ADC of FLAIR volume differentiated high- and low-grade tumors with high accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.918).; CONCLUSIONS: ADC histogram metrics combined with permeability metrics differentiate low- and high-grade pediatric brain tumors with high accuracy.

N2  -  Purpose Mapping the ischaemic penumbra in acute stroke is of considerable clinical interest. For this purpose, mapping tissue hypoxia with F-18-misonidazole (FMISO) PET is attractive, and is straightforward compared to O-15 PET. Given the current emphasis on penumbra imaging using diffusion/perfusion MR or CT perfusion, investigating the relationships between FMISO uptake and abnormalities with these modalities is important.
Methods According to a prospective design, three patients (age 54-81 years; admission NIH stroke scale scores 16-22) with an anterior circulation stroke and extensive penumbra on CT- or MR-based perfusion imaging successfully completed FMISO PET, diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography 6-26 h after stroke onset, and follow-up FLAIR to map the final infarction. All had persistent proximal occlusion and a poor outcome despite thrombolysis. Significant FMISO trapping was defined voxel-wise relative to ten age-matched controls and mapped onto coregistered maps of the penumbra and irreversibly damaged ischaemic core.; Results FMISO trapping was present in all patients (volume range 18-119 ml) and overlapped mainly with the penumbra but also with the core in each patient. There was a significant (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001) correlation in the expected direction between FMISO uptake and perfusion, with a sharp FMISO uptake bend around the expected penumbra threshold.; Conclusion FMISO uptake had the expected overlap with the penumbra and relationship with local perfusion. However, consistent with recent animal data, our study suggests FMISO trapping may not be specific to the penumbra. If confirmed in larger samples, this preliminary finding would have potential implications for the clinical application of FMISO PET in acute ischaemic stroke.

N2  -  Glioma is the primary tumor in the central nervous system, and poses one of the greatest challenges in clinical treatment. MIB-1 and p53 are the most useful biomarkers for gliomas and could help neurosurgeons establish a therapeutic schedule. However, these biomarkers are commonly detected with the help of immunohistochemistry (IHC), which wastes time and energy and is often influenced by subjective factors. To reduce the subjective factors and improve the efficiency in the judgment of IHC, a novel magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis method is proposed in the present study to detect the expression status of MIB-1 and p53 in IHC. The proposed method includes two kinds of MRI acquisition (FLAIR and T1 FLAIR images), regions of interest (ROIs) selection, texture features (i.e. the gray level gradient co-occurrence matrix (GLGCM), Minkowski functions (MFs), etc) extraction in ROIs, and classification with a support vector machine in a leave-one-out cross validation strategy. By classifying the ROIs, the performance of the method was evaluated by accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), etc. A high accuracy (0.7640 +/- 0.0225) and AUC (0.7873 +/- 0.0377) for MIB-I detection were achieved. In terms of the texture features, 0.7621 +/- 0.0199, 0.7666 +/- 0.0365 and 0.7426 +/- 0.0451 AUC can be obtained using only GLCM, RLM or GLGCM for MIB-1 detection, respectively. In all, the experimental results demonstrated that MR image texture features are associated with the expression status of MIB-1 and p53. The proposed method has the potential to realize high accuracy and robust detection for MIB-I expression status, which makes it promising for clinical glioma diagnosis and prognosis.

N2  -  [3H]Forskolin and [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate have been used to map the adenylate cyclase and phosphatidylinositol systems respectively in brain slices by light-microscopic autoradiography. [3H]Forskolin binding to brain sections is displaced potently by forskolin (KD .apprxeq. 15 nM) and is enhanced by fluoride and GTP analogs, agents which activate the stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, Gs. Highest [3H]forskolin binding occurs in the corpus striatum, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and molecular layer of the cerebellum. Lesion studies demonstrate that binding sites in the substantia nigra are associated with striatal afferents, while hippocampal sites are localized to granule cell dendrites and mossy fiber terminals, and the intense binding in the cerebellar molecular layer is largely associated with granule cell axons and terminals. Protein kinase C mediates the activity of hormones and neurotransmitters, which act through the phosphatidylinositol cycle, and is labeled with high affinity by [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. At many synapses, maps of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase C reveal reciprocal distributions, which may have implications for second messenger regulation of synaptic transmission.

N2  -  Presurgical mapping in a pediatric patient diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation in the left hemisphere revealed a case of apparent functional reorganization of a white matter tract. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to identify the motor fields following hand movement. As expected, motor field activity for the left hand was detected in the right hemisphere. Surprisingly, MEG activity was also detected in the right hemisphere following movement of the right hand. MEG activations served as seeds from which to launch diffusion tensor imaging tractography to delineate the corticospinal tracts (CSTs). Using the MEG activation for movement of the right hand, we delineated a tract in the right hemisphere. A tract corresponding to motor function for the left hand was also delineated in the right hemisphere. For comparison, the CSTs of the patient were launched from anatomical landmarks at the precentral gyrus, and were successfully delineated in each hemisphere. Our findings suggest that the functional delineation of white matter pathways may be more sensitive than anatomical delineation for identifying reorganization of the developing brain in response to a lesion. This study is, to our knowledge, the first description of a functional reorganization of an existing tract to serve as a CST in children.

N2  -  Drug-resistant epileptic patients account for 40 % of cases of epilepsy. Consequently, specific therapeutic options could be surgical resection or, if not indicated, deep brain stimulation (DBS). The aim of this study is to review data from patients affected by drug-resistant complex partial epilepsy with or without generalization treated by anterior thalamic nucleus (AN) DBS to evaluate the efficacy and potential future applications of this approach as a standard method for palliative seizure control.
Six patients affected by drug-resistant complex partial seizures underwent AN DBS from March 2007 to February 2011. The preoperative tests consisted of electroencephalography (EEG), video EEG, morphologic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-acute positron emission tomography (PET), neuropsychological evaluation, Liverpool seizure scale, and Quality Of Life In Epilepsy (QOLIE). These tests and a seizure diary were also administered during a follow-up of at least 3 years.; The improvement in terms of decrease of seizures was more than 50 % in patients affected by complex partial seizures strictly related to limbic system origin. The amelioration was unsatisfactory for patients having anatomical lesions outside the limbic structures with evidence of late diffusion in limbic areas. One patient died 40 days after surgery for reasons not concerned with DBS.; Although the limited number of enrolled patients limits the reliability of data, the results are in accordance with those found in the recent literature and deserve to be considered for further studies regarding real efficacy, indications, stimulation parameters, side effects, and complications.

N2  -  Objective: To clarify the clinical usefulness of preoperative fibre-tracking in affected pyramidal tracts for intraoperative monitoring during the removal of brain tumours from patients with motor weakness.
Methods: We operated on 10 patients with mild to moderate motor weakness caused by brain tumours located near the pyramidal tracts under local anaesthesia. Before surgery, we performed fibre-tracking imaging of the pyramidal tracts and then transferred this information to the neuronavigation system. During removal of the tumour, motor function was evaluated with motor evoked potentials elicited by corticalsubcortical electrical stimulation and with voluntary movement.; Results: In eight patients, the locations of the pyramidal tracts were estimated preoperatively by fibre-tracking; motor evoked potentials were elicited on the motor cortex and subcortex close to the predicted pyramidal tracts. In the remaining two patients, in which fibre-tracking of the pyramidal tracts revealed their disruption surrounding the tumour, corticalsubcortical electrical stimulation did not elicit responses clinically sufficient to monitor motor function. In all cases, voluntary movement with mild to moderate motor weakness was extensively evaluated during surgery and was successfully preserved postoperatively with appropriate tumour resection.; Conclusions: Preoperative fibre-tracking could predict the clinical usefulness of intraoperative electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and subcortical fibres (ie, pyramidal tracts) to preserve affected motor function during removal of brain tumours. In patients for whom fibre-tracking failed preoperatively, awake surgery is more appropriate to evaluate and preserve moderately impaired muscle strength.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to measure involvement of normal-appearing white matter (WM) immediately adjacent to multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques and thus redefine actual plaque size on diffusion-tensor images through comparison with T2-weighted images of equvilent areas in healthy volunteers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was not required given the retrospective nature of the study on an anonymized database. The study complied with requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Twelve patients with MS (four men, eight women; mean age, 35 years) and 14 healthy volunteers (six men, eight women; mean age, 25 years) were studied. The authors obtained fractional anisotropy (FA) values in MS plaques and in the adjacent normal-appearing WM in patients with MS and in equivalent areas in healthy volunteers. They placed regions of interest (ROIs) around the periphery of plaques and defined the total ROIs (ie, plaques plus peripheral ROIs) as abnormal if their mean FA values were at least 2 standard deviations below those of equivalent ROls within equivalent regions in healthy volunteers. The combined area of the plaque and the peripheral ROI was compared with the area of the plaque seen on T2-weighted MR images by means of a Student paired t test (P = .05).; RESULTS: The mean plaque size on T2-weighted images was 72 21 (standard deviation). The mean plaque FA value was 0.285 +- 0.088 (0.447 +- 0.069 in healthy volunteers P < .001; mean percentage reduction in FA in MS plaques, 37%). The mean plaque size on FA maps was 91 mm(2) +- 35, a mean increase of 127% compared with the size of the original plaque on T2-weighted images (P = .03).; CONCLUSION: A significant increase in plaque size was seen when normal-appearing WM was interrogated with diffusion-tensor MR imaging. This imaging technique may represent a more sensitive method of assessing disease burden and may have a future role in determining disease burden and activity. (c) RSNA, 2005

N2  -  Noninvasive neuroimaging aids in surgical planning and in counseling patients about possible risks of surgery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) performs the most common types of surgical planning that the neurosurgeon faces, including localization of epileptic discharges, determination of the hemispheric dominance of verbal processing, and the ability to locate eloquent cortex. MEG is most useful when it is combined with structural imaging, most commonly with structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR diffusion imaging. This article reviews the history of clinical MEG, introduces the basic concepts about the biophysics of MEG, and outlines the basic neurosurgical applications of MEG.

N2  -  Glioblastomas (GBM), one of the most common tumors of the central nervous system, are associated with poor prognosis, even with all the scientific development of the last decades. Individual survival, however, is not homogenous among GBM patients, and multiple factors are related to their outcome, including age, biological characteristics of the tumor, and extent of treatment. Extent of resection (EOR) plays a major role as an independent modifiable factor associated with improved overall and progression-free survival. Achievement of maximal safe resection, removing as much as possible the tumor while preserving the neurological function, is the main goal of the current surgical treatment of GBM. To reach this objective, different technologies and surgical techniques have been introduced in neuro-oncology surgery, including functional neuronavigation systems, ultrasound surgery, intraoperative MRI scan, and intraoperative cortical and subcortical mapping techniques. In the current manuscript, we examine the impact of EOR on the prognosis of GBM patients and the benefits and limitations of modern adjuvant techniques used for resection of these lesions.

N2  -  Purpose: MR-imaging hallmarks of glioblastoma (GB), cerebral lymphoma (CL), and demyelinating lesions are gadolinium (Gd) uptake due to blood-brain barrier disruption. Thus, initial diagnosis may be difficult based on conventional Gd-enhanced MRI alone. Here, the added value of a dynamic texture parameter analysis (DTPA) in the differentiation between these three entities is examined. DTPA is an in-house software tool that incorporates the analysis of quantitative texture parameters extracted from dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE) images.
Methods: Twelve patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 15 patients with GB, and five patients with CL were included. The image analysis method focuses on the DSCE image time series during bolus passage. Three time intervals were examined: inflow, outflow, and reperfusion time interval. Texture maps were computed. From the DSCE image series, mean, difference, standard deviation, and variance texture parameters were calculated and statistically analyzed and compared between the pathologies.; Results: The texture parameters of the original DSCE image series for mean, standard deviation, and variance showed the most significant differences (P-value between <0.00 and 0.05) between pathologies. Further, the texture parameters related to the standard deviation or variance (both associated with tissue heterogeneity) revealed the strongest discriminations between the pathologies.; Conclusion: We conclude that dynamic perfusion texture parameters as assessed by the DTPA method allow discriminating MS, GB, and CL lesions during the first passage of contrast. DTPA used in combination with classification algorithms has the potential to find the most likely diagnosis given a postulated differential diagnosis.

N2  -  Purpose: The objective of the study was to evaluate the maps of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and diffusion-weighted (DW) images in demonstrating meningoencephalitic lesions in children. Materials and methods: Between May 1998 and May 2000, 18 infants and children (4.5-190 months old) suffering from meningoencephalitis were included in the study. The diagnoses were bacterial meningoencephalitis in 8 and aseptic or viral in 10 patients. All 18 patients had brain MRI examinations. In the axial plane, three pulse sequences were performed on all patients: (1) FSE T2W images; (2) fast FLAIR images; (3) single-shot echoplanar DW images were acquired. Another 18 patients from the control group also received DW image examination. ADCs were computed for all regions on each DW image. Results: The absolute values of CNRs of lesions on T2W (7.27 +/- 5.51), FLAIR (5.56 +/- 5.03) and DW (13.36 +/- 16.64) images were significantly greater than those on ADC maps (0.42 +/- 0.30) in the study group of patients (P<.01). In addition, absolute CNRs on DW images were significantly greater than on T2W and FLAIR images (P<.01). However, lesions on ADC maps in the study group have significantly greater CNRs than in the control group (0.13 +/- 0.12) (P<.01). CNRs on initial DW images from patients with atrophy or swelling of meningoencephalitic lesions were significantly different from the CNRs of those patients without significant changes in meningoencephalitic lesions (P=.02 less than or equal to.05). Conclusion: The DW image is a sensitive tool for detecting meningoencephalitic lesions and is better than FSE T2W and fast FLAIR images in CNRs. Diffusion MR techniques provides new ways to possibly predict the outcome of intracranial infectious diseases in children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Preservation of cranial nerves (CNs) is of paramount concern in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, particularly in large tumors with thinned and distorted CN fibers. However, imaging of the CN fibers surrounding vestibular schwannomas has been limited with 2-dimensional imaging alone.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether tractography of the CN combined with anatomic magnetic resonance imaging of the tumor can provide superior 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of tumorCN complexes.; METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, including diffusion tensor imaging and anatomic images, were analyzed in 3 subjects with vestibular schwannomas using 3D Slicer software. The diffusion tensor images were used to track the courses of trigeminal, abducens, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerves. The anatomic images were used to model the 3D volume reconstruction of the tumor. The 2 sets of images were then superimposed through the use of linear registration.; RESULTS: Combined 3D tumor modeling and CN tractography can effectively and consistently reconstruct the 3D spatial relationship of CNtumor complexes and allows superior visualization compared with 2-dimensional imaging. Lateral and superior distortion of the trigeminal nerve was observed in all cases. The position of the facial nerve was primarily anteriorly and inferiorly. The gasserian ganglion and early postganglionic branches could also be visualized.; CONCLUSION: Tractography and anatomic imaging were successfully combined to demonstrate the precise location of surrounding CN fibers. This technique can be useful in both neuronavigation and radiosurgical planning. Because knowledge of the course of these fibers is of important clinical interest, implementation of this technique may help decrease injury to CNs during treatment of these lesions.

N2  -  Background: Myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome typically manifests in adults younger than 40 years with encephalopathy, stroke-like episodes, and lactic acidosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities typically involve the cortical gray and the adjacent subcortical white matter.
Objective: To describe a 58-year-old woman diagnosed with MELAS who was initially seen with acute myopathy, cardiac ischemia, psychosis, and MRI changes in a watershed distribution.; Results: Initial MRI of the brain showed the characteristic parieto-occipital gray matter lesions involving the adjacent white matter. Follow-up MRI revealed striking deep white matter involvement in a watershed distribution. A cerebral angiogram and thorough hypercoagulable workup results were normal. Electromyography showed acute denervation and myopathy. A muscle biopsy specimen revealed ragged red and cytochrome-c oxidase-negative fibers. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed an A3243G mutation.; Conclusions: Myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes should be considered in older patients with myopathy, cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, and unaccountable MRI findings. Watershed pathologic features are a rare pattern of cerebral involvement in MELAS.

N2  -  Objectives: We report a 61-year-old woman who developed left hemiparesis following a right frontal stroke. She underwent rehabilitation and regained function of the left side of her body. Three years after her first stroke, she developed a large left subdural hematoma and again presented with left hemiparesis. Materials and Methods: Prior to the cranioplasty, an fMRI scan involving left and right hand movement, arm movement, and foot peddling were conducted in order to determine whether the patient showed ipsilateral activation for the motor tasks, thus explaining the left hemiparesis following the left subdural hematoma. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was also collected to visualize the motor and sensory tracts. Results: The fMRI results revealed activation in the expected contralateral left primary motor cortex (M1) for the right-sided motor tasks, and bilateral M1 activation for the left-sided motor tasks. Intraoperative neurophysiology confirmed these findings, whereby electromyography revealed left-sided (i.e., ipsilateral) responses for four of the five electrode locations. The DTI results indicated that the corticospinal tracts and spinothalamic tracts were within normal limits and showed no displacement or disorganization. Conclusions: These results suggest that there may have been reorganization of the M1 following her initial stroke, and that the left hemisphere may have become involved in moving the left side of the body thereby leading to left hemiparesis following the left subdural hematoma. The findings suggest that cortical reorganization may occur in stroke patients recovering from hemiparesis, and specifically, that components of motor processing subserved byM1 may be taken over by ipsilateral regions.

N2  -  Object. There is continuous interest in the monitoring of language function during tumor resection around the frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere. The aim of this study was to visualize language-related subcortical connections, such as the arcuate fasciculus (AF) by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography.
Methods. Twenty-two patients with brain lesions adjacent to the AF in the frontotemporal regions of the dominant hemisphere were studied. The AF tractography was accomplished by placing initiation and termination sites (seed and target points) in the frontal and temporal regions, which were functionally identified by using functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging in conjunction with a verb generation task and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with a reading task. The combination of fMR imaging and MEG data clearly demonstrated the hemispheric dominance of language functions, which was confirmed by an intracranial amobarbital. test (Wada procedure). In all 22 patients, the authors were able to consistently visualize the AF by DT imaging-based tractography, using the functionally identified seed and target points and a fractional anisotropy value of 0.16. In two of 22 cases investigated, the functional information, including the results of AF tractography, fMR imaging, and MEG, was imported to a neuronavigation system and was validated by bipolar electric stimulation of the cortical and subcortical areas during awake surgery. The cortical stimulation to the gyrus that included the area of activation identified in fMR imaging with the language task evoked speech arrest, while the subcortical stimulation close to the AF reproducibly caused paranomia without speech arrest. Postoperative AF tractography showed that the distances between the stimulus points and the AF were within 6 mm.; Conclusions. The combination of these techniques facilitated accurate identification of the location of the AF and verification of the language fibers.

N2  -  Objectives Hypoxia is associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in breast cancer. However, the temporally variant nature of hypoxia can complicate interpretation of imaging findings. We explored the relationship between hypoxia and vascular function in breast tumours through combined(18)F-fluoromisonidazole (F-18-FMISO) PET/MRI, with simultaneous assessment circumventing the effect of temporal variation in hypoxia and perfusion. Methods Women with histologically confirmed, primary breast cancer underwent a simultaneous(18)F-FMISO-PET/MR examination. Tumour hypoxia was assessed using influx rate constantK(i)and hypoxic fractions (%HF), while parameters of vascular function (K-trans,k(ep),v(e),v(p)) and cellularity (ADC) were derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, respectively. Additional correlates included histological subtype, grade and size. Relationships between imaging variables were assessed using Pearson correlation (r). Results Twenty-nine women with 32 lesions were assessed. Hypoxic fractions > 1% were observed in 6/32 (19%) cancers, while 18/32 (56%) tumours showed a %HF of zero. The presence of hypoxia in lesions was independent of histological subtype or grade. Mean tumourK(trans)correlated negatively withK(i)(r = - 0.38,p = 0.04) and %HF (r = - 0.33,p = 0.04), though parametric maps exhibited intratumoural heterogeneity with hypoxic regions colocalising with both hypo- and hyperperfused areas. No correlation was observed between ADC and DCE-MRI or PET parameters. %HF correlated positively with lesion size (r = 0.63,p = 0.001). Conclusion Hypoxia measured by(18)F-FMISO-PET correlated negatively withK(trans)from DCE-MRI, supporting the hypothesis of perfusion-driven hypoxia in breast cancer. Intratumoural hypoxia-perfusion relationships were heterogeneous, suggesting that combined assessment may be needed for disease characterisation, which could be achieved using simultaneous multimodality imaging.

N2  -  Purpose To develop a simultaneous T-1, T-2, and ADC mapping method that provides co-registered, distortion-free images and enables multiparametric quantification of 3D brain coverage in a clinically feasible scan time with the MR Multitasking framework. Methods The T-1/T-2/diffusion weighting was generated by a series of T-2 preparations and diffusion preparations. The underlying multidimensional image containing 3 spatial dimensions, 1 T-1 weighting dimension, 1 T-2-preparation duration dimension, 1 b-value dimension, and 1 diffusion direction dimension was modeled as a 5-way low-rank tensor. A separate real-time low-rank model incorporating time-resolved phase correction was also used to compensate for both inter-shot and intra-shot phase inconsistency induced by physiological motion. The proposed method was validated on both phantom and 16 healthy subjects. The quantification of T-1/T-2/ADC was evaluated for each case. Three post-surgery brain tumor patients were scanned for demonstration of clinical feasibility. Results Multitasking T-1/T-2/ADC maps were perfectly co-registered and free from image distortion. Phantom studies showed substantial quantitative agreement (R2=0.999) with reference protocols for T-1/T-2/ADC. In vivo studies showed nonsignificant T-1 (P = .248), T-2 (P = .97), ADC (P = .328) differences among the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Although Multitasking showed significant differences of T-1 (P = .03), T-2 (P < .001), and ADC (P = .001) biases against the references, the mean bias estimates were small (Delta T-1% < 5%, Delta T-2% < 7%, Delta ADC% < 5%), with all intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.82 indicating "excellent" agreement. Patient studies showed that Multitasking T-1/T-2/ADC maps were consistent with the clinical qualitative images. Conclusion The Multitasking approach simultaneously quantifies T-1/T-2/ADC with substantial agreement with the references and is promising for clinical applications.

N2  -  [H-3](R)alpha-methylhistamine, a selective histamine H-3-receptor ligand, was used to perform binding studies with membranes and generate light microscopic autoradiograms in sections of the rat brain.
High densities of H-3 receptors were found in membranes from the anterior part of the cerebral cortex, the accumbens nucleus, the striatum, the olfactory tubercles and the substantia nigra. Autoradiography of sagittal and frontal sections evidenced specific labelling in a number of gray matter areas over a very low background, as determined using thioperamide, a selective H-3-receptor antagonist, as competing drug. Labelled areas were identified by comparison with adjacent Nissl-stained sections and their labelling was rated visually.; H-3 receptors are heterogeneously distributed among areas known to receive histaminergic projections. In the cerebral cortex, H-3 receptors are present in all areas and layers, with a rostrocaudal gradient and a higher density in deep layers (laminae IV-VI). In the hippocampal formation, H-3 receptors are the most abundant in the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. In the amygdaloid complex, the highest densities are found in the central, lateral and basolateral groups of nuclei. In the basal forebrain, the accumbens nucleus, the striatum, the olfactory tubercles and the globus pallidus are highly labelled. In the thalamus in which histaminergic fibres are scarce, H-3 receptors are present in a rather high density, particularly in the midline, median and intralaminar groups of nuclei. In the hypothalamus, where the densest network of histaminergic fibres is found, H-3 receptors occur in moderate density, being slightly more abundant in the anterior and medial part. They are also present at the level of the tuberomammillary nuclei where they may reside on histaminergic perikarya. In mesencephalon and lower brainstem, H-3 receptors are abundant in the reticular part of the substantia nigra and central gray. They are present in low density in areas of noradrenergic and serotoninergic perikarya and in the spinal cord, where a faint specific labelling is detected in the gray matter, particularly in the external layers of the dorsal horn. In the cerebellum and pituitary gland, H-3 receptors are scarce.; Kainic acid infusions into the striatum were followed by marked local decreases in H-3 receptors evidenced in both membrane binding and autoradiographic studies. Unilateral interruption of the ascending histaminergic pathways via electrocoagulation of the lateral hypothalamic area was followed by ipsilateral increase in striatal H-3(R)alpha-methylhistamine binding, a process consistent with denervation up regulation of postsynaptic H-3 receptors.; These lesion data, taken together with the differences observed between the regional distribution of H-3 receptors and that of histaminergic axons, indicate that these receptors are more abundant on target cells than on histaminergic neurons where they act as autoreceptors.

N2  -  Purpose: To quantify the repeatability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.
Materials and Methods: IRB approval and informed consent were obtained for this Health Insurance portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. Sixteen patients with glioblastoma multiforme underwent MR imaging at two time points without interval intervention. ADC and FA maps were registered to the contrast-enhanced and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image volumes. Volumes of tumor-related enhancement (TRE) and FLAIR signal abnormality (FSA) were defined using a semiautomated segmentation technique.; Results: Repeated observations of mean ADC and mean FA were highly consistent within both TRE (ADC: r = 0.947,P < 0.0001; FA: r = 0.947, P < 0.0001) and FSA (ADC: r = 0.979, P< 0.0001; FA: r = 0.972, P< 0.0001). Within TRE. repeatability coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for change measured 0.104 x 10(-3) mm(2)S(-1) and 7.4% (ADC) and 0.0196 and 13.9% (FA). respectively. Within FSA, repeatability coefficients and 95% Cl for change measured 0.071 x 10(-3) mm(2)S(-1) and 5.2% (ADC) and 0.0159 and 8.7% (FA), respectively. To detect 10% changes in mean ADC, sample sizes of nine (TRE) and six (FSA) patients would be required. The same change in mean FA would require sample sizes of 21 (TRE) and 10 (FSA) patients, respectively.; Conclusion: Changes after therapy greater than the repeatability coefficient or 95% Cl for change are unlikely to be related to variability in the measurement of ADC and FA.

N2  -  Background. In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, picture naming engages widely distributed brain regions in the parietal, frontal, and temporal cortices. However, it remains unknown whether those activated areas, along with white matter pathways between them, are actually crucial for naming. Objective. We aimed to identify nodes and pathways implicated in naming in healthy older adults and test the impact of lesions to the connectome on naming ability. Methods. We first identified 24 cortical nodes activated by a naming task and reconstructed anatomical connections between these nodes using probabilistic tractography in healthy adults. We then used structural scans and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps in 45 patients with left hemisphere stroke to assess the relationships of node and pathway integrity to naming, phonology, and nonverbal semantic ability. Results. We found that mean FA values in 13 left hemisphere white matter tracts within the dorsal and ventral streams and 1 interhemispheric tract significantly related to naming scores after controlling for lesion size and demographic factors. In contrast, lesion loads in the cortical nodes were not related to naming performance after controlling for the same variables. Among the identified tracts, the integrity of 4 left hemisphere ventral stream tracts related to nonverbal semantic processing and 1 left hemisphere dorsal stream tract related to phonological processing. Conclusions. Our findings reveal white matter structures vital for naming and its subprocesses. These findings demonstrate the value of multimodal methods that integrate functional imaging, structural connectivity, and lesion data to understand relationships between brain networks and behavior.

N2  -  Background: Intraoperative blood vessel detection based on intraluminal indocyanin-green (ICG) would allow to minimize the risk of blood vessel perforation during stereotactic brain tumor biopsy. For a fiber-based approach compatible with clinical conditions, the maximum tolerable excitation light power was derived from simulations of the thermal heat load on the tissue.
Methods: Using the simulation software LITCIT, the temperature distribution in human brain tissue was calculated as a function of time for realistic single-fiber probes (0.72 mm active diameter, numerical aperture 0.35, optional focusing to 0.29 mm diameter) and for the optimum ICG excitation wavelength of 785 nm. The asymptotic maximum temperature in the simulated tissue region was derived for different radiant fluxes at the distal fiber end. Worst case values were assumed for all other parameters. In addition to homogeneous (normal and tumor) brain tissue with homogeneous blood perfusion, models with localized extra blood vessels incorporated ahead of the distal fiber end were investigated.; Results: If one demands that destruction of normal brain tissue must be excluded by limiting the tissue heating to 42 C, then the radiant flux at the distal fiber end must be limited to 33 mW with and 43 mW without focusing. When considering extra blood vessels of 0.1 mm diameter incorporated into homogeneously perfused brain tissue, the tolerable radiant flux is reduced to 22 mW with and 32 mW without focusing. The threshold value according to legal laser safety regulations for human skin tissue is 28.5 mW.; Conclusions: For the envisaged modality of blood vessel application-relevant fiber configuration were determined with present legal regulations for skin tissue.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate neural substrates underlying attention deficit in patients with chronic subcortical stroke by combining voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and diffusion-tensor (DT) tractography.
Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were prospectively acquired from August 1, 2014, to March 30, 2015, in 49 patients (32 men, 17 women; mean age, 55.7 years +- 8.0; age range, 40-71 years) with subcortical infarctions in the basal ganglia and neighboring regions and 52 control subjects (30 men, 22 women; mean age, 54.4 years +- 7.5; age range, 40-68 years). A modified version of the attention network test was used to assess visual attention function. On the basis of the lesion map at the acute stage, VLSM was used to identify lesion locations related to attention deficit in patients with stroke. DT tractography then was used to determine the responsible impaired connections by using diffusion data at the chronic stage (>6 months after stroke).; Results: When compared with control subjects, patients with chronic stroke exhibited prolonged reaction time (RT) of correct responses (P=.009). VLSM revealed that acute stroke lesion in the right caudate nucleus and nearby white matter (found in seven patients) was correlated with the prolonged RT (P<.05). DTT showed that the responsible lesion was located in the right thalamic-and caudate-prefrontal pathways in control subjects. The subgroup with right-sided brain damage had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in these pathways (P<.001), which were correlated with the prolonged RT (P=.009 for the thalamic-prefrontal pathway, P<.001 for the caudate-prefrontal pathway).; Conclusion: Thalamic-prefrontal and caudate-prefrontal pathways impaired by stroke lesions appear to underlie attention deficit in patients with subcortical stroke in the right hemisphere.

N2  -  Neuronavigation has become an ubiquitous tool in the surgical management of brain tumors. This review describes the use and limitations of current neuronavigational systems for brain tumor biopsy and resection. Methods for integrating intraoperative imaging into neuronavigational datasets developed to address the diminishing accuracy of positional information that occurs over the course of brain tumor resection are discussed. In addition, the process of integration of functional MRI and tractography into navigational models is reviewed. Finally, emerging concepts and future challenges relating to the development and implementation of experimental imaging technologies in the navigational environment are explored.

N2  -  We describe a method to extract data from multispectral MR exams of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The technique produces images of "spectral phase" (SP) relative to a reference tissue. SP images allow retrospective suppression of signal in the reference tissue, while maintaining high spatial resolution. Image quality in SP images was determined from MR exams of 5 MS patients selected at random from a clinical trial underway at our institute. Exams consisting of proton density weighted (PDw), T2 weighted (T2w), T1 weighted (T1w), and gadolinium-DTPA enhanced T1w (GAD) images were acquired from each patient. The MR exams were corrected for intensity nonuniformity. then filtered with an algorithm based upon anisotropic diffusion, to reduce noise, Principal component (PC) images and SP images relative to cerebrospinal fluid (SPCSF), normal appearing white matter (SPNAWM). gray matter (SPGM), and temporalis muscle (SPMUS) were then calculated. Contrast between tissues and MS lesions in the MR and derived images was then determined by measuring the signal-difference-to-noise ratio (dSNR) between tissues. Our new SP images provided better tissue contrast than the original MR, filtered MR, and PC images. Contrast improved between CSF and NAWM (from 19.5 to 56), CSF and GM (from 15 to 36), GM and NAWM (from 8 to 14), MS lesions and CSF (from 16 to 35), and between MS lesions and NAWM (from 24 to 47). (Maximum contrast in the original MR images compared to maximum contrast in the SP images.) The additional contrast in SP images may aid the quantification and analysis of lesion activity in MR exams of MS patients. (C) 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

N2  -  This study aims to describe the role of open surgical treatment for focal brainstem gliomas (FBSGs) with the assistance of multimodal neuronavigation and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM) in children to investigate the efficacy of microsurgical treatment in pediatric FBSGs. Also the prognostic factors related to the overall survival (OS) of FBSGs to describe the patient and tumor characteristics relevant to prognosis/outcome were focused on. Clinical data of 63 pediatric patients below 16 years of age with FBSGs admitted to the Neurosurgical Unit of Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2012 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent initial surgical treatment, followed by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neuronavigation and IOM. Gross or near total resection (GTR or NTR) was achieved in 57/63 (90.5%) cases, and subtotal resection (STR) was achieved in 6/63 (9.5%) cases. Postoperative adjuvant therapy was received by 27/63 (42.9%) cases. Postoperative pathological examination revealed that 36/63 (57.1%) cases had grade I gliomas, 22/63 (34.9%) had grade II, and 5/63 (8.0%) had grade III-IV gliomas according to the WHO classification. The mean Karnofsky score preoperatively was 60, and at the time of follow-up was 90. Consecutively, 6 cases demonstrated disease progression, and 5 of these were deceased. The OS in all patients was 81.2% at 5 years. Histological grade (P < .001) and age at diagnosis (P = .023) showed significant association with prolonged OS. Multimodal neuronavigation and IOM allow very precise intracranial surgery, contributing to a maximally safe resection that might decrease the postoperative disability and mortality rate. This study also showed that pediatric FBSGs were mostly low-grade tumors with excellent surgical outcomes. Consequently, it is suggested that microsurgery can be used to treat FBSGs in children in order to provide better prognosis and survival outcomes.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively determine which diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique (ie, conventional diffusion-weighted MR imaging [b = 1000 or 1500 sec/mm(2)] or fluid-inversion prepared diffusion [FLIPD] MR imaging [b = 1500 sec/mm(2)]) is most accurate in depicting acute ischemic stroke at 3 T.
Materials and Methods: The Health Research Ethics Board approved this study; written informed consent was provided by all participants or their surrogate. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was performed in 75 consecutive patients (43 men, 32 women; mean age, 64.0 years) with acute ischemic stroke. Two experienced neuroradiologists determined the presence of hyperacute stroke lesions at diffusion-weighted MR imaging by locating areas of hyperintensity that corresponded to regions with a decreased diffusion coefficient. These findings were used as the reference standard. Four raters who were blinded to patient history assessed all images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps for the presence of changes that were consistent with acute ischemic stroke. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and inter- and intrarater reliability scores were calculated for each technique.; Results: Specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy were not significantly different among the techniques. FLIPD MR images obtained with a b value of 1500 secmm(2) had decreased sensitivity for acute ischemic stroke (mean, 61.8%; 95% confidence interval CI: 55.4%, 67.9%) compared with conventional diffusion-weighted MR images obtained with a b value of either 1000 secmm(2) (mean, 82.5%; 95% CI: 77.1%, 87.0%) or 1500 secmm(2) (mean, 84.5%; 95% CI: 79.3%, 88.9%).; Conclusion: FLIPD MR images also had decreased negative predictive value (mean, 96.5%; 95% CI: 95.7%, 97.2%) compared with conventional diffusion-weighted MR images obtained with a b value of either 1000 secmm(2) (mean, 98.4%; 95% CI: 97.8%, 98.8%) or 1500 secmm(2) (mean, 98.6%; 95% CI: 98.1%, 99.0%). Intra- and interrater reliability scores were generally excellent for all three techniques. FLIPD MR images obtained with a b value of 1500 secmm(2) are less suitable for the detection of acute ischemic stroke owing to a decreased sensitivity and negative predictive value. The performance of the two conventional diffusion-weighted MR imaging techniques (b = 1000 and 1500 secmm(2)) was equivalent. (c) RSNA, 2006.

N2  -  Simple Summary The most frequent brain tumors in children are solid tumors. A significant fraction of pediatric brain tumors is represented by gliomas, which are heterogeneous. Diffusion kurtosis imaging metrics (MK, AK, RK, FA, and ADC) have shown promising results for glioma grading in adult patients; however, it is unclear whether this technique is accurate for diagnosing high grade pediatric gliomas and if it is correlated with patient survival. In our study, we performed a retrospective whole-tumor analysis on 59 children affected by gliomas and tested (1) if DKI metrics are accurate for grading pediatric gliomas and (2) if DKI metrics are correlated with patient overall survival and progression-free survival. Purpose: To develop a predictive grading model based on diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics in children affected by gliomas, and to investigate the clinical impact of the predictive model by correlating with overall survival and progression-free survival. Materials and methods: 59 patients with a histological diagnosis of glioma were retrospectively studied (33 M, 26 F, median age 7.2 years). Patients were studied on a 3T scanner with a standardized MR protocol, including conventional and DKI sequences. Mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), radial kurtosis (RK), fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained. Whole tumour volumes (VOIs) were segmented semi-automatically. Mean DKI values were calculated for each metric. The quantitative values from DKI-derived metrics were used to develop a predictive grading model to develop a probability prediction of a high-grade glioma (pHGG). Three models were tested: DTI-based, DKI-based, and combined (DTI and DKI). The grading accuracy of the resulting probabilities was tested with a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis for each model. In order to account for dataset imbalances between pLGG and pHGG, we applied a random synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) analysis. Lastly, the most accurate model predictions were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The cohort included 46 patients with pLGG and 13 patients with pHGG. The developed model predictions yielded an AUC of 0.859 (95%CI: 0.752-0.966) for the DTI model, of 0.939 (95%CI: 0.879-1) for the DKI model, and of 0.946 (95%CI: 0.890-1) for the combined model, including input from both DTI and DKI metrics, which resulted in the most accurate model. Sample estimation with the random SMOTE analysis yielded an AUC of 0.98 on the testing set. Model predictions from the combined model were significantly correlated with PFS (25.2 months for pHGG vs. 40.0 months for pLGG, p < 0.001) and OS (28.9 months for pHGG vs. 44.9 months for pLGG, p < 0.001). Conclusions: a DKI-based predictive model was highly accurate for pediatric glioma grading. The combined model, derived from both DTI and DKI metrics, proved that DKI-based model predictions of tumour grade were significantly correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Thalamopeduncular tumors (TPTs) of childhood present a challenge for neurosurgeons due to their eloquent location. Preoperative fiber tracking provides total or near-total resection, without additional neurologic deficit. High-definition fiber tractography (HDFT) is an advanced white matter imaging technique derived from magnetic resonance imaging diffusion data, shown to overcome the limitations of diffusion tensor imaging. We aimed to investigate alterations of corticospinal tract (CST) and medial lemniscus (ML) caused by TPTs and to demonstrate the application of HDFT in preoperative planning.
METHODS: Three pediatric patients with TPTs were enrolled. CSTs and MLs were evaluated for displacement, infiltration, and disruption. The relationship of these tracts to tumors was identified and guided surgical planning. Literature was reviewed for publications on pediatric thalamic and TPTs that used diffusion imaging.; RESULTS: Two patients had histologic diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. One patient whose imaging suggested a low-grade glioma was managed conservatively. All tracts were displaced (1 CST anteriorly, 2 CSTs, 1 ML anteromedially, 1 ML medially, and 1 ML posteromedially). Literature review revealed 2 publications with 15 pilocytic astrocytoma cases, which investigated CST only. The condition of sensory pathway or anteromedial displacement of the CST in these tumors was not reported previously.; CONCLUSIONS: Displacement patterns of the perilesional fiber bundles by TPTs are not predictable. Fiber tracking, preferably HDFT, should be part of preoperative planning to achieve maximal extent of resection for longer survival rates in this young group of patients, while preserving white matter tracts and thus quality of life.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioblastoma is a common primary brain tumor with a poor but variable prognosis. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of MR perfusion imaging by using arterial spin-labeling for determining the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling with 3D background-suppressed gradient and spin-echo was acquired before surgery on 53 patients subsequently diagnosed with glioblastoma. The calculated CBF color maps were visually evaluated by 3 independent readers blinded to patient history. Pathologic and survival data were correlated with CBF map findings. Arterial spin-labeling values in tumor tissue were also quantified by using manual fixed-size ROIs.; RESULTS: Two perfusion patterns were characterized by visual evaluation of CBF maps on the basis of either the presence (pattern 1) or absence (pattern 2) of substantial hyperperfused tumor tissue. Evaluation of the perfusion patterns was highly concordant among the 3 readers ( = 0.898, P < .001). Pattern 1 (versus pattern 2) was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis (median progression-free survival of 182 days versus 485 days, P < .01) and trended with shorter overall survival (P = .079). There was a significant association between pattern 1 and epidermal growth factor receptor variant III expression (P < .01).; CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative evaluation of arterial spin-labeling CBF maps can be used to stratify survival and predict epidermal growth factor receptor variant III expression in patients with glioblastoma.

N2  -  Object. Despite better knowledge of cortical language organization, its subcortical anatomofunctional connectivity remains poorly understood. The authors used intraoperative subcortical stimulation in awake patients undergoing operation for a glioma in the left dominant hemisphere to map the language pathways and to determine the contribution of such a method to surgical results.
Methods. One hundred fifteen patients harboring a World Health Organization Grade II glioma within language areas underwent operation after induction of local anesthesia, using direct electrical stimulation to perform online cortical and subcortical language mapping throughout the resection.; Results. After detection of cortical language sites, the authors identified I or several of the following subcortical language pathways in all patients: 1) arcuate fasciculus, eliciting phonemic paraphasia when stimulated; 2) inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, generating semantic paraphasia when stimulated; 3) subcallosal fasciculus, inducing transcortical motor aphasia during stimulation; 4) frontoparietal phonological loop, eliciting speech apraxia during Stimulation; and 5) fibers coming from the ventral premotor cortex, inducing anarthria when stimulated. These structures were preserved, representing the limits of the resection. Despite a transient immediate postoperative worsening, all but 2 patients (98%) returned to baseline or better. On control MR imaging, 83% of resections were total or subtotal.; Conclusions. These results represent the largest experience with human subcortical language mapping ever reported. The use of intraoperative cortical and subcortical stimulation gives a unique opportunity to perform an accurate and reliable real-time anatomofunctional study of language connectivity. Such knowledge of the individual organization of language networks enables practitioners to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio of surgery for Grade II glioma within the left dominant hemisphere.

N2  -  Background: The pathophysiology of the syndrome of conduction aphasia has been thought to involve a disconnection between posterior and anterior language areas. The arcuate fasciculus has been one of the principal candidates for an anatomical link between Wernicke's and Broca's area, but direct evidence for its involvement in conduction aphasia has been difficult to obtain.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine white matter tract integrity, using the novel magnetic resonance imaging technique of diffusion tensor imaging, in a patient with transcortical aphasia.; Methods & Procedures: A case study of a 55-year-old, right-handed man with aphasia following a left hemisphere stroke is reported. The patient's language performance was assessed with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination twice: at 10 days and at 2 years after his stroke. An MR diffusion tensor imaging study was obtained approximately 2 years after his stroke using the 1.5 T Phillips Gyroscan NT system. White matter fibre tracts maps were reconstructed using the "FACT" algorithm.; Outcomes and Results: Ten days after his stroke. the patient had a non-fluent aphasia with marked impairment of both auditory comprehension and spontaneous speech. However. repetition was relatively intact. By 2 years, when the MR diffusion tensor imaging study was performed. repetition was completely normal and the patient had only subtle deficits in areas of naming and auditory comprehension, The MR diffusion tensor imaging study revealed a lesion of the dominant hemisphere arcuate fasciculus.; Conclusions: This study documents normal repetition performance in a patient who on subsequent MR diffusion tensor imaging was found to have a lesion involving the dominant hemisphere arcuate fasciculus lesion. This case adds to previously published cases of normal repetition performance despite a documented lesion of the arcuate fasciculus, and thus further challenges the traditional model of conduction aphasia invoking a critical role of this white matter tract. Our case also suggests that MR diffusion tensor imaging may be a potentially useful technique to evaluate regional involvement of specific white matter tract projections in patients with aphasia.

N2  -  We present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis), a framework for joint image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyze MR images of glioblastomas (primary brain tumors). We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach.
Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we "grow a tumor" (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. This "coupled problem" two-way couples the biophysical inversion and the registration problem. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction-diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE). In SIBIA, we couple these two sub-components in an iterative manner. We first presented the components of SIBIA in "Gholami et al., Framework for Scalable Biophysics-based Image Analysis, IEEEACM Proceedings of the SC2017", in which we derived parallel distributed memory algorithms and software modules for the decoupled registration and biophysical inverse problems. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained optimization formulation of the coupled problem, and the derivation of a Picard iterative solution scheme. We perform extensive tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different usage scenarios. We demonstrate that using SIBIA, we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions (256(3) resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Simple Summary Patients suffering from glioblastoma receive treatment according to the Stupp protocol. After chemoradiotherapy, the glioblastoma either continue to develop, or treatment-related vascular damage comes into play, both causing new, seemingly identical contrast-enhancing lesions in follow-up MRI, where clinicians and radiologists alike can only differentiate between tumor progression (TP) and treatment-related abnormalities (TRA) by seeing the temporal evolution of the lesion and the patients clinical status. We investigate the use of diffusion MRI and the quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in a retrospective patient cohort and we sought to validate a previously reported ADC cutoff value for its distinctive properties between TP and TRA. In the end, ADC values were shown not to be highly discriminative and, compared to the mean ADC values between TP and TRA previously reported in the literature, are more overlapping than expected.Abstract Distinguishing treatment-related abnormalities (TRA) from tumor progression (TP) in glioblastoma patients is a diagnostic imaging challenge due to the identical morphology of conventional MR imaging sequences. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and its derived images of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have been suggested as diagnostic tools for this problem. The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of different cut-off values of the ADC to differentiate between TP and TRA. In total, 76 post-treatment glioblastoma patients with new contrast-enhancing lesions were selected. Lesions were segmented using a T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced scan. The mean ADC values of the segmentations were compared between TRA and TP groups. Diagnostic accuracy was compared by use of the area under the curve (AUC) and the derived sensitivity and specificity values from cutoff points. Although ADC values in TP (mean = 1.32 x 10-3 mm2/s; SD = 0.31 x 10-3 mm2/s) were significantly different compared to TRA (mean = 1.53 x 10-3 mm2/s; SD = 0.28 x 10-3 mm2/s) (p = 0.003), considerable overlap in their distributions exists. The AUC of ADC values to distinguish TP from TRA was 0.71, with a sensitivity and specificity of 65% and 70%, respectively, at an ADC value of 1.47 x 10-3 mm2/s. These findings therefore indicate that ADC maps should not be used in discerning between TP and TRA at a certain timepoint without information on temporal evolution.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Distinguishing between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma brain lesions in AIDS patients is difficult but clinically relevant. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be used to distinguish these two lesions.
METHODS: The ADC values were calculated in regions of interest placed in 13 brain toxoplasmosis lesions and eight brain lymphoma lesions in patients with AIDS. These values were compared with those of normal white matter. ADC ratios in lymphoma lesions then were compared with those in toxoplasmosis lesions by using a two-sample two-tailed t test.; RESULTS: Toxoplasmosis lesions demonstrated significantly greater diffusion than that of lymphoma lesions (P = .004). ADC ratios were 1.63 +- 0.41 (mean +- standard deviation) in the 13 toxoplasmosis lesions and 1.14 +- 0.25 in the eight lymphoma lesions. While considerable overlap was present for ADC ratios between 1.0 and 1.6, ADC ratios greater than 1.6 were associated solely with toxoplasmosis, accounting for seven of 13 toxoplasmosis lesions.; CONCLUSION: ADC values are helpful in differentiating toxoplasmosis from lymphoma in patients with AIDS.

N2  -  Rotavirus, one of the major causes of severe gastroenteritis in children, occasionally causes central nervous system complications. Recently several patients with acute encephalitis/encephalopathy due to rotavirus associated with cerebellar signs and symptoms have been reported. The condition is characterized by disturbances of consciousness at onset and cerebellar signs and symptoms such as hypotonia, ataxia, dysmetria, and speech disorders, including mutism, slow speech, and dysarthria at convalescence. We report two patients (3-year-old girl, 2-year-old boy) who developed acute encephalitis due to rotavirus and showed cerebellar signs and symptoms. Both patients had characteristic history of consciousness disturbances subsequent to several days of diarrhea, vomiting and fever, and cerebellar symptoms such as hypotonia, ataxia, dysmetria, and speech disorders during the recovery period. Electroencephalography showed diffuse high-voltage delta wave activity in each patient. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebellar edema in the acute phase followed by cerebellar atrophy on follow-up images in both patients. In the first patient, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) revealed high signals at the left cerebellar peduncle region and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps showed decreased ADC values of the lesion in the acute phase. The first patient had dysmetria at 1-year follow-up. However, she had normal motor and cognitive functions and could lead her daily life without impairment. In the second patient, no further symptoms were apparent at 1-year follow-up. Acute encephalitis/encephalopathy due to rotavirus with cerebellar signs and symptoms might be diagnosed on DWI, by demonstrating decreased ADC values in acute phase.

N2  -  To evaluate diagnostic accuracy of perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using an integrated PET/MR system in tumor grading as well as in differentiating recurrent tumor from treatment-induced effects (TIE) in brain tumor patients. Twenty patients (Group A: treatment na < ve, 9 patients with 16 lesions; Group B: post-therapy, 11 patients with 18 lesions) underwent fluorine 18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) brain PET/MR with PWI. Two blinded readers predicted low versus high-grade tumor (for Group A) and tumor recurrence versus TIE (for Group B) based solely on tumor rCBV (regional cerebral blood volume) and SUV (standardized uptake values). Tumor histopathology at resection was the reference standard. Using rCBV(mean) a parts per thousand currency sign 1.74 as a cut-off, 100 % sensitivity and 74 % specificity were observed, whereas 75 % sensitivity and 89.7 % specificity were observed with SUVmean a parts per thousand currency sign 4.0 as a cut-off to classify patients as test positive for low-grade tumors (Group A) and TIE (Group B). Diagnostic accuracy for detection of low-grade tumors was 90 % using PWI and 40 % using PET in Group A (p = 0.056); for detection of TIE in Group B, diagnostic accuracy was 94.1 % using PWI and 55.6 % using PET (p = 0.033). No significant correlation was demonstrated between rCBV parameters and SUV in Group A (mean values: p > 0.403), Group B (p > 0.06) and in the entire population (p > 0.07). Best overall sensitivity and specificity were obtained using rCBV(mean) a parts per thousand currency sign 1.74 and SUVmean a parts per thousand currency sign 4.0 cut-off values. PWI demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy in both groups. Poor correlation was observed between FDG and rCBV parameters.

N2  -  Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling nonmotor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also commonly seen in healthy older adults. Our understanding of the etiology of fatigue in older adults with or without PD is limited and it remains unclear whether fatigue in PD is specifically related to PD pathology. The objective of this study was thus to determine whether fatigue in PD was associated with structural changes in gray or white matter and explore whether these changes were similar in older adults without PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (T-1 weighted) and diffusion tensor imaging were performed in 60 patients with PD (17 females; age = 67.58 +/- 5.51; disease duration = 5.67 +/- 5.83 years) and 41 age- and sex- matched healthy controls. FSL image processing was used to measure gray matter volume, fractional anisotropy, and leukoariosis differences. Voxel-based morphometry confirmed gray matter loss across the dorsal striatum and insula in the PD patient cohort. PD patients with fatigue had reduced gray matter volume in dorsal striatum relative to PD patients without fatigue (P < 0.05 False Discovery Rate corrected). No significant fatigue-related structural atrophy was found in controls. There were no areas of significant fractional anisotropy differences between high and low fatigue subjects in either the PD or non-PD groups. Control participants with high fatigue, but not PD, showed significantly greater total leukoariosis volumes (p = 0.03). Fatigue in PD is associated with unique structural changes in the caudate and putamen suggesting fatigue in PD is primarily related to PD pathology, particularly in the dorsal striatum, and not simply a consequence of aging.

N2  -  The dependence of the diffusion MRI signal on the diffusion time carries signatures of restricted diffusion and exchange. Here we seek to highlight these signatures in the human brain by performing experiments using free gradient waveforms designed to be selectively sensitive to the two effects. We examine six healthy volunteers using both strong and ultra-strong gradients (80, 200 and 300 mT/m). In an experiment featuring a large set of 150 gradient waveforms with different sensitivities to restricted diffusion and exchange, our results reveal unique and different time-dependence signatures in grey and white matter. Grey matter was characterised by both restricted diffusion and exchange and white matter predominantly by restricted diffusion. Exchange in grey matter was at least twice as fast as in white matter, across all subjects and all gradient strengths. The cerebellar cortex featured relatively short exchange times (115 ms). Furthermore, we show that gradient waveforms with tailored designs can be used to map exchange in the human brain. We also assessed the feasibility of clinical applications of the method used in this work and found that the exchange-related contrast obtained with a 25 -minute protocol at 300 mT/m was preserved in a 4-minute protocol at 300 mT/m and a 10-minute protocol at 80 mT/m. Our work underlines the utility of free waveforms for detecting time dependence signatures due to restricted diffusion and exchange in vivo, which may potentially serve as a tool for studying diseased tissue.

T2  -  CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES

N2  -  Background: Cerebral small-vessel diseases (cSVDs) encompass a number of causes involving, but not limited to, alterations in the intracranial microvasculature, leading to the accumulation of brain tissue damage and the development of various degrees of cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, gait instability, and localization signs, often associated with the occurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Summary: In 2021, although key questions remain unanswered, there is general agreement on the construct, its main pathophysiological bases, and the terms used to describe its main clinical and radiological features. However, this has not always been the case, and the 30th anniversary of Cerebrovascular Diseases is an opportunity to look back from 1991 to the present to understand how a number of features, sometimes considered independent, have been progressively brought together by successive scientific breakthroughs, gradually leading to the definition of the now widely accepted concept of cSVDs. Key Messages: In the course of this journey, we will detail with particular attention the role of what we consider 2 crucial events: the advent of cerebral MRI and the building of large cohorts with monogenic forms of small-vessel disease of the brain.

N2  -  Stroke is characterized by delays in the resting-state hemodynamic response, resulting in synchronization lag in neural activity between brain regions. However, the structural basis of this lag remains unclear. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to characterize synchronization lag profiles between homotopic regions in 15 individuals (14 males, 1 female) with brain lesions consequent to stroke as well as a group of healthy comparison individuals. We tested whether the network communication efficiency of each individual's structural brain network (connectome) could explain interindividual and interregional variation in synchronization lag profiles. To this end, connectomes were mapped using diffusion MRI data, and communication measures were evaluated under two schemes: shortest paths and navigation. We found that interindividual variation in synchronization lags was inversely associated with communication efficiency under both schemes. Interregional variation in lag was related to navigation efficiency and navigation distance, reflecting its dependence on both distance and structural constraints. Moreover, severity of motor deficits significantly correlated with average synchronization lag in stroke. Our results provide a structural basis for the delay of information transfer between homotopic regions inferred from rs-fMRI and provide insight into the clinical significance of structural-functional relationships in stroke individuals.

N2  -  Surgical resection is the primary treatment of pilocytic astrocytomas and total removal can be curative. However, these lesions occur in critical areas, such as the thalamus, being surrounded by critical life neurovascular structures, which imposes a surgical challenge.(1-5) Exhaustive acquisition and meticulous interpretation of preoperative radiological exams; reliable surgical orientation based on profound microneurosurgical anatomic knowledge and judicious discernment of the neuroanatomic distortions on the surface and deep-seated structures inflicted by the neuropathological entity; embracing and comprehensive application of the vast scope of available intraoperative guidance imaging and neurophysiological monitoring; in alliance with the mastered carefully microsurgical technique supported by endoscopic visualization are the keystones to the pursed duet "cure with quality of life" in the treatment of these lesions.
We present the case of a 17-yr-old young lady with a progressive motor deficit in her right hemibody for over 2 yr. Her radiological investigation demonstrated a left thalamic lesion displacing the projection fibers (corticospinal tract) within the internal capsule laterally. The patient consented to the surgical procedure. The surgical strategy, intraoperative findings, and microsurgical and endoscopic technique, as well as the postoperative radiological and clinical evaluation are presented.; The patient gave her informed consent for the publication of the case.

N2  -  The purpose of our study was to identify the perfusion MRI (pMRI) algorithm which yields a volume of hypoperfused tissue that best correlates with the acute clinical deficit as quantified by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and therefore reflects critically hypoperfused tissue. A group of 20 patients with a first acute stroke and stroke MRI within 24 h of symptom onset were retrospectively analyzed. Perfusion maps were derived using four different algorithms to estimate relative mean transit time (rMTT): (1) cerebral blood flow (CBF) arterial input function (AIF)/singular voxel decomposition (SVD); (2) area peak; (3) time to peak (TTP); and (4) first moment method. Lesion volumes based on five different MTT thresholds relative to contralateral brain were compared with each other and correlated with NIHSS score. The first moment method had the highest correlation with NIHSS (r=0.79, P < 0.001) followed by the AIF/SVD method, both of which did not differ significantly from each other with regard to lesion volumes. TTP and area peak derived both volumes, which correlated poorly or only moderately with NIHSS scores. Data from our pilot study suggest that the first moment and the AIF/SVD method have advantages over the other algorithms in identifying the pMRI lesion volume that best reflects clinical severity. At present there seems to be no need for extensive postprocessing and arbitrarily defined delay thresholds in pMRI as the simple qualitative approach with a first moment algorithm is equally accurate. Larger sample sizes which allow comparison between imaging and clinical outcomes are needed to refine the choice of best perfusion parameter in pMRI.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is an important cause of vascular cognitive impairment. It is usually sporadic but also occurs secondary to the genetic disorder cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Recurrent lacunar stroke is a characteristic feature, although symptomatic events are relatively rare, making large numbers necessary for evaluation of potential therapies. Diffusion-weighted imaging is sensitive to acute ischemic lesions and differentiates them from chronic infarcts. Detection of asymptomatic lacunar infarcts with diffusion-weighted imaging is a potential surrogate marker for treatment trials. In this study, the frequency of asymptomatic new lesions in ischemic leukoaraiosis and CADASIL was determined as a step toward assessing the potential of this technique as a surrogate marker of disease activity.
METHODS: Fifty patients with sporadic small vessel disease and 19 patients with CADASIL underwent diffusion-weighted imaging. All had been asymptomatic for 3 months before imaging. Diffusion-weighted images were screened by two raters for new lesions; lesions were confirmed as recent by a visible reduction of diffusivity on the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient maps.; RESULTS: Recent ischemic lesions were identified in four patients with sporadic small vessel disease (8.0%) and two patients with CADASIL (10.5%).; CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic new lesions are found in cases of sporadic small vessel disease and CADASIL. The frequency of new lesions suggests that this approach has a potential role as a surrogate marker in therapeutic trials that warrants further investigation.

N2  -  In vivo mapping of the neurite density with diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a high but challenging aim. First, it is unknown whether all neurites exhibit completely anisotropic ("stick-like") diffusion. Second, the "density" of tissue components may be confounded by non-diffusion properties such as T2 relaxation. Third, the domain of validity for the estimated parameters to serve as indices of neurite density is incompletely explored. We investigated these challenges by acquiring data with "b-tensor encoding" and multiple echo times in brain regions with low orientation coherence and in white matter lesions. Results showed that microscopic anisotropy from b-tensor data is associated with myelinated axons but not with dendrites. Furthermore, b-tensor data together with data acquired for multiple echo times showed that unbiased density estimates in white matter lesions require data-driven estimates of compartment-specific T2 values. Finally, the "stick" fractions of different biophysical models could generally not serve as neurite density indices across the healthy brain and white matter lesions, where outcomes of comparisons depended on the choice of constraints. In particular, constraining compartment-specific T2 values was ambiguous in the healthy brain and had a large impact on estimated values. In summary, estimating neurite density generally requires accounting for different diffusion and/or T2 properties between axons and dendrites. Constrained "index" parameters could be valid within limited domains that should be delineated by future studies.

N2  -  Background and purpose. - The ability to predict high-grade meningioma preoperatively is important for clinical surgical planning. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of comprehensive multiparametric MRI, including susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in predicting high-grade meningioma both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Methods. - Ninety-two low-grade and 37 higher grade meningiomas in 129 patients were included in this study. Morphological characteristics, quantitative histogram analysis of QSM and ADC images, and tumor size were evaluated to predict high-grade meningioma using univariate and multivariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed on the morphological characteristics. Associations between Ki-67 proliferative index (PI) and quantitative parameters were calculated using Pearson correlation analyses.; Results. - For predicting high-grade meningiomas, the best predictive model in multivariate logistic regression analyses included calcification (beta = 0.874, beta = 0.110), peritumoral edema (beta = 0.554, P= 0.042), tumor border (beta = 0.862, P= 0.024), tumor location (beta = 0.545, P= 0.039) for morphological characteristics, and tumor size (beta =4 x 10(-5) , P= 0.004), QSM kurtosis (beta= - 5 x 10(-3) , P= 0.058), QSM entropy (beta= - 0.067, beta = 0.054), maximum ADC (beta = -1.6 x 10(-3), beta = 0.003), ADC kurtosis (beta = - 0.013, beta = 0.014) for quantitative characteristics. ROC analyses on morphological characteristics resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (0.61-0.81) for a combination of them. There were significant correlations between Ki-67 PI and mean ADC (r = - 0.277, P= 0.031), 25th percentile of ADC (r = - 0.275, P = 0.032), and 50th percentile of ADC (r = - 0.268, P = 0.037).; Conclusions. - Although SWI and QSM did not improve differentiation between low and high-grade meningiomas, combining morphological characteristics and quantitative metrics can help predict high-grade meningioma.

N2  -  We have tested the predictive value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis in stratifying progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in bevacizumab-treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from the multi-center BRAIN study. Available MRI's from patients enrolled in the BRAIN study (n = 97) were examined by generating ADC histograms from areas of enhancing tumor on T1 weighted post-contrast images fitted to a two normal distribution mixture curve. ADC classifiers including the mean ADC from the lower curve (ADC-L) and the mean lower curve proportion (LCP) were tested for their ability to stratify PFS and OS by using Cox proportional hazard ratios and the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Mean ADC-L was 1,209 x 10(-6)mm(2)/s +/- A 224 (SD), and mean LCP was 0.71 +/- A 0.23 (SD). Low ADC-L was associated with worse outcome. The hazard ratios for 6-month PFS, overall PFS, and OS in patients with less versus greater than mean ADC-L were 3.1 (95 % confidence interval: 1.6, 6.1; P = 0.001), 2.3 (95 % CI: 1.3, 4.0; P = 0.002), and 2.4 (95 % CI: 1.4, 4.2; P = 0.002), respectively. In patients with ADC-L < 1,209 and LCP > 0.71 versus ADC-L > 1,209 and LCP < 0.71, there was a 2.28-fold reduction in the median time to progression, and a 1.42-fold decrease in the median OS. The predictive value of ADC histogram analysis, in which low ADC-L was associated with poor outcome, was confirmed in bevacizumab-treated patients with recurrent GBM in a post hoc analysis from the multi-center (BRAIN) study.

N2  -  Objective: The generation of numerous sequences and quantitative data in a short scanning time is the most potential advantage of Synthetic MRI (SyMRI). We aimed to test detection of the tubers and to determine underlying tissue characteristics, and morphometric alterations in the brain of pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients, using SyMRI.
Methods: Conventional brain MRI (cMRI) and SyMRI were prospectively obtained from 10 TSC patients and 18 healthy control subjects (HCs). Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated tubers on both scans. Additionally, automatically segmented volume calculation and myelin quantification, including the subcortical part of the tubers and normal-appearing brain parenchyma (NABP) of patients, were carried out using SyMRI.; Results: The cMRI and SyMRI comparison showed a very good correlation on the detection of the tubers (k = 0.82-0.94). Automatic segmentation of Non-gray matterwhite mattercerebrospinal fluid (Non), %Nonbrain parenchymal volume, and %Nonintracranial volume was significantly higher; however, %Myelinintracranial volume and %Myelinbrain parenchymal volume were significantly lower in the TSC patients (p < 0.05). The proton density values were significantly increased, and myelin fraction volume and myelin-correlated compound values were significantly decreased in the NABP in TSC patients on myelin maps (p < 0.05). The white-matter volume, myelin and white-matter fractional volume, longitudinal relaxation rate, transverse relaxation rate, and myelin-correlated compound values were significantly decreased in the subcortical part of tubers on quantification maps (p < 0.001) in TSC patients.; Conclusion: SyMRI enables the detection of cortical tubers and is a developing tool in the quantification of morphometric and tissue alterations in pediatric TSC patients with a rational scanning time.

N2  -  MR acoustic radiation force imaging provides a promising method to monitor therapeutic ultrasound treatments. By measuring the displacement induced by the acoustic radiation force, MR acoustic radiation force imaging can locate the focal spot, without a significant temperature rise. In this work, the encoding gradient for MR acoustic radiation force imaging is optimized to achieve an enhanced accuracy and precision of the displacement measurement. By analyzing the sources of artifacts, bulk motion and eddy currents are shown to introduce errors to the measurement, and heavy diffusion-weighting is shown to result in noisy displacement maps. To eliminate these problems, a new encoding scheme is proposed, which utilizes a pair of bipolar gradients. Improved precision is achieved with robustness against bulk motion and background phase distortion, and improved accuracy is achieved with reduced diffusion-weighting and optimized encoding pulse width. The experiment result shows that the signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced by more than 2-fold. These significant improvements are obtained at no cost of scan time or encoding sensitivity, enabling the detection of a displacement less than 0.1 gm in a gel phantom with MR acoustic radiation force imaging.

N2  -  Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite advancement in treatment modalities, recurrence remains common, even among those treated with a combination of neurosurgery, craniospinal irradiation, and chemotherapy. The diagnosis of recurrence is usually not difficult in these cases. However, it may pose a challenge in cases with unusual clinical presentation and imaging. Imaging findings on magnetic resonance imaging, with application of perfusion, in conjunction with positron emission tomography-computed tomography can help in clinching the diagnosis in such cases. MB subgroups show consistent patterns even in cases of recurrence, and sonic hedgehog group MB may present as local recurrence showing enhancement with no diffusion restriction, as demonstrated in this case.

N2  -  Quantitative MRI with T2, T2*, and T2' mapping has been shown to non-invasively depict microstructural changes (T2) and oxygenation status (T2* and T2') that are invisible on conventional MRI. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether T2 and T2' quantification detects cerebral (micro-)structural damage and chronic hypoxia in lesions and in normal appearing white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) of patients with ischemic leukoaraiosis (IL). Measurements were complemented by the assessment of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the degree of GM and WM atrophy.
Eighteen patients with IL and 18 age-matched healthy controls were included. High-resolution, motion-corrected T2, T2*, and T2' mapping, CBF mapping (pulsed arterial spin labeling, PASL), and segmentation of GM and WM were used to depict specific changes in both groups. All parameters were compared between patients and healthy controls, using t testing. Values of p < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.; Patients showed significantly increased T2 in lesions (p < 0.01) and in unaffected WM (p = 0.045) as well as significantly increased T2* in lesions (p = 0.003). A significant decrease of T2' was detected in patients in unaffected WM (p = 0.027), while no T2' changes were observed in GM (p = 0.13). Both unaffected WM and GM were significantly decreased in volume in the patient-group (p < 0.01). No differences of PASL-based CBF could be shown.; Non-invasive quantitative MRI with T2, T2*, and T2' mapping might be used to detect subtle structural and metabolic changes in IL. Assessing the grade of microstructural damage and hypoxia might be helpful to monitor disease progression and to perform risk assessment.

N2  -  Background Multicompartmental modeling outperforms conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the assessment of prostate cancer. Optimized multicompartmental models could further improve the detection and characterization of prostate cancer.
Purpose To optimize multicompartmental signal models and apply them to study diffusion in normal and cancerous prostate tissue in vivo.; Study Type Retrospective.; Subjects Forty-six patients who underwent MRI examination for suspected prostate cancer; 23 had prostate cancer and 23 had no detectable cancer.; Field StrengthSequence 3T multishell diffusion-weighted sequence.; Assessment Multicompartmental models with 2-5 tissue compartments were fit to DWI data from the prostate to determine optimal compartmental apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). These ADCs were used to compute signal contributions from the different compartments. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and model-fitting residuals were calculated to quantify model complexity and goodness-of-fit. Tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and tumor-to-background signal intensity ratio (SIR) were computed for conventional DWI and multicompartmental signal-contribution maps.; Statistical Tests Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-tests (alpha = 0.05) were used to compare fitting residuals between prostate regions and between multicompartmental models. T-tests (alpha = 0.05) were also used to assess differences in compartmental signal-fraction between tissue types and CNRSIR between conventional DWI and multicompartmental models.; Results The lowest BIC was observed from the 4-compartment model, with optimal ADCs of 5.2e-4, 1.9e-3, 3.0e-3, and >3.0e-2 mm(2)sec. Fitting residuals from multicompartmental models were significantly lower than from conventional ADC mapping (P < 0.05). Residuals were lowest in the peripheral zone and highest in tumors. Tumor tissue showed the largest reduction in fitting residual by increasing model order. Tumors had a greater proportion of signal from compartment 1 than normal tissue (P < 0.05). Tumor CNR and SIR were greater on compartment-1 signal maps than conventional DWI (P < 0.05) and increased with model order.; Data Conclusion The 4-compartment signal model best described diffusion in the prostate. Compartmental signal contributions revealed by this model may improve assessment of prostate cancer.; Level of Evidence 3; Technical Efficacy Stage 3

N2  -  Background Multi-b-valued/multi-shell diffusion provides potentially valuable metrics in breast MRI but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and has potentially long scan times. Purpose To investigate the effects of model-based denoising with no loss of spatial resolution on multi-shell breast diffusion MRI; to determine the effects of downsampling on multi-shell diffusion; and to quantify these effects in multi-b-valued (three directions per b-value) acquisitions. Study Type Prospective ("fully-sampled" multi-shell) and retrospective longitudinal (multi-b). Subjects One normal subject (multi-shell) and 10 breast cancer subjects imaging at four timepoints (multi-b). Field Strength/Sequence 3T multi-shell acquisition and 1.5T multi-b acquisition. Assessment The "fully-sampled" multi-shell acquisition was retrospectively downsampled to determine the bias and error from downsampling. Mean, axial/parallel, radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy (FA) were analyzed. Denoising was applied retrospectively to the multi-b-valued breast cancer subject dataset and assessed subjectively for image noise level and tumor conspicuity. Statistical Tests Parametric pairedt-test (P < 0.05 considered statistically significant) on mean and coefficient of variation of each metric-the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from all b-values, fast ADC, slow ADC, and perfusion fraction. Paired and two-samplet-tests for each metric comparing normal and tumor tissue. Results In the multi-shell data, denoising effectively suppressed FA (-45% to -78%), with small biases in mean diffusivity (-5% in normal, +23% in tumor, and -4% in vascular compartments). In the multi-b data, denoising resulted in small biases to the ADC metrics in tumor and normal contralateral tissue (by -3% to +11%), but greatly reduced the coefficient of variation for every metric (by -1% to -24%). Denoising improved differentiation of tumor and normal tissue regions in most metrics and timepoints; subjectively, image noise level and tumor conspicuity were improved in the fast ADC maps. Data Conclusion Model-based denoising effectively suppressed erroneously high FA and improved the accuracy of diffusivity metrics. Evidence Level 3 Technical Efficacy Stage 1

N2  -  Objective: Early changes in tumour behaviour following stereotactic radiosurgery) are potential biomarkers of response. To-date quantitative model-based measures of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI parameters have shown widely variable findings, which may be attributable to variability in image acquisition, post-processing and analysis. Big data analytic approaches are needed for the automation of computationally intensive modelling calculations for every voxel, independent of observer interpretation.
Methods: This unified platform is a voxel-based, multimodality architecture that brings complimentary solute transport processes such as perfusion and diffusion into a common framework. The methodology was tested on synthetic data and digital reference objects and consequently evaluated in patients who underwent volumetric DCE-CT, DCE-MRI and DWI-MRI scans before and after treatment. Three-dimensional pharmacokinetic parameter maps from both modalities were compared as well as the correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and the extravascular, extracellular volume (V-e). Comparison of histogram parameters was done via Bland-Altman analysis, as well as Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation using two-sided analysis.; Results: System testing on synthetic Tofts model data and digital reference objects recovered the ground truth parameters with mean relative percent error of 1.07 x 10(-7) and 5.60 x 10(-4) respectively. Direct voxel-to-voxel Pearson's analysis showed statistically significant correlations between CT and MR which peaked at Day 7 for K-trans (R = 0.74, p <= 0.0001). Statistically significant correlations were also present between ADC and Ve derived from both DCE-MRI and DCE-CT with highest median correlations found at Day 3 between median ADC and Ve,(MRI) values (R = 0.6, p < 0.01) The strongest correlation to DCE-CT measurements was found with DCE-MRI analysis using voxelwise T-10 maps (R = 0.575, p < 0.001) instead of assigning a fixed T-10 value.; Conclusion: The unified implementation of multiparametric transport modelling allowed for more robust and timely observer-independent data analytics. Utility of a common analysis platform has shown higher correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from different modalities than has previously been reported.; Advances in knowledge: Utility of a common analysis platform has shown statistically higher correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from different modalities than has previously been reported.

N2  -  Objective: Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) predict future stroke. However, there are no sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for TIA and interobserver agreement regarding the diagnosis is poor. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) demonstrates acute ischemic lesions in approximately 30% of TIA patients; the yield of perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) is unclear.
Methods: We prospectively performed both DWI and PWI within 48 hours of symptom onset in consecutive patients admitted with suspected hemispheric TIAs of < 24 hours symptom duration. Two independent raters, blinded to clinical features, assessed the presence and location of acute DWI and PWI lesions. Lesions were correlated with suspected clinical localization and baseline characteristics. Clinical features predictive of a PWI lesion were assessed.; Results: Forty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three percent had a PWI lesion and 35% had a DWI lesion. Seven patients (16%) had both PWI and DWI lesions and 7(16%) had only PWI lesions. The combined yield for identification of either a PWI or a DWI was 51%. DWI lesions occurred in the clinically suspected hemisphere in 93% of patients; PWI lesions in 86%. PWI lesions occurred more frequently when the MRI was performed within 12 hours of symptom resolution, in patients with symptoms of speech impairment, and among individuals younger than 60 years.; Conclusions: The combination of early diffusion-weighted MRI and perfusion-weighted MRI can document the presence of a cerebral ischemic lesion in approximately half of all patients who present with a suspected hemispheric transient ischemic attack (TIA). MRI has the potential to improve the accuracy of TIA diagnosis. Neurology (R) 2009;72:1127-1133

N2  -  In this article, we briefly review the concept of brain mapping in stereotactic surgery taking into account recent advances in stereotactic imaging. The gold standard continues to rely on probabilistic and indirect targeting, relative to a stereotactic reference, i.e., mostly the anterior (AC) and the posterior (PC) commissures. The theoretical position of a target defined on an atlas is transposed into the stereotactic space of a patient's brain; final positioning depends on electrophysiological analysis. The method is also used to analyze final electrode or lesion position for a patient or group of patients, by projection on an atlas. Limitations are precision of definition of the AC-PC tine, probabilistic location and reliability of the electrophysiological guidance. Advances in MR imaging, as from 1.5-T machines, make stereotactic references no longer mandatory and allow an anatomic mapping based on an individual patient's brain. Direct targeting is enabled by high-quality images, an advanced anatomic knowledge and dedicated surgical software. Labeling associated with manual segmentation can help for the position analysis along non-conventional, interpolated planes. Analysis of final electrode or lesion position, for a patient or group of patients, could benefit from the concept of membership, the attribution of a weighted membership degree to a contact or a structure according to its level of involvement. In the future, more powerful MRI machines, diffusion tensor imaging, tractography and computational modeling will further the understanding of anatomy and deep brain stimulation effects.

N2  -  Oral reading is a complex skill involving the interaction of orthographic, phonological, and semantic processes. Functional imaging studies with nonimpaired adult readers have identified a widely distributed network of frontal, inferior parietal, posterior temporal, and occipital brain regions involved in the task. However, while functional imaging can identify cortical regions engaged in the process under examination, it cannot identify those brain regions essential for the task. The current study aimed to identify those neuroanatomical regions critical for successful oral reading by examining the relationship between word and nonword oral reading deficits and areas of tissue dysfunction in acute stroke. We evaluated 91 patients with left hemisphere ischemic stroke with a test of oral word and nonword reading, and magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted imaging, within 24-48 h of stroke onset. A voxel-wise statistical map showed that impairments in word and nonword reading were associated with a distributed network of brain regions, including the inferior and middle frontal gyri, the middle temporal gyrus, the supramarginal and angular gyri, and the middle occipital gyrus. In addition, lesions associated with word deficits were found to be distributed more frontally, while nonword deficits were associated with lesions distributed more posteriorly.

N2  -  Background: To investigate the accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the differentiation between medulloblastoma and ependymoma tumors. Materials and Methods: A retrospectively analytical study was used. Eighty-nine patients with medulloblastoma and ependymoma tumors were included, as proved by the histopathological findings (2016-2019), and their ages ranged from 1 month to 15 years old. All DWI data were transferred through RadiAnt Dicom viewer and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value calculations. Statistical analyses were conducted utilizing statistical software (MedCalc, version 19.0.4). Results: The value of ADCmean was the significant ADC value that distinguished medulloblastoma from ependymoma. The value of ADCmean was inversely proportional to tumor grades. The ADCmean value at the ependymoma tumor was 1.141 +/- 0.293 mm2/s, whereas the ADCmean value at medulloblastoma tumor was 0.661 +/- 0.123 mm2/s. Spearman's correlation shows a significant negative correlation, and ADCmean (r = -0.72, P-value = 0.0001). The ADCmean has confirmed the highest diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.984 in cases in reference to histopathological findings as a gold standard and detects medulloblastomas and ependymomas tumors with sensitivity (96.92%), specificity (95.83%), PPV (98.4%,), NPV (92%) and accuracy (92.7%). There is a high level of agreement between the results of ADC value and histopathological findings, which is excellent agreement between the two tests as Kappa =0.915. ADCmean could serve as a base to distinguish medulloblastoma from ependymoma tumors with high accuracy. Conclusion: Using ADC map value to diagnose pediatric tumors could provide reliable and objective evidence for pre-operative differentiation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the hypothesis that water diffusion alterations are present in normal-appearing white matter of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (FIRMS) and to assess their change with time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with clinically diagnosed RRMS, with disease duration of less than 12 months and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of < 3.5, underwent a diffusion 3T MR imaging study. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps generated were compared with those of 18 control subjects. Eighteen of the 54 patients underwent MR imaging assessment at 3 and 6 months after baseline evaluation. Remitting patients were clinically and MR imaging stable for the 2 months before the study. All patients were drug-free for the 3 months before the study, and in the relapsing patients, the MR imaging was always performed before beginning treatment.; RESULTS: Mean ADC values showed significant differences when relapsing, remitting, and control patients were compared. The relapsing or remitting phase showed significant difference when compared both with controls (P <.01) and between them (P <.05), Comparing mean ADC values of patients with clinical disability (EDSS < 2 versus EDSS >= 2) also provided significant differences with the control group (P <.01). The data of patients showing a relapsing episode during the longitudinal part of the study showed a significant difference compared with data from their remitting phase P <.01).; CONCLUSION: Brain microstructural changes can be detected and correlate with clinical impairment during the stages of MS. These changes modify with time in the relapsing group.

N2  -  Purpose: The centrally restricted diffusion sign of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is associated with radiation necrosis (RN) in treated gliomas. Our goal was to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy to distinguish RN from tumor recurrence (TR) in treated brain metastases. Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive patients with brain metastases who developed a newly centrally necrotic lesion after radiotherapy (RT). One reader placed regions of interest (ROI) in the enhancing solid lesion and the non-enhancing central necrosis on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Two readers qualitatively assessed the presence of the centrally restricted diffusion sign. The final diagnosis was made by histopathology (n = 39) or imaging follow-up (n = 2). Differences between groups were assessed by Fisher's exact or Mann-Whitney U tests. Diagnostic accuracy and inter-reader agreement were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and kappa scores. Results: Forty-one lesions (32 predominant RN; 9 predominant TR) were analyzed. An ADC value <= 1220 x 10-6 mm2/s (sensitivity 74%, specificity 89%, area under the curve [AUC] .85 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .70-.94] P < .0001) from the necrosis and an ADC necrosis/enhancement ratio <= 1.37 (sensitivity 74%, specificity 89%, AUC .82 [95% CI, .67-.93] P < .0001) provided the highest performance for RN diagnosis. The qualitative centrally restricted diffusion sign had a sensitivity of 69% (95% CI, .50-.83), specificity of 77% (95% CI, .40-.96), and a moderate (k = .49) inter-reader agreement for RN diagnosis. Conclusions: Radiation necrosis is associated with lower ADC values in the central necrosis than TR. A moderate interobserver agreement might limit the qualitative assessment of the centrally restricted diffusion sign.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is now widely used in neurosurgery to preoperatively delineate the course of the pyramidal tract.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of the method by comparison with subcortical electrical stimulation and to evaluate the influence of the distance of the pyramidal tract from the tumor on the resection extent and postoperative clinical deficits.; METHODS: A diffusion tensor imaging depiction of the pyramidal tract was used in preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation in 72 cases. In 36 cases, subcortical electrical stimulation was used during the resection. The preoperative tumor-to-tract distance was compared with the stimulation result, the extent of resection, and the short-term postoperative course.; RESULTS: A significant nonlinear relationship between the tract-to-tumor distance and the probability of a motor response to subcortical stimulation was observed. The largest preoperatively measured tumor-to-tract distance with a positive stimulation result was 8 mm. Moreover, we observed a trend toward transient postoperative motor deterioration in patients with tumors close to the pyramidal tract. Resection extent was not significantly affected by the tumor-to-tract distance.; CONCLUSION: Despite methodological obstacles, reasonable accuracy of the diffusion tensor imaging reconstructions of the pyramidal tracts was confirmed by our study. The occurrence of transient postoperative motor deterioration is higher in patients with tumors located close to the pyramidal tract.

N2  -  Background: To map and quantify the proton exchange rate (k(ex)) of brain tissues using improved omega plots in ischemic stroke patients and to investigate whether k(ex) can serve as a potential endogenous surrogate imaging biomarker for detecting the metabolic state and the pathologic changes due to ischemic stroke.
New Method: Three sets of Z-spectra were acquired from seventeen ischemic stroke patients using a spin echoecho planar imaging sequence with pre-saturation chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) pulse at B-1 of 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 mu T, respectively. Pixel-wise k(ex) was calculated from improved omega plot of water direct saturation (DS)-removed Z-spectral signals.; Results: The derived k(ex) maps can differentiate infarcts from contralateral normal brain tissues with significantly increased signal (893 +- 52 s(-1) vs. 739 +- 34 s(-1), P < 0.001).; Comparison with Existing Method(s): The k(ex) maps were found to be different from conventional contrasts from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), CEST, and semi-solid magnetization transfer (MT) MRI. In brief, k(ex) MRI showed larger lesion areas than DWI with different degrees and different lesion contrast compared to CEST and MT.; Conclusions: In this preliminary translational research, the k(ex) MRI based on DS-removed omega plots has been demonstrated for in vivo imaging of clinical ischemic stroke patients. As a noninvasive and unique MRI contrast, k(ex) MRI at 3 T may serve as a potential surrogate imaging biomarker for the metabolic changes of stroke and help for monitoring the evolution and the treatment of stroke.

N2  -  Background: Conventional MRI fails to detect regions of glioblastoma cell infiltration beyond the contrastenhanced T1 solid tumor region, with infiltrating tumor cells often migrating along host blood vessels. Purpose: MRI is capable of generating a range of image contrasts which are commonly assessed individually by qualitative visual inspection. It has long been hypothesized that better diagnoses could be achieved by combining these multiple images, so called multi-parametric or multi-spectral MRI. However, the lack of clinical histology and the difficulties of co-registration, has meant this hypothesis has never been rigorously tested. Here we test this hypothesis, using a previously published multi-dimensional dataset consisting of registered MR images and histology. Study type: Animal Model. Subjects: Mice bearing orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts generated from a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line. Field strength/sequences: 7 Tesla, T1/T2 weighted, T2 mapping, contrast enhance T1, diffusion-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging. Assessment: Immunohistochemistry sections were stained for Human Leukocyte Antigen (probing human-derived tumor cells). To achieve quantitative MRI-tissue comparison, multiple histological slices cut in the MRI plane were stacked to produce tumor cell density maps acting as 'ground truth'. Statistical tests: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Dice similarity indices were calculated. ANOVA, t-test, Bonferroni correction and Pearson coefficients were used for statistical analysis. Results: Correlation coefficient analysis with co-registered 'ground truth' histology showed interactive regression maps had higher correlation coefficients and sensitivity values than T2W, ADC, FA, and T2map. Further, the interaction regression maps showed statistical improved detection of tumor volume. Data conclusion: Voxel-by-voxel analysis provided quantitative evidence confirming the hypothesis that mpMRI can, potentially, better distinguish between the tumor region and normal tissue.

N2  -  Purpose: This paper is a preliminary attempt to compare the diagnostic efficiency and performance of Fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, exponential ADC (eADC) map, T1 map, and Susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) for glioma grading and combine these image data pairs to compare the diagnostic performance of different image data pairs for glioma grading. Material and methods: Fifty-nine patients underwent FLAIR, ADC map, eADC map, Variable flip-angle (VFA) spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) method, and SWI MRI imaging. The T1 map was reconstructed by the VFASPGR method. The average Relative Signal Contrast (RSC) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated in a different image. The multivariate binary logistic regression model combined different image data pairs. Results: The average RSC of SWI and ADC maps in high-grade glioma is significantly lower than RSCs in lowgrade. The average RSC of the eADC map and T1 maps increased with glioma grade. No significant difference was detected between low and high-grade glioma on FLAIR images. The AUC for low and high-grade glioma differentiation on ADC maps, eADC maps, T1 map, and SWI were calculated 0.781, 0.864, 0.942, and 0.904, respectively. Also, by adding different image data, diagnostic performance was increased. Conclusion: Interestingly, the T1 map and SWI image have the potential to use in the clinic for glioma grading purposes due to their high performance. Also, the eADC map+T1 map and T1 map+SWI image weights have the highest diagnostic performance for glioma grading.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. This study intended to investigate the usefulness of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for discriminating primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSLs), especially atypical PCNSLs, from tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty-seven patients with PCNSLs and 18 with TDLs were enrolled in our study. Hyperintense lesions seen on T2-weighted images were defined as ROIs after ADC maps were registered to the corresponding T2-weighted image. ADC histograms were calculated from the ROIs containing the entire lesion on every section and on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The ADC histogram parameters were compared among all PCNSLs and TDLs as well as between the subgroup of atypical PCNSLs and TDLs. ROC curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the histogram parameters and to determine the optimum thresholds.; RESULTS. The differences between the PCNSLs and TDLs were found in the minimum ADC values (ADC(min)) and in the 5th and 10th percentiles (ADC 5% and ADC 10%) of the cumulative ADC histograms. However, no statistical significance was found in the mean ADC value or in the ADC value concerning the mode, kurtosis, and skewness. The ADC(min), ADC 5%, and ADC 10% were also lower in atypical PCNSLs than in TDLs. ADC(min) was the best indicator for discriminating atypical PCNSLs from TDLs, with a threshold of 556 x 10-6 mm(2)s (sensitivity, 81.3 %; specificity, 88.9%).; CONCLUSION. Histogram analysis of ADC maps may help to discriminate PCNSLs from TDLs and may be particularly useful in differentiating atypical PCNSLs from TDLs.

N2  -  Purpose Diffuse cortical damage in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is clinically relevant but cannot be directly assessed with conventional MRI. In this study, it was aimed to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with optimized intrinsic eddy current compensation to quantify and characterize cortical mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in RRMS and to analyze the distribution of these changes across the cortex. Materials and Methods Three-Tesla MRI acquisition, mapping of the MD providing information about the integrity of microstructural barriers and of the FA reflecting axonal density and surface-based analysis with Freesurfer were performed for 24 RRMS patients and 25 control subjects. Results Across the whole cortex, MD was increased in patients (p < 0.001), while surface-based analysis revealed focal cortical FA decreases. MD and FA changes were distributed inhomogeneously across the cortex, the MD increase being more widespread than the FA decrease. Cortical MD correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS, r = 0.38, p = 0.03). Conclusion Damage of microstructural barriers occurs inhomogeneously across the cortex in RRMS and might be spatially more widespread than axonal degeneration. The results and, in particular, the correlation with the clinical status indicate that DTI might be a promising technique for the monitoring of cortical damage under treatment in larger clinical studies.

N2  -  Background The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations stroke severity, aphasia severity, lesion location and lesion size in acute stroke, and aphasia severity in the subacute and chronic stages post stroke. We hypothesized that initial stroke severity and aphasia severity were associated with the patient's aphasia severity in the subacute and chronic stages of stroke. We expected to find that lesions within the left frontotemporal regions of the brain were associated with aphasia severity post-stroke. Methods Thirty-three patients with aphasia were included in the study. They were assessed with a standardized aphasia test at admission to the hospital (T1), after 3 months (T2) and finally after 12 months (T3). Stroke severity, initial physical impairment, and initial functional independence were also assessed at T1. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed as clinical-routine at admission. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping and a region of interest analysis (ROI) was performed to analyze MRI-findings. Results & Outcomes Initial lesion size and aphasia severity were associated with aphasia severity at T2. Initial stroke severity, aphasia severity, and lesion size were not associated with aphasia severity at T3, but the patients' aphasia severity at T2 predicted aphasia severity at T3. Lesion analysis showed that lesions within the left postcentral gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus were significantly associated with aphasia severity at T3. The ROI-analysis did not yield any significant regions of interest to explain the total variance of the patients' change in scores on the aphasia test from T1 to T3. Conclusion Lesions within the postcentral gyrus and the inferior parietal gyrus are associated with aphasia severity at T3. Lesion size in the acute stages of stroke is associated with aphasia severity at T1 and T2, but not T3. However, neither initial aphasia severity nor stroke severity was associated with aphasia severity at T3. Aphasia severity in T2 is however strongly associated with aphasia severity in T3.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Studies detailing the anatomy of the basal forebrain (BF) from a neurosurgical perspective are missing.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the anatomy of the BF and of the anterior perforated substance (APS), the BF emphasizing surgical useful anatomical relationship between surface landmarks and deep structures.; METHODS: White matter fiber microdissection was performed on 5 brain specimens to analyze the topographic anatomy of the APS and expose layer-by-layer fiber tracts and nuclei of the BF.; RESULTS: The APS, as identified anatomically, surgically, and neuroradiologically, has clear borders measured 23.3 +- 3.4 mm (19-27) in the mediolateral and 12.5 +- 1.2 mm (11-14) in the anteroposterior directions. A detailed stratigraphy of the BF was performed from the APS up to basal ganglia and thalamus allowing identification and dissection of the main components of the BF (septum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, innominate substance) and its white matter tracts (band of Broca, extracapsular thalamic peduncle, ventral amygdalohypothalamic fibers). The olfactory trigone together with diagonal gyrus and the APS proper is a relevant superficial landmark for the basal ganglia (inferior to the nucleus accumbens, lateral to the caudate head, and medial to the lentiform nucleus).; CONCLUSION: The findings in our study supplement available anatomic knowledge of APS and BF, providing reliable landmarks for precise topographic diagnosis of BF lesions and for intraoperative orientation. Surgically relevant relationships between surface and deep anatomic structures are highlighted offering thus a contribution to neurosurgeons willing to perform surgery in this delicate area.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether functional neuronavigation can be used to remove lesions in the lateral ventricle while preserving patients' neurologic functionality.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients with lateral ventricular meningiomas were divided into study and control groups (n = 30 each). Diffusion tensor and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging were used for fiber tracking and eloquent cortex localization, respectively, in the study group. The surgical approach was based on coregistered data sets from 3-D lesion and brain structure reconstructions. Patients in the control group underwent anatomic neuronavigation-guided surgery. The patients' demographics, degree of resection, visual field, language score, movement, preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores, and surgical complications were recorded.; RESULTS: Tumors were completely removed in both groups. Patients in the study group had a higher rate of visual field preservation than controls (P = 0.01). The two groups had similar motor and language functions after surgery, except that fewer cases of transient aphasia were observed in the former (P < 0.05). KPS scores for the study and control groups were 80 (70-80) and 70 (60-70), respectively (P < 0.01), at 2 weeks and 90 (80-100) and 85 (70-90), respectively (P = 0.022), at 3 months after surgery.; CONCLUSIONS: Functional neuronavigation preserved neurologic functionality and was especially beneficial for protecting optical functionality and for the rapid recovery of patients.

N2  -  We report a very rare case of Listeria multiple brain abscesses manifested as delirium, which represented diagnostic and therapeutic challenges overcome only by the close cooperation between Infectious Diseases and Neuroradiology, without which a satisfactory outcome would not be achieved.An elderly man presented with confusion and drowsiness with a background of type-II diabetes mellitus. Although computed tomography of the brain only showed frontal lobe oedema, contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed numerous irregular rim-enhancing lesions containing central diffusion restriction, suggesting multiple pyogenic cerebral abscesses of unclear aetiology. Thereafter, Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from blood cultures, suggesting this as the causative organism. Deemed unsuitable for neurosurgical drainage, the patient received medical management with a protracted course of antibiotics. This case was extremely challenging, due to 1) the impossibility of source control, 2) the small number of effective antibiotics available to treat this condition, and 3) the inevitable antibiotic side-effects, derived from long-term exposure. A successful outcome was only possible thanks to strict close multidisciplinary follow up, requiring frequent MR imaging and a judicious antibiotic choice, including monitoring of their side-effects. Due to the rarity of this condition, there is lack of guidance on its management, hence the importance of multidisciplinary involvement with very close imaging and antibiotic monitoring.

N2  -  Background: There is emerging interest in the relationship between neuroimaging location of lacunar infarcts and underlying stroke risk factors. Recent methods used for localization of lacunar infarcts are affected by high inter-rater variability. We used a novel algorithm-driven method that provided quantitative assessment of the distance of the lacunar infarct from the origins of the lenticulostriate arteries. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who presented with lacunar infarcts between 2007 and 2011. Diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were used to manually mark the infarct lesion and the ipsilateral origins of lenticulostriate arteries. A 3-dimensional distance formula computed the distance between the infarct and the arterial region of interest. All distances were adjusted for brain volumes. Agreement testing using 2 blinded assessors was used to determine reproducibility of this method. Results: One hundred and ten patients were included in our study, with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range 58-81); 67 (61%) were male and 33 (30%) had hypertension and other vascular risk factors including hypercholesterolemia 45 (41%), smoking 33 (30%), diabetes 24 (22%), ischemic heart disease 18 (16%), and atrial fibrillation 9 (8%). The agreement test for 33 patients demonstrated an intraclass correlation of .89 and Lin's correlation coefficient of.89 (95% confidence interval .816-. 963). The median distance for the study cohort was 24.5 mm, with shorter median distances of 13.7 mm observed in patients with atrial fibrillation (P value < .005). Conclusion: Our study used a novel method to calculate a distance measurement, which has high inter-rater correlation. (c) 2018 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-The penumbra of ischemic stroke consists of hypoperfused, but not irreversibly damaged, tissue surrounding the ischemic core. The purpose of this study was to determine viability thresholds in the ischemic penumbra, defined as the perfusion/diffusion mismatch in hyperacute stroke, by the use of diffusion- and perfusion- weighted MRI (DWI and PWI, respectively).
Methods-DWI and PWI were performed in 11 patients less than or equal to6 hours after the onset of symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed covering the ischemic core (ROI 1), the penumbra that progressed to infarction on the basis of follow-up scans (ROI 2), and the penumbra that recovered (ROI 3). The ratios of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), mean transit time (MTT), and apparent diffusion coefficient were calculated as lesion ROIs relative to the contralateral mirror ROIs.; Results-The post hoc analysis showed that the penumbra progressed to infarction at the following cutoff values: rCBF <0.59 and MTT >1.63. Higher sensitivity and accuracy in predicting outcome of the penumbra were obtained from the rCBF maps compared with the rCBV and MTT maps. The initial rCBV and apparent diffusion coefficient ratios did not differentiate between the part of the penumbra that recovered and the part that progressed to infarction, The mean rCBF ratio was optimal in distinguishing the parts of the penumbra recovering or progressing to infarction.; Conclusions-The thresholds found in this study by combined DWIPWI might aid in the selection of patients suitable for therapeutic intervention within 6 hours. However, these hypothesized thresholds need to be prospectively tested at the voxel level on a larger patient sample before they can be applied clinically.

N2  -  There is an increasing awareness of the involvement of thalamic connectivity on higher level cortical functioning in the human brain. This is reflected by the influence of thalamic stimulation on cortical activity and behavior as well as apparently cortical lesion syndromes occurring as a function of small thalamic insults. Here, we attempt to noninvasively test the correspondence of structural and functional connectivity of the human thalamus using diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI. Using a large sample of 102 adults, we apply tensor independent component analysis to diffusion MRI tractography data to blindly parcellate bilateral thalamus according to diffusion tractography-defined structural connectivity. Using resting-state functional MRI collected in the same subjects, we show that the resulting structurally defined thalamic regions map to spatially distinct, and anatomically predictable, whole-brain functional networks in the same subjects. Although there was significant variability in the functional connectivity patterns, the resulting 51 structural and functional patterns could broadly be reduced to a subset of 7 similar core network types. These networks were distinct from typical cortical resting-state networks. Importantly, these networks were distributed across the brain and, in a subset, map extremely well to known thalamocortico-basal-ganglial loops.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to test brain tumor interactions with brain networks, thereby identifying protective features and risk factors for memory recovery after resection.
METHODS Seventeen patients with diffuse nonenhancing glioma (ages 22 56 years) underwent longitudinal MRI before and after surgery, and during a 12 month recovery period (47 MRI scans in total after exclusion). After each scanning session, a battery of memory tests was performed using a tablet-based screening tool, including free verbal memory, overall verbal memory, episodic memory, orientation, forward digit span, and backward digit span. Using structural MRI and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) derived from diffusion weighted images, the authors estimated lesion overlap and neurite density, respectively, with brain networks derived from normative data in healthy participants (somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, frontoparietal, and default mode network DMN). Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) that regressed out the effect of age, gender, tumor grade, type of treatment, total lesion volume, and total neurite density were used to test the potential longitudinal associations between imaging markers and memory recovery.; RESULTS Memory recovery was not significantly associated with either the tumor location based on traditional lobe classification or the type of treatment received by patients (i.e., surgery alone or surgery with adjuvant chemoradio-therapy). Nonlocal effects of tumors were evident on neurite density, which was reduced not only within the tumor but also beyond the tumor boundary. In contrast, high preoperative neurite density outside the tumor but within the DMN was associated with better memory recovery (LMM, p value after false discovery rate correction P-fdr < 10(-3)). Furthermore, postoperative and follow-up neurite density within the DMN and frontoparietal network were also associated with memory recovery (LMM, P-fdr, = 0.014 and P-fdr = 0.001, respectively). Preoperative tumor and postoperative lesion overlap with the DMN showed a significant negative association with memory recovery (LMM, P-fdr = 0.002 and P-fdr < 10(-4), respectively).; CONCLUSIONS Imaging biomarkers of cognitive recovery and decline can be identified using NODDI and resting-state networks. Brain tumors and their corresponding treatment affecting brain networks that are fundamental for memory functioning such as the DMN can have a major impact on patients' memory recovery.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW

N2  -  Several studies published to date about glioma surgery have addressed the validity of using novel technologies for intraoperative guidance and potentially improved outcomes. However, most of these reports are limited by questionable methods and/or by their retrospective nature. In this work, we performed a systematic review of the literature to address the impact of intraoperative assistive technologies on the extent of resection (EOR) in glioma surgery, compared to conventional unaided surgery. We were also interested in two secondary outcome variables: functional status and progression-free survival. We primarily used PubMed to search for relevant articles. Studies were deemed eligible for our analysis if they (1) were prospective controlled studies; (2) used EOR as their primary target outcome, assessed by MRI volumetric analysis; and (3) had a homogeneous study population with clear inclusion criteria. Out of 493 publications identified in our initial search, only six matched all selection criteria for qualitative synthesis. Currently, the evidence points to 5-ALA, DTI functional neuronavigation, neurophysiological monitoring, and intraoperative MRI as the best tools for improving EOR in glioma surgery. Our sample and conclusions were limited by the fact that studies varied in terms of population characteristics and in their use of different volumetric analyses. We were also limited by the low number of prospective controlled trials available in the literature. Additional evidence-based high-quality studies assessing cost-effectiveness should be conducted to better determine the benefits of intraoperative assistive technologies in glioma surgery.

N2  -  Cerebral lesions may cause degeneration and neuroplastic reorganization in both the ipsi- and the contralesional hemisphere, presumably creating an imbalance of primarily inhibitory interhemispheric influences producedviatranscallosal pathways. The two hemispheres are thought to mutually hamper neuroplastic reorganization of the other hemisphere. The results of preceding degeneration and neuroplastic reorganization of white matter may be reflected by Diffusion Tensor Imaging-derived diffusivity parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA). In this study, we applied Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to contrast the white matter status of the contralesional hemisphere of young lesioned brains with and without contralateral influences by comparing patients after hemispherotomy to those who had not undergone neurosurgery. DTI was applied to 43 healthy controls (26 females, mean age +/- SD: 25.07 +/- 11.33 years) and two groups of in total 51 epilepsy patients with comparable juvenile brain lesions (32 females, mean age +/- SD: 25.69 +/- 12.77 years) either after hemispherotomy (30 of 51 patients) or without neurosurgery (21 of 51 patients), respectively. FA values were compared between these groups using the unbiased tract-based spatial statistics approach. A voxel-wise ANCOVA controlling for age at scan yielded significant group differences in FA. Apost hoc t-test between hemispherotomy patients and healthy controls revealed widespread supra-threshold voxels in the contralesional hemisphere of hemispherotomy patients indicating comparatively higher FA values (p< 0.05, FWE-corrected). The non-surgery group, in contrast, showed extensive supra-threshold voxels indicating lower FA values in the contralesional hemisphere as compared to healthy controls (p< 0.05, FWE-corrected). Whereas lower FA values are suggestive of pronounced contralesional degeneration in the non-surgery group, higher FA values in the hemispherotomy group may be interpreted as a result of preceding plastic remodeling. We conclude that, whether juvenile brain lesions are associated with contralesional degeneration or reorganization partly depends on the ipsilesional hemisphere. Contralesional reorganization as observed in hemispherotomy patients was most likely enabled by the complete neurosurgical deafferentation of the ipsilesional hemisphere and, thereby, the disinhibition of the neuroplastic potential of the contralesional hemisphere. The main argument of this study is that hemispherotomy may be seen as a major plastic stimulus and as a prerequisite for contralesional neuroplastic remodeling in patients with juvenile brain lesions.

N2  -  Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of changes in parameters derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that occur in response to treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Methods: 15 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme underwent serial 1.5 T MRI. Axial single-shot echo planar DTI was obtained on scans performed 3 days and 1 day prior to and 6 weeks after initiation of therapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were registered to whole brain contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient recalled and 3D fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) image volumes. Anatomic image volumes were segmented to isolate regions of interest defined by tumour-related enhancement (TRE) and FLAIR signal abnormality (FSA). Mean ADC and mean FA were calculated for each region. A Bland-Altman repeatability coefficient was also calculated for each parameter based on the two pre-treatment studies. A patient was considered to have a change in FA or ADC after therapy if the difference between the pre- and post-treatment values was greater than the repeatability coefficient for that parameter. Survival was compared using a Cox proportional hazard model.; Results: DTI detected a change in ADC within FSA after therapy in nine patients (five in whom ADC was increased; four in whom it was decreased). Patients with a change in ADC within FSA had significantly shorter overall survival (p=0.032) and progression free survival (p=0.046) than those with no change.; Conclusion: In patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan, a change in ADC after therapy in FSA is associated with decreased survival.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Our goal is to indicate the importance of combining intraoperative tractography with motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring for glioma surgery in motor eloquent areas.
METHODS: Tumor removal was performed in 28 patients with gliomas in and around the corticospinal tract (CST), in an operation theater equipped with an integrated high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and a neuronavigation system. Diffusion-tensor imaging-based tractography of the CST was implemented preoperatively and intraoperatively. When the surgically manipulated area came close to the corticospinal pathway, MEP responses were elicited by subcortical stimulation. Responsive areas were compared with the locations of fibers traced by preoperative and intraoperative tractography. Imaging and functional outcomes were reviewed.; RESULTS: Intraoperative tractography demonstrated significant inward or outward shift during surgery. MEP responses were observed around the tract at various intensities, and the distance between MEP responsive sites and intraoperative tractography was significantly correlated with the stimulation intensity (P < 0.01). The distance from preoperative tractography was not correlated. A more than subtotal resection was achieved in 24 patients (85.7%). Transient motor deterioration was seen in 12 patients (42.8%), and a permanent deficit was seen in 1 patient (3.5%).; CONCLUSIONS: We found that intraoperative tractography demonstrated the location of the CST more accurately than preoperative tractography. The results of the linear regression between distance and stimulation intensity were informative for guiding approaches to tumor remnants without impinging on the CST. The combination of intraoperative tractography and MEP monitoring can enhance the quality of surgery for gliomas in motor eloquent areas.

N2  -  Today, the role of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD) extends beyond its traditional role of excluding other conditions such as neurosurgical lesions. Modern challenges for neuroimaging techniques aim to contribute to the early diagnosis of AD. Early diagnosis includes recognition of pre-demented conditions, such as people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or with high risk of developing AD. In addition, early diagnosis would allow early treatment using currently available therapies or new therapies in the future. In this article, we will present the modern role of neuroimaging in AD. Structural MRI can detect and follow the time course of medial temporal lobe atrophy as a surrogate marker for the pathological process. New MRI techniques and image analysis software can detect subtle brain diffusion, perfusion or metabolic changes thus providing new tools for studying the pathological process. New ligands are also available for studies using tracers and positron emission tomography.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Characterization of intraoperative white matter tract (WMT) shift has the potential to compensate for neuronavigation inaccuracies using preoperative brain imaging. This study aimed to quantify and characterize intraoperative WMT shift from the global hemispheric to the regional tract-based scale and to investigate the impact of intraoperative factors (IOFs).
METHODS High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) diffusion-weighted data were acquired over 5 consecutive perioperative time points (MR1 to MR5) in 16 epilepsy patients (8 male; mean age 9.8 years, range 3.8-15.8 years) using diagnostic and intraoperative 3-T MRI scanners. MR1 was the preoperative planning scan. MR, was the first intraoperative scan acquired with the patient's head fixed in the surgical position. MR3 was the second intraoperative scan acquired following craniotomy and durotomy, prior to lesion resection. MR4 was the last intraoperative scan acquired following lesion resection, prior to wound closure. MR5 was a postoperative scan acquired at the 3-month follow-up visit. Ten association WMTWMT segments and 1 projection WMT were generated via a probabilistic tractography algorithm from each MRI scan. Image registration was performed through pairwise MRI alignments using the skull segmentation. The MR1 and MR2 pairing represented the first surgical stage. The MR2 and MR3 pairing represented the second surgical stage. The MR3 and MR4 (or MR5) pairing represented the third surgical stage. The WMT shift was quantified by measuring displacements between a pair of WMT centerlines. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses were carried out for 6 IOFs: head rotation, craniotomy size, durotomy size, resected lesion volume, presence of brain edema, and CSF loss via ventricular penetration.; RESULTS The average WMT shift in the operative hemisphere was 2.37 mm (range 1.92-3.03 mm) during the first surgibal stage, 2.19 mm (range 1.90-3.65 mm) during the second surgical stage, and 2.92 mm (range 2.19-4.32 mm) during the third surgical stage. Greater WMT shift occurred in the operative than the nonoperative hemisphere, in the WMTs adjacent to the surgical lesion rather than those remote to it, and in the superficial rather than the deep segment of the pyramidal tract. Durotomy size and resection size were significant, independent IOFs affecting WMT shift. The presence of brain edema was a marginally significant IOF. Craniotomy size, degree of head rotation, and ventricular penetration were not significant IOFs affecting WMT shift.; CONCLUSIONS WMT shift occurs noticeably in tracts adjacent to the surgical lesions, and those motor tracts superficially placed in the operative hemisphere. lntraoperative probabilistic HARDI tractography following craniotomy, durotomy, and lesion resection may compensate for intraoperative WMT shift and improve neuronavigation accuracy.

N2  -  Background and ObjectivesResearch investigating neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) outcomes have shown that combined cortical and basal ganglia infarction or involvement of the corticospinal tract predict cerebral palsy (CP). The research question was whether voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) on acute MRI can identify brain regions associated with CP and neurodevelopmental impairments in NAIS.MethodsNewborns were recruited from prospective Australian and Swiss pediatric stroke registries. CP diagnosis was based on clinical examination. Language and cognitive-behavioral impairments were assessed using the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure, dichotomized to good (0-0.5) or poor (>= 1), at >= 18 months of age. Infarcts were manually segmented using diffusion-weighted imaging, registered to a neonatal-specific brain template. VLSM was conducted using MATLAB SPM12 toolbox. A general linear model was used to correlate lesion masks with motor, language, and cognitive-behavioral outcomes. Voxel-wise t-statistics were calculated, correcting for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) rate.ResultsEighty-five newborns met the inclusion criteria. Infarct lateralization was left hemisphere (62%), right (8%), and bilateral (30%). At a median age of 2.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-2.6), 33% developed CP and 42% had neurologic impairments. Fifty-four grey and white matter regions correlated with CP (t > 4.33; FWE < 0.05), including primary motor pathway regions, such as the precentral gyrus, and cerebral peduncle, and regions functionally connected to the primary motor pathway, such as the pallidum, and corpus callosum motor segment. No significant correlations were found for language or cognitive-behavioral outcomes.DiscussionCP after NAIS correlates with infarct regions directly involved in motor control and in functionally connected regions. Areas associated with language or cognitive-behavioral impairment are less clear.

N2  -  There is a limited correlation between white matter (WM) lesion load as determined by magnetic resonance imaging and disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). The reasons for this so-called clinico-radiological paradox are diverse and may, at least partly, relate to the fact that not just the overall lesion burden, but also the exact anatomical location of lesions predict the severity and type of disability. We aimed at studying the relationship between lesion distribution and disability using a voxel-based lesion probability mapping approach in a very large dataset of MS patients. T2-weighted lesion masks of 2348 relapsing-remitting MS patients were spatially normalized to standard stereotaxic space by non-linear registration. Relations between supratentorial WM lesion locations and disability measures were assessed using a non-parametric ANCOVA (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]; Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, and subscores; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) or multinomial ordinal logistic regression (EDSS functional subscores). Data from 1907 (81%) patients were included in the analysis because of successful registration. The lesion mapping showed similar areas to be associated with the different disability scales: periventricular regions in temporal, frontal, and limbic lobes were predictive, mainly affecting the posterior thalamic radiation, the anterior, posterior, and superior parts of the corona radiata. In summary, significant associations between lesion location and clinical scores were found in periventricular areas. Such lesion clusters appear to be associated with impairment of different physical and cognitive abilities, probably because they affect commissural and long projection fibers, which are relevant WM pathways supporting many different brain functions.

N2  -  The brainstem is no longer regarded as an inoperable area, thanks to the huge advances that have been made in neurosurgery recently. Preoperative planning based on modern neuroimaging techniques (high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and helical computed tomography) and advances in microneurosurgery and neuroanesthesia allows brainstem surgery to be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Most surgically treated, space-occupying lesions in the brainstem are hematomas, and they are usually associated with cavernoma hemorrhage. However, over the last 25 years, there have also been reports from widely recognized neurosurgical centers on the positive clinical results of partial and even complete removal of brainstem tumors, mostly of glial origin. In this article, we focus on surgical planning based on neuroimaging techniques and its application for the surgical management of cavernomas, with or without hemorrhage, and focal and exophytic tumors. First of all, we review the indications for surgery of these lesions, until now almost always following imaging criteria, using the most surgically oriented classifications (especially in brainstem gliomas). In addition, we review the current controversy regarding the need for biopsy or if we can still manage them in base of imaging criteria. We also describe advances in the most significant imaging techniques in this field, emphasizing those in diffusion tensor imaging and neuronavigation. Finally, we present several cases to illustrate the role of neuroimaging in this field and to demonstrate the importance of neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons working together before and during the surgery.

N2  -  Background: Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI enables quantification of the severity of brain and cervical cord pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS).
Objective: To investigate DT MRI patterns of cervical cord damage in patients with benign MS (BMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in order to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of irreversible disability in MS.; Methods: Conventional and DT MRI scans of the cervical cord and brain were acquired from 40 BMS patients, 28 SPMS patients and 18 healthy individuals. Cervical cord and brain mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were created and average MD and FA were calculated. Cross sectional cord area (CSA) was also computed.; Results: 37 (92%) BMS patients and all (100%) SPMS patients had macroscopic cervical cord lesions. Compared with healthy individuals, BMS patients had higher average cord MD while SPMS patients had higher average cord MD, lower average cord FA and lower average CSA. Compared with BMS patients, SPMS patients had lower cord average FA and lower average CSA. In MS patients, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was correlated with CSA (r=20.47, p<0.0001), average cord FA (r=20.37, p=0.002) and brain T2 lesion volume (LV) (r=0.34, p=0.005). A multivariate regression model identified CSA, average cord FA and brain T2 LV as variables independently influencing the EDSS score (r=0.58, p<0.0001).; Conclusions: Cervical cord damage outside focal macroscopic lesions is limited in patients with BMS. The assessment of cord and brain pathology provides complementary information to improve the understanding of disability accumulation in MS.

N2  -  Our knowledge of the anatomical organization of the human brain in health and disease draws heavily on the study of patients with focal brain lesions. Historically the first method of mapping brain function, it is still potentially the most powerful, establishing the necessity of any putative neural substrate for a given function or deficit. Great inferential power, however, carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives any consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto unexamined source of such error is the structure of the high-dimensional distribution of patterns of focal damage, especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by the architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so complex that analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size cannot illuminate its structure, leaving us in the dark about the presence or absence of such error. To examine this crucial question we assembled the largest known set of focal brain lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation = 17.8, male: female ratio = 0.547), visualized with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and processed with validated automated lesion segmentation routines. High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently distort lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions from their true locations, in a manner opaque to replication. Quantifying the size of this mislocalization demonstrates that past lesion-deficit relationships estimated with conventional inferential methodology are likely to be significantly displaced, by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be retrospectively corrected, except by new knowledge that would render them redundant. Positively, we show that novel machine learning techniques employing high-dimensional inference can nonetheless accurately converge on the true locus. We conclude that current inferences about human brain function and deficits based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology that adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion data.

We aim to characterize the short-term natural cognitive recovery and brain plasticity in surgically-treated pediatric patients with LGFLT.Methods: Ten pediatric patients with LGFLT were enrolled. Their cognitive function was assessed before the surgery (S0), in the first month post-surgery (S1), and 3-6 months post-surgery (S2), using the CNS Vital Signs battery. DTI and rs-fMRI were performed during the same time periods. Changes of cognition and image metrics between S1>S0 and S2>S1 were analyzed.Results: The Motor Speed (MotSp) and Reaction Time (RT) scores significantly decreased in S1 and recovered in S2. Rs-fMRI showed decreased functional connectivity (FC) between the bilateral frontal lobes and bilateral caudates, putamina, and pallidi in S1>S0 (voxel threshold p-unc<0.001, cluster threshold p-FDR<0.05). In S2>S1, FC recovery was observed in the neighboring frontal cortex areas (p-unc<0.001, p-FDR<0.05). Among them, the FC in the caudates-right inferior frontal gyri was positively correlated to the RT (p-FDR<0.05). A DTI Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity mainly in the corticospinal tracts, cingulum, internal capsule, and external capsule at 0-6 months post-surgery (TFCE-p<0.05). The DTI metrics were not associated with the cognitive data.Conclusion: Processing speed impairment after an LGFLT resection can recover naturally within 3-6 months in school-age children. Rs-fMRI is more sensitive to short-term brain plasticity than DTI TBSS analysis. "Map expansion" plasticity in the frontal-basal ganglia circuit may contribute to the recovery.

N2  -  Purpose: Development of new therapeutic drug delivery systems is an area of significant research interest. The ability to directly target a therapeutic agent to a tumor site would minimize systemic drug exposure, thus providing the potential for increasing the therapeutic index.
Experimental Design: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the uptake of a sensitizer by the cancer cells followed by photoirradiation to activate the sensitizer. PDT using Photofrin has certain disadvantages that include prolonged cutaneous photosensitization. Delivery of nanoparticles encapsulated with photodynamic agent specifically to a tumor site could potentially overcome the drawbacks of systemic therapy. In this study, we have developed a multifunctional polymeric nanoparticle consisting of a surface-localized tumor vasculature targeting F3 peptide and encapsulated PDT and imaging agents.; Results: The nanoparticles specifically bound to the surface of MDA-435 cells in vitro and were internalized conferring photosensitivity to the cells. Significant magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement was achieved in i.c. rat 9L gliomas following i.v. nanoparticle administration. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used for determination of pharmacokinetics and distribution of nanoparticles within the tumor. Treatment of glioma-bearing rats with targeted nanoparticles followed by PDT showed a significant improvement in survival rate when compared with animals who received PDT after administration of nontargeted nanoparticles or systemic Photofrin.; Conclusions: This study reveals the versatility and efficacy of the multifunctional nanoparticle for the targeted detection and treatment of cancer.

N2  -  Background. Measures of tumor vascularity and hypoxia have been correlated with glioma grade and outcome. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI can noninvasively map tumor blood flow, vascularity, and permeability. In this prospective observational cohort pilot study, preoperative imaging was correlated with molecular markers of hypoxia, vascularity, proliferation, and progression-free and overall patient survival.
Methods. Pharmacokinetic modeling methods were used to generate maps of tumor blood flow, extraction fraction, permeability-surface area product, transfer constant, washout rate, interstitial volume, blood volume, capillary transit time, and capillary heterogeneity from preoperative DCE-MRI data in human glioma patients. Tissue was obtained from areas of peritumoral edema, active tumor, hypoxic penumbra, and necrotic core and evaluated for vascularity, proliferation, and expression of hypoxia-regulated molecules. DCE-MRI parameter values were correlated with hypoxia-regulated protein expression at tissue sample sites.; Results. Patient survival correlated with DCE parameters in 2 cases: capillary heterogeneity in active tumor and interstitial volume in areas of peritumoral edema. Statistically significant correlations were observed between several DCE parameters and tissue markers. In addition, MIB-1 index was predictive of overall survival (P = .044) and correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor expression in hypoxic penumbra (r = 0.7933, P = .0071) and peritumoral edema (r = 0.4546). Increased microvessel density correlated with worse patient outcome (P = .026).; Conclusions. Our findings suggest that DCE-MRI may facilitate noninvasive preoperative predictions of areas of tumor with increased hypoxia and proliferation. Both imaging and hypoxia biomarkers are predictive of patient outcome. This has the potential to allow unprecedented prognostic decisions and to guide therapies to specific tumor areas,

N2  -  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging of patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) does not typically reveal associated brain lesions. Here, we identify a unique group of TN patients who present with a single brainstem lesion, who do not fulfill diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). We aim to define this new clinical syndrome, which we term TN associated with solitary pontine lesion (SPL-TN), using a clinical and neuroimaging approach. We identified 24 cases of SPL-TN, 18 of which had clinical follow-up for assessment of treatment response. Lesion mapping was performed to determine the exact location of the lesions and site of maximum overlap across patients. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess the white-matter microstructural properties of the lesions. Diffusivity metrics were extracted from the (1) SPL-TN lesions, (2) contralateral, unaffected side, (3) MS brainstem plaques from 17 patients with TN secondary to MS, (4) and healthy controls. We found that 17/18 patients were nonresponders to surgical treatment. The lesions were uniformly located along the affected trigeminal pontine pathway, where the site of maximum overlap across patients was in the area of the trigeminal nucleus. The lesions demonstrated abnormal white-matter microstructure, characterized by lower fractional anisotropy, and higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivities compared with the unaffected side. The brainstem trigeminal fiber microstructure within a lesion highlighted the difference between SPL-TN lesions and MS plaques. In conclusion, SPL-TN patients have identical clinical features to TN but have a single pontine lesion not in keeping with MS and are refractory to surgical management.

N2  -  We review evidence that structural brain abnormalities are associated with abuse of amphetamines. A brief history of amphetamine use/abuse and evidence for toxicity is followed by a summary of findings from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of human subjects who had abused amphetamines and children who were exposed to amphetamines in utero. Evidence comes from studies that used a variety of techniques including manual tracing, pattern matching, voxel-based, tensor-based, or cortical thickness mapping, quantification of white matter signal hyperintensities, and diffusion tensor imaging. Ten studies compared controls to individuals who were exposed to methamphetamine. Three studies assessed individuals exposed to 3-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Brain structural abnormalities were consistently reported in amphetamine abusers, as compared to control subjects. These included lower cortical gray matter volume and higher striatal volume than control subjects. These differences might reflect brain features that could predispose to substance dependence. High striatal volumes might also reflect compensation for toxicity in the dopamine-rich basal ganglia. Prenatal exposure was associated with striatal volume that was below control values, suggesting that such compensation might not occur in utero. Several forms of white matter abnormality are also common and may involve gliosis. Many of the limitations and inconsistencies in the literature relate to techniques and cross-sectional designs, which cannot infer causality. Potential confounding influences include effects of pre existing risk/protective factors, development, gender, severity of amphetamine abuse, abuse of other drugs, abstinence, and differences in lifestyle. Longitudinal designs in which multimodal datasets are acquired and are subjected to multivariate analyses would enhance our ability to provide general conclusions regarding the associations between amphetamine abuse and brain structure.

N2  -  The optic radiation is a key white matter structure at risk during epilepsy surgery involving the temporal, parietal or occipital lobes. It shows considerable anatomical variability, cannot be delineated on clinical MRI sequences and damage may cause a disabling visual field deficit. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography allows non-invasive mapping of this pathway. Numerous methods have been published but direct comparison is difficult as patient, acquisition and analysis parameters differ.
Two methods for delineating the optic radiation were applied to 6 healthy controls and 4 patients with epileptogenic lesions near the optic radiation. By comparing methods with the same datasets, many of the parameters could be controlled. The first method was previously developed to accurately identify Meyer's loop for planning anterior temporal lobe resection. The second aimed to address limitations of this method by using a more automated technique to reduce operator time and to depict the entire optic radiation.; Whilst the core of the tract was common to both methods, there was significant variability between the methods. Method 1 gave a more consistent depiction of Meyer's loop with fewer spurious tracts. Method 2 gave a better depiction of the entire optic radiation, particularly in more posterior portions, but did not identify Meyer's loop in one patient.; These results show that whilst tractography is a promising technique, there is significant variability depending on the method chosen even when the majority of parameters are fixed. Different methods may need to be chosen for surgical planning depending on the individual clinical situation. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Previous findings have demonstrated the diagnostic usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging in depicting specific features of a brain abscess. We report a case of a cerebral abscess, which ruptured into the ventricular system, including its findings on both diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Purulent material within the left lateral ventricle, similar to that of the central abscess cavity, was strongly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images. However, variable signal intensity changes were observed on the ADC map; these probably corresponded to regional variation of the concentration of protein in the purulent material. In this case, both diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps were important and complementary in the evaluation of ventricular extension of an intracerebral abscess.

N2  -  Objective: To assess clinical symptoms, signs, and radiographic evolution of middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) diffusion restriction (DR) abnormalities following vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection. Study Design: Retrospective chart and imaging review. Setting: Tertiary-referral neurotology and neurosurgery practice. Patients: All consecutive patients who underwent translabyrinthine VS resection over a 2-year period (August 2017-May 2019). Intervention: Translabyrinthine craniotomy for VS resection. Main Outcome Measures: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained on postoperative day 1 were reviewed for DR within the pons and cerebellum, with 3 months follow-up MRI to assess for evolution of these vascular changes. Results: Of the 31 patients who met inclusion criteria, MRI demonstrated MCP DR consistent with acute ischemia in 29% (9/31). Of those, two showed corresponding T2 signal abnormalities on follow up MRI consistent with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within the MCP. Both had severe gait ataxia and dysmetria requiring acute rehabilitation admission and significantly larger tumors (p = 0.02). The remaining seven were asymptomatic, and DR abnormality resolved without lasting radiographic changes. Brainstem compression was present in 100% of patients with postoperative MCP DR (mean MCP ipsilateral:contralateral ratio 0.59 +/- 0.19), and 68.1% of those without (mean MCP ratio 0.71 +/- 0.25), a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). In the two patients with CVA, MCP asymmetry persisted, whereas the asymmetry resolved in all others. Conclusions: Asymptomatic acute MCP ischemia discovered incidentally does not require intervention. However, when the ischemic area is large and patients are symptomatic, especially if an acute rehabilitation admission is required, surgeons should suspect true CVA.

N2  -  Adult rat telecephalon was surveyed for cells demonstrating immunopositivity for muscarinic receptor (M35 antibody), microtubule-associated proteins, neurofilaments, and brain-spectrin. Neurons immunostained for muscarinic receptor were found in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital isocortex where they accounted for approximately 15-16% of all neurons. This labeling involved a large proportion of layer V pyramidal cells, some layer III pyramidal cells and a small proportion of non-pyramidal cells in layers II-VI. In the hippocampus, pyramidal cells, non-pyramidal cells and granular cells were immunoreactive, as were many pyramidal cells in subicular and entorhinal cortices. In every cortical region examined, cells demonstrating muscarinic receptor were morphologically identical to cells stained lightly to moderately for acetylcholinesterase following pretreatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate, and they were found in similar numbers and in a similar laminar distribution. These characteristics further corresponded to those of cells whose somatodendritic compartments were intensely immunostained by antibodies to microtubule-associated proteins (MAP): MAP-I, MAP-2, MAP-5; neurofilament proteins (NF): NF-68kD, NF-160kD, NF-200kD; and brain-spectrin. Double immunostaining using a fluorescence method followed by an avidin-biotin staining procedure revealed that cortical cells which possessed immunoreactivity for muscarinic receptor demonstrated an 80-85% overlap with cells that were immunoreactive for MAP-2 (and tau) or NF-200kD. Following unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis, MAP-2 immunostaining was reduced in the ipsilateral isocortex. This significant reduction was most evident in the parietal cortex, exactly where maximal loss of acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers occurred. The same lesion produced no significant difference in immunodensity of muscarinic receptor, MAP-I, MAP-5 NF-68kD, NF-160kD and NF-200kD. Thus, cortical cholinoceptive cells are enriched with cytoskeletal components and cholinergic afferents modulate cortical MAP-2.

N2  -  An arachnoid cyst is a benign lesion filled with cerebrospinal fluid that usually develops in the middle cranial fossa. The arachnoid cyst may become symptomatic if it has a large size or when it gets ruptured. Spontaneous rupture of an arachnoid cyst is a very rare complication. We report the case of an 11-year-old girl who was brought to the emergency department with a complaint of a progressive headache that was associated with vomiting. On examination, she was found to have papilledema. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed to exclude any space-occupying lesion. The scan demonstrated a right extra-axial temporal lesion, measuring 7.8 x 5.4 x 4.9 cm on maximum dimensions, along with an extension to the right cerebral convexity in a crescentic shape. The lesion follows the signal intensity of cerebrospinal fluid on all sequences and exhibited no post-contrast enhancement or restricted diffusion. The lesion exerted a mass effect in the form of compression of the right temporal lobe. These findings were consistent with an arachnoid cyst with subdural hygroma. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery team. Then, the right temporal arachnoid cyst was drained through the right temporal craniotomy and the subdural hygroma was drained through a frontal Burr hole. The patient was seen after one month in the pediatrics clinic and was completely asymptomatic.

N2  -  Objective
To determine if intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance perfusion can measure the quality of the collateral blood flow in the penumbra in hyperacute stroke.; Methods; A 6 b values IVIM MRI sequence was acquired in stroke patients with large vessel occlusion imaged <16 hours of last seen well. IVIM perfusion measures were evaluated in regions of interest drawn in the infarct core (D < 600 mm(2)s), in the corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere, and in the dynamic susceptibility contrast penumbra. In patients with a penumbra > 15 mL, images were reviewed for the presence of a penumbra perfusion lesion on the IVIM f map, which was correlated with infarct size metrics. Statistical significance was tested using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Fisher exact test.; Results; A total of 34 patients were included. In the stroke core, IVIM f was significantly lower (4.6 +- 3.3%) compared to the healthy contralateral region (6.3 +- 2.2%, p < 0.001). In the 25 patients with a penumbra > 15 mL, 9 patients had an IVIM penumbra perfusion lesion (56 +- 76 mL), and 16 did not. Patients with an IVIM penumbra perfusion lesion had a larger infarct core (82 +- 84 mL) at baseline, a larger infarct growth (68 +- 40 mL), and a larger final infarct size (126 +- 81 mL) on follow-up images compared to the patients without (resp. 20 +- 17 mL, p < 0.05; 13 +- 19 mL, p < 0.01; 29 +- 24 mL, p < 0.05). All IVIM penumbra perfusion lesions progressed to infarction despite thrombectomy treatment.; Conclusions; IVIM is a promising tool to assess the quality of the collateral blood flow in hyperacute stroke. IVIM penumbra perfusion lesion may be a marker of nonsalvageable tissue despite treatment with thrombectomy, suggesting that the IVIM penumbra perfusion lesion might be counted to the stroke core, together with the DWI lesion.

N2  -  Last year was the 150th anniversary of Paul Broca's landmark case report on speech disorder that paved the way for subsequent studies of cortical localization of higher cognitive functions. However, many complex functions rely on the activity of distributed networks rather than single cortical areas. Hence, it is important to understand how brain regions are linked within large-scale networks and to map lesions onto connecting white matter tracts. To facilitate this network approach we provide a synopsis of classical neurological syndromes associated with frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal and limbic lesions. A review of tractography studies in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders is also included. The synopsis is accompanied by a new atlas of the human white matter connections based on diffusion tensor tractography freely downloadable on http://www.natbrainlab.com. Clinicians can use the maps to accurately identify the tract affected by lesions visible on conventional CT or MRI. The atlas will also assist researchers to interpret their group analysis results. We hope that the synopsis and the atlas by allowing a precise localization of white matter lesions and associated symptoms will facilitate future work on the functional correlates of human neural networks as derived from the study of clinical populations. Our goal is to stimulate clinicians to develop a critical approach to clinico-anatomical correlative studies and broaden their view of clinical anatomy beyond the cortical surface in order to encompass the dysfunction related to connecting pathways.

N2  -  Object. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging tractography is increasingly used to map fiber tracts in patients with surgical brain lesions to reduce the risk of postoperative functional deficit. There are few validation studies of DT imaging tractography in these patients. The aim of this study was to compare DT imaging tractography of language fiber tracts by using intraoperative subcortical electrical stimulations.
Methods. The authors included 10 patients with low-grade gliomas or dysplasia located in language areas. The MR imaging examination included 3D T1-weighted images for anatomical coregistration, FLAIR, and DT images. Diffusion tensors and fiber tracts were calculated using in-house software. Four tracts were reconstructed in each patient including the arcuate fasciculus, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and 2 premotor fasciculi ( the subcallosal medialis fiber tract and cortical fibers originating from the medial and lateral premotor areas). The authors compared fiber tracts reconstructed using DT imaging with those evidenced using intraoperative subcortical language mapping.; Results. Seventeen (81%) of 21 positive stimulations were concordant with DT imaging fiber bundles ( located within 6 mm of a fiber tract). Four positive stimulations were not located in the vicinity of a DT imaging fiber tract. Stimulations of the arcuate fasciculus mostly induced articulatory and phonemicsyntactic disorders and less frequently semantic paraphasias. Stimulations of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus induced semantic paraphasias. Stimulations of the premotor-related fasciculi induced dysarthria and articulatory planning deficit.; Conclusions. There was a good correspondence between positive stimulation sites and fiber tracts, suggesting that DT imaging fiber tracking is a reliable technique but not yet optimal to map language tracts in patients with brain lesions. Negative tractography does not rule out the persistence of a fiber tract, especially when invaded by the tumor. Stimulations of the different tracts induced variable language disorders that were specific to each fiber tract. (DOI: 10.31712009.8.JNS09558)

N2  -  White matter (WM) lesions have been recognized as a key etiological factor in geriatric depression. However, little is known about the topological pattern changes of WM in geriatric depression in the remitted state (RGD) and its relationship to depressive episodes. To address these questions, we acquired diffusion tensor images in 24 RGD and 24 healthy participants. Among them, 10 patients and 19 healthy controls completed a 1-year follow up. Between-hemisphere connectivity and graph theoretical methods were used to analyze the data. We found significantly reduced WM connectivity between the left and right hemisphere in the RGD group compared with the control group. Those with multiple depression episodes had greater reduction in between-hemisphere connectivity strength than those with fewer episodes. In addition, the RGD group had a reduced global clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and network strength, and an increased shortest path length compared with the controls. A lower clustering coefficient was correlated with poorer memory function. The reduction of nodal clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and network strength in several regions were associated with slower information processing speed. At 1-year follow up, the network properties in the RGD subjects were significantly changed suggesting instability of WM network properties of depressed patients. Together, our study provides direct evidence of reduced between-hemisphere WM connectivity with greater depressive episodes, and of alterations of network properties with cognitive dysfunction in geriatric depression.

N2  -  Rab3A is a small GTP-binding synaptic vesicle protein, shown to dissociate from synaptic vesicle membranes upon depolarization-induced exocytosis. Using an antiserum raised against rab3A, we found that the antigen was localized to the neuropil of specific brain regions. but was not present in major fiber tracts or most cell bodies. For example, the neuropil of several thalamic nuclei (i.e., dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, ventroposterior nucleus), cerebral cortex, upper layers of the superior colliculus and matrix zones of the neostriatum, were strongly immunoreactive, while the anterior commissure. corpus callosum, optic tract and internal capsule were devoid of staining. The hippocampus, regions of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum exhibited striking laminar distributions of rab3A immunoreactivity. In the hippocampus, dark staining was observed in the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, while the pyramidal, stratum lacunosum moleculare and dentate granule layers were not stained. In cerebellum the molecular layer and to a lesser extent, the underlying granule cell layer showed enhanced immunoreactivity. Seven days after excitotoxic lesions of the cerebral cortex, rab3A immunoreactivity was diminished in the mirror locus in the contralateral cortical hemisphere and in certain thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the injection site. These results show that rab3A is localized to a number of specific regions. Its absence from other areas suggests that this synaptic vesicle protein is not universal to all neuronal terminals and pathways. In addition, our lesion studies indicate that for some brain regions, much of the antigen originates in cortical neurons and is distributed within specific axonal projections.

N2  -  The frontal aslant tract (FAT) is a recently described major connection between the preSMA and Broca's area, whose functional role remains undefined. In this study we examined a patient presenting a morphological overregularization strategy in a verb generation task during awake surgery. This specific language deficit coincided with brain tumor resection at the level of the left FAT. During the task execution the patient formed the non-existent verbs by applying a morphological derivation rule to the given nouns, instead of retrieving the appropriate verbs. DTI results confirmed left FAT damage. Neuropsychological follow-up showed that this morphological derivation impairment partially persisted after surgery, whereas the results on a wide spectrum of other language-related tasks remained satisfactory. Additionally, we compared the pre- and the post-operational fMRI activation maps for the same verb generation task. We discuss the potential role of the left FAT in the morphological derivation process and in lexical retrieval. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective: Predicting outcome in patients with primary intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in the acute stage can provide information to determine the best therapeutic and rehabilitation strategies. We prospectively investigated the predictive value of the functional diffusion map (fDM) in the acute stage of ICH.
Methods: 47 patients with ICH were enrolled for clinical evaluation and MRI within 24 h of symptom onset and 5 days after ICH. Functional diffusion mapping prospectively monitored the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of perihaematomal oedema. Consequently, the change in perihaematomal oedema was classified into three categories: increased, decreased, or no significant change. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 6 months after ICH according to the modified Rankin Scale. Correlation between clinical outcome and the fDMs was performed.; Results: Among the clinical variables, thalamic haematoma, serum glucose level and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly different between the good-and poor-outcome groups. The percentage of oedematous tissue undergoing significant change between baseline and Day 5 was also significantly different between the groups.; Conclusion: fDMs allow for spatial voxel-by-voxel tracking of changes in ADC values. It may be feasible to use fDMs to predict the functional outcome of patients with ICH during the acute stage.; Advances in knowledge: The use of fDMs for stroke study is demonstrated. fDMs may be more suitable to reflect the pathophysiological heterogeneity within oedemas and may facilitate another thinking process for imaging study of stroke and other neurological diseases.

N2  -  For gliomas, the goal of surgery is to maximise the extent of resection (EOR) while minimising the postoperative morbidity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits of a protocol developed for the surgical management of gliomas located in language areas, where tractography-integrated navigation was used in conjunction with direct electrical stimulations (DES).
The authors included ten patients suffering of gliomas located in language areas. The preoperative planning for multimodal navigation was done by integrating anatomical magnetic resonance images and subcortical pathway volumes generated by diffusion tensor imaging. Six white matter fascicles implicated in language functions were reconstructed in each patient, including fibres for phonological processing (i.e. the arcuate fasciculus), fibres for lexical-semantic processing (i.e. the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus), and two premotor fasciculi involved in the preparation of speech movements (the subcallosal medialis fasciculus and cortical fibres originating from the medial and lateral premotor areas). During surgery, language fascicles were identified by direct visualisation on tractography-integrated navigation images and by observing transient language inhibition after subcortical DES. Language deficits were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, and compared with the EOR.; Tractography was successfully performed in all patients, preoperatively demonstrating the relationships between the tumours to resect and the language fascicles to preserve from injury. With the use of the tractography-integrated navigation system and intraoperative DES, language functions were preserved in all patients. The mean volumetric resection was 93.0 +- 10.4 % of the preoperative tumour volume, with a gross total resection in 60 % of patients.; The intraoperative combination of tractography and DES contributed to maximum safe resection of gliomas located in language areas.

N2  -  Background Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can noninvasively estimate the perfusion and function of the brain. Purpose To investigate the perfusion and functional status using rs-fMRI in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients after reperfusion therapy. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Twenty-five AIS patients who underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) upon hospital admission and both rs-fMRI and DSC scans at 24 hours after reperfusion therapy. Field Strength/Sequence 3T; DSC, rs-fMRI. Assessment The time delay of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal was calculated using time-shift-analysis (TSA) and compared with the time to peak (TTP) derived from the DSC. For patients who exhibited partial or complete reperfusion in the supratentorial hemisphere, we quantified the function of different regions (healthy tissue, reperfused tissue, not reperfused tissue) by using three rs-fMRI measurements (functional connectivity, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation [ALFF] and regional homogeneity [ReHo]). Correlations between the functional measurements and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were calculated. Statistical Tests Dice coefficient (DC) analysis, two-sample t-tests, Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Twelve patients who exhibited complete reperfusion on their TTP maps showed no time-delayed areas on the TSA maps. For the remaining 13 patients with partial reperfusion (5/13) or no reperfusion (8/13) on the TTP maps, the TSA detected comparable time-delayed areas. Eleven out of 13 patients showed moderate to good overlap (mean DC, 0.58 +/- 0.1) between the TTP and TSA results. Fourteen patients were chosen for functional analyses and most patients (12/14) showed abnormal functional connectivity in the reperfused regions. The reperfused and not reperfused tissues had lower mean ReHo values than those of the healthy tissue (both P < 0.001). The mRS scores showed negative correlation with mean ReHo values of reperfused region (R = -0.523, P = 0.027). Data Conclusion rs-fMRI might be a useful way to estimate both the perfusion and functional status for AIS patients after reperfusion therapy. Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J. Magn. Reson.

We observed high levels of immunostaining of L-type Ca2+ channels in odontoblast cell bodies and their processes, in fibroblast cell bodies and in Schwann cells. Many Ca(v)1.2-containing unmyelinated and myelinated axons were also present in root nerves and proximal branches in coronal pulp, but were usually missing from nerve fibers in dentin. Labeling in the larger fibers was present along the axonal membrane, localized in axonal vesicles, and in nodal regions. After focal tooth injury, there is a marked loss of Ca(v)1.2 channels in injured teeth. Immunostaining of Ca(v)1.2 channels was lost selectively in nerve fibers and local cells of the tooth pulp within 10 min of the lesion, without loss of other Ca-v channel or pulpal labels. By 60 min, Ca(v)1.2 channels in odontoblasts were detected again but at levels below controls, whereas fibroblasts were labeled well above control levels, similar to upregulation of Ca(v)1.2 channels in astrocytes after injury. By 3 days after the injury, Ca(v)1.2 channels were again detected in nerve fibers and immunostaining of fibroblasts and odontoblasts had returned to control levels. These findings provide new insight into the localization of Ca(v)1.2 channels in dental pulp and sensory fibers, and demonstrate unexpected plasticity of channel distribution in response to nerve injury.

N2  -  Background: Primary intracranial Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET) is an extremely uncommon tumor. Care should be taken as it can be mistaken for a meningioma radiologically.
Case description: This paper reports a case of a 44-year-old male presenting with headache. A magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass involving the tentorium, cerebrum and cerebellum with solid-cystic component. The solid component was hyperintense on T1-weighted images with significant enhancement. There was restriction in diffusion-weighted images and microhemorrhagic signal change in susceptibility weighted images. MR perfusion revealed increased relative cerebral blood volume and mean transit time values. Surgical pathology was reported as ES.; Conclusions: Intracranial ESpPNET is a rare tumor that generally arises from the meninges. It must be distinguished from meningioma since it can be mistaken radiologically, because the treatment and prognosis are quite different. Localization and conventional MR signal characteristics of both lesions are similar. Whereas, MR perfusion findings may be helpful in discrimination.

N2  -  Brain tumours located in or in proximity to eloquent areas are a significant neurosurgical challenge. Performing this kind of surgery with neurophysiological monitoring to improve resections with reduced permanent focal neurological deficit has become widely accepted in the literature. However, how to conduct this monitoring, the exact definition of an eloquent area and whether to perform this surgery with the patient awake or asleep are still subject to rigorous scientific debate.
Members of the Neuro-oncology Working Group (GTNO) of the Spanish Society of Neurosurgery (SENEC) and members of the Spanish Society of Clinical Neurophysiology (SENFC) have published a consensus statement to explain the different neurophysiological monitoring options currently available in awake and asleep patients to obtain better surgical resection without neurological deficits. An exhaustive review of the literature has also been conducted. (C) 2017 Sociedad Espanola de Neurocirugia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The authors sought to demonstrate that hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic lesions is the main cause of delayed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after Pipeline embolization device (PED) treatment and to estimate the rate of hemorrhagic transformation of new postprocedure ischemic lesions.
METHODS Patients who underwent PED placement (PED group) from November 2015 to March 2017 or stent-mediated embolization (EN group) from December 2010 to October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Pre-and postprocedural MR images and 6-month follow-up MR images for each patient were scored for the presence of postprocedural bland ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and T2*-weighted MRI (T2* WI), respectively.; RESULTS The PED group comprised 28 patients with 30 intracranial aneurysms, and the EN group comprised 24 patients with 27 intracranial aneurysms. The mean number of ischemic lesions on DWI 1 day postprocedure was higher in the PED group than in the EN group (5.2 vs 2.7, p = 0.0010). The mean number of microbleeds detected on T2* WI 6 months postprocedure was higher in the PED group than in the EN group (0.6 vs 0.15, p = 0.028). A total of 36.7% of PED-treated patients exhibited new microbleeds on T2* WI at 6 months postprocedure, with at least 77.8% of these lesions representing hemorrhagic transformations of the new ischemic lesions observed on day 1 postprocedure. The rate of adjunctive coil embolization (27.3% vs 0.0%, p = 0.016) and the mean number of ischemic lesions observed 1 day postprocedure (6.6 vs 4.3, p = 0.020) were predictors of subsequent microbleeds in the PED group.; CONCLUSIONS New microbleeds detected using T2* WI at 6 months postprocedure were more common after PED treatment than after stent-mediated embolization. Approximately three-quarters of these lesions were hemorrhagic transformations of new ischemic lesions observed on day 1 postprocedure. Prevention of intraprocedural or postprocedural infarcts is necessary to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications following PED placement.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Diffusion MRI has uniquely enabled in vivo delineation of white matter tracts, which has been applied to the segmentation of eloquent pathways for intraoperative mapping. The last decade has also seen the development from earlier diffusion tensor models to higher-order models, which take advantage of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) techniques. However, these advanced methods have not been widely implemented for routine preoperative and intraoperative mapping.
The authors report on the application of residual bootstrap q-ball fiber tracking for routine mapping of potentially functional language pathways, the development of a system for rating tract injury to evaluate the impact on clinically assessed language function, and initial results predicting long-term language deficits following glioma resection.; METHODS The authors have developed methods for the segmentation of 8 putative language pathways including dorsal phonological pathways and ventral semantic streams using residual bootstrap q-ball fiber tracking. Furthermore, they have implemented, clinically feasible preoperative acquisition and processing of HARDI data to delineate these pathways for neurosurgical application. They have also developed a rating scale based on the altered fiber tract density to estimate the degree of pathway injury, applying these ratings to a subset of 35 patients with pre- and postoperative fiber tracking. The relationships between specific pathways and clinical language deficits were assessed to determine which pathways are predictive of long-term language deficits following surgery.; RESULTS This tracking methodology has been routinely implemented for preoperative mapping in patients with brain gliomas who have undergone awake brain tumor resection at the University of California, San Francisco (more than 300 patients to date). In this particular study the authors investigated the white matter structure status and language correlation in a subcohort of 35 subjects both pre- and postsurgery. The rating scales developed for fiber pathway damage were found to be highly reproducible and provided significant correlations with language performance. Preservation of the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the temporoparietal component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-tp) was consistent in all patients without language deficits (p < 0.001) at the long-term follow-up. Furthermore, in patients with short-term language deficits, the AF andor SLF-tp were affected, and damage to these 2 pathways was predictive of a long-term language deficit (p = 0.005).; CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrated the successful application of q-ball tracking in presurgical planning for language pathways in brain tumor patients and in assessing white matter tract integrity postoperatively to predict long-term language dysfunction. These initial results predicting long-term language deficits following tumor resection indicate that postoperative injury to dorsal language pathways may be prognostic for long-term clinical language deficits.; Study results suggest the importance of dorsal stream tract preservation to reduce language deficits in patients undergoing glioma resection, as well as the potential prognostic value of assessing postoperative injury to dorsal language pathways to predict long-term clinical language deficits.

N2  -  Objectives: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly infiltrative primary brain tumour with an aggressive clinical course. Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is a recently developed technique capable of visualising subclinical tumour spread into adjacent brain tissue. Tensor decomposition through p and q maps can be used for planning of treatment. Our objective was to develop a tool to automate the segmentation of DTI decomposed p and q maps in GBM patients in order to inform construction of radiotherapy target volumes.
Methods: Chan-Vese level set model is applied to segment the p map using the q map as its initial starting point. The reason of choosing this model is because of the robustness of this model on either conventional MRI or only DTI. The method was applied on a data set consisting of 50 patients having their gross tumour volume delineated on their q map and Chan-Vese level set model uses these superimposed masks to incorporate the infiltrative edges.; Results: The expansion of tumour boundary from q map to p map is clearly visible in all cases and the Dice coefficient (DC) showed a mean similarity of 74% across all 50 patients between the manually segmented ground truth p map and the level set automatic segmentation.; Conclusion: Automated segmentation of the tumour infiltration boundary using DTI and tensor decomposition is possible using Chan-Vese level set methods to expand q map to p map. We have provided initial validation of this technique against manual contours performed by experienced clinicians.; Advances in knowledge: This novel automated technique to generate p maps has the potential to individualise radiation treatment volumes and act as a decision support tool for the treating oncologist.

N2  -  Background and Purpose- Lacunar strokes are subcortical infarcts with small size and high disability rates, largely due to injury of the corticospinal tract in the internal capsule (IC). Current rodent models of lacunar infarcts are created based on stereotactic coordinates. We tested the hypothesis that better understanding of the somatotopy of the IC and guiding the lesion with electrical stimulation would allow a more accurate lesion to the forelimb axons of the IC. Methods- We performed electrophysiological motor mapping and viral tracing to define the somatotopy of the IC of Sprague Dawley rats. For the lesion, we used an optrode, which contains an electrode to localize forelimb responses and an optical fiber to deliver light. The infarct was induced when light activated the photothrombotic agent Rose Bengal, which was administered systemically. Results- We found largely a separate distribution of the forelimb and hindlimb axons in the IC, both by microstimulation mapping and tract tracing. Microstimulation-guided IC lesions ablated the forelimb axons of the IC in rats and caused lasting forelimb impairments while largely preserving the hindlimb axons of the IC and surrounding gray matter. Conclusions- Stimulation guidance enabled selective and reproducible infarcts of the forelimb axons of the IC in rats.

N2  -  Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to predict the grades of cerebral gliomas using quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.
Materials and methods: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was performed up to 8, 2016. The quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS 2) was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Statistical analyses included pooling of sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio' (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and diagnostic accuracy values of the included studies using the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC). All analyses were conducted using STATA (version 12.0), RevMan (version 5.3), and Meta-Disc 1.4 software programs.; Results: Fifteen studies were analyzed and included a total of 821 patients and 821 lesions. In regards to the diagnostic accuracy of ADC maps, the pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR, and DOR with 95%Cls were 0.85(95%Cl: 0.80, 0.90)and 0.80 (95%0: 0.71, 0.87),34.25(95%CI: 2.96, 6.09), 0.18(95%0:0.13.0.25), and 23.14(95%CI: 14.73, 36.36), respectively. The SROC curve showed an AUC of 0.90. Deeks testing confirmed no significant publication bias in all studies.; Conclusion: Our findings indicate that quantitative ADC values have high accuracy in separating high-grade from low-grade cerebral gliomas. Further studies using a standardized methodology may help guide the use of ADC values for clinical decision-making. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Solitary large brain metastases (LBM) and high-grade gliomas (HGG) are sometimes hard to differentiate on MRI. The management differs significantly between these two entities, and non-invasive methods that help differentiate between them are eagerly needed to avoid potentially morbid biopsies and surgical procedures. We explore herein the performance and interpretability of an MRI-radiomics variational quantum neural network (QNN) using a quantum-annealing mutual-information (MI) feature selection approach. We retrospectively included 423 patients with HGG and LBM (> 2 cm) who had a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1) MRI between 2012 and 2019. After exclusion, 72 HGG and 129 LBM were kept. Tumors were manually segmented, and a 5-mm peri-tumoral ring was created. MRI images were pre-processed, and 1813 radiomic features were extracted. A set of best features based on MI was selected. MI and conditional-MI were embedded into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation that was mapped to an Ising-model and submitted to D'Wave's quantum annealer to solve for the best combination of 10 features. The 10 selected features were embedded into a 2-qubits QNN using PennyLane library. The model was evaluated for balanced-accuracy (bACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) on the test set. The model performance was benchmarked against two classical models: dense neural networks (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Shapley values were calculated to interpret sample-wise predictions on the test set. The best 10-feature combination included 6 tumor and 4 ring features. For QNN, DNN, and XGB, respectively, training ROC-AUC was 0.86, 0.95, and 0.94; test ROC-AUC was 0.76, 0.75, and 0.79; and test bACC was 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72. The two most influential features were tumor Laplacian-of-Gaussian-GLRLM-Entropy and sphericity. We developed an accurate interpretable QNN model with quantum-informed feature selection to differentiate between LBM and HGG on CE-T1 brain MRI. The model performance is comparable to state-of-the-art classical models.

N2  -  Background: Segmentation of gliomas in multi-parametric (MP-)MR images is challenging due to their heterogeneous nature in terms of size, appearance and location. Manual tumor segmentation is a time-consuming task and clinical practice would benefit from (semi-) automated segmentation of the different tumor compartments.
Methods: We present a semi-automated framework for brain tumor segmentation based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) that does not require prior training of the method. L1-regularization is incorporated into the NMF objective function to promote spatial consistency and sparseness of the tissue abundance maps. The pathological sources are initialized through user-defined voxel selection. Knowledge about the spatial location of the selected voxels is combined with tissue adjacency constraints in a post-processing step to enhance segmentation quality. The method is applied to an MP-MRI dataset of 21 high-grade glioma patients, including conventional, perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. To assess the effect of using MP-MRI data and the L1-regularization term, analyses are also run using only conventional MRI and without L1-regularization. Robustness against user input variability is verified by considering the statistical distribution of the segmentation results when repeatedly analyzing each patient's dataset with a different set of random seeding points.; Results: Using L1-regularized semi-automated NMF segmentation, mean Dice-scores of 65%, 74 and 80% are found for active tumor, the tumor core and the whole tumor region. Mean Hausdorff distances of 6.1 mm, 7.4 mm and 8.2 mm are found for active tumor, the tumor core and the whole tumor region. Lower Dice-scores and higher Hausdorff distances are found without L1-regularization and when only considering conventional MRI data.; Conclusions: Based on the mean Dice-scores and Hausdorff distances, segmentation results are competitive with state-of-the-art in literature. Robust results were found for most patients, although careful voxel selection is mandatory to avoid sub-optimal segmentation.

N2  -  Electrical properties (EP), namely conductivity and permittivity, can provide endogenous contrast for tissue characterization. Using electrical property tomography (EPT), maps of EP can be generated from conventional MRI data. This report investigates the feasibility and accuracy of EPT at 21.1 T for multiple RF coils and modes of operation using phantoms. Additionally, it demonstrates the EP of the in vivo rat brain with and without ischemia.
Helmholtz-based EPT was implemented in its Full-form, which demands the complex field, and a simplified form requiring either just the field phase for conductivity or the field magnitude for permittivity. Experiments were conducted at 21.1 T using birdcage and saddle coils operated in linear or quadrature transceive mode, respectively. EPT approaches were evaluated using a phantom, ex and in vivo Sprague-Dawley rats under naive conditions and ischemic stroke via transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.; Different conductivity reconstruction approaches applied to the phantom displayed average errors of 12%-73% to the target acquired from dielectric probe measurements. Permittivity reconstructions showed higher agreement and an average 3%-8% error to the target depending on reconstruction approach. Conductivity and permittivity of ex and in vivo rodent brain were measured. Elevated EP in the ischemia region correlated with the increased sodium content and the influx of water intracellularly following ischemia in the lesion were detected.; The Full-form technique generated from the linear birdcage provided the best accuracy for EP of the phantom. Phase-based conductivity and magnitude-based permittivity mapping provided reasonable estimates but also demonstrated the limitations of Helmholtz-based EPT at 21.1 T. Permittivity reconstruction was improved significantly over lower fields, suggesting a novel metric for in vivo brain studies. EPT applied to ischemic rat brain proved sensitivity to physiological changes, motivating the future application of more advanced reconstruction approaches.

N2  -  The cerebellum is a complex system with distinct cortical laminar organization. Alterations in cerebellar microstructure are common and associated with many factors such as genetics, cancer and ageing. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a non-invasive tool to map the brain structural organization, and the recently proposed diffusion-time (td)-dependent dMRI further improves its capability to probe the cellular and axonal/dendritic microstructures by measuring water diffusion at multiple spatial scales. The t(d)-dependent diffusion profile in the cerebellum and its utility in detecting cerebellar disorders, however, are not yet elucidated. Here, we first deciphered the spatial correspondence between dMRI contrast and cerebellar layers, based on which the cerebellar layerspecific td-dependent dMRI patterns were characterized in both euploid and Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of Down syndrome. Using oscillating gradient dMRI, which accesses diffusion at short t(d)'s by modulating the oscillating frequency, we detected subtle changes in the apparent diffusivity coefficient of the cerebellar internal granular layer and Purkinje cell layer of Ts65Dn mice that were not detectable by conventional pulsed gradient dMRI. The detection sensitivity of oscillating gradient dMRI increased with the oscillating frequency at both the neonatal and adult stages. The t(d)-dependence, quantified by Delta ADC map, was reduced in Ts65Dn mice, likely associated with the reduced granule cell density and abnormal dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells as revealed from histological evidence. Our study demonstrates superior sensitivity of short-td diffusion using oscillating gradient dMRI to detect cerebellar microstructural changes in Down syndrome, suggesting the potential application of this technique in cerebellar disorders.

N2  -  Background: Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction is a devastating condition, with up to 80% mortality in conservatively treated patients. The pathophysiology of this stroke is characterized by a large core of severe ischemia and only a relatively small rim of penumbra. Due to the fast development of irreversible morphological damage, cytotoxic edema occurs immediately in a large portion of the ischemic territory. The subsequent damage of the tight junctions leads to the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and vasogenic brain edema, resulting in space-occupying brain swelling. The progressive vasogenic edema reaches its maximum after 1 to several days and exerts a mechanical force on surrounding tissue structures leading to midline shift and transtentorial herniation and finally brain stem compression and death. Summary: Early severe neurological symptoms hemiparesis, gaze deviation, higher cortical signs - followed by headache, vomiting, papillo edema and reduced consciousness may predict the deleterious course. Imaging supports the suspected diagnosis with hypodense changes on CT extending beyond 50% of the MCA territory. The size of the probably infarcted tissue and a midline shift on CT as well as the size of the lesion on diffusion-weighted MRI are predictive of a malignant course. Reduction of cerebral blood flow below a critical value and volume of irreversible tissue damage detected by positron emission tomography in the early hours after the stroke are indicative of progression to malignant infarction with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and decreased tissue oxygen tension observed by multimodal neuromonitoring in the later course. Treatment options of malignant infarction include general measures to limit the extent of space-occupying edema, but these therapies have not been efficacious. Only surgical intervention with decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) was successful in relieving the effects of increased ICP and of the deleterious shifts of brain tissue. Several controlled clinical trials have proven the efficacy of DHC with a significant decrease in mortality and improved functional outcome. However, DHC must be performed early and with a large diameter, regardless of the age of patients, but in patients beyond 60 years, the higher likelihood of resulting severe disability should be taken into consideration. Key Messages: Malignant MCA infarction can be predicted early with a high sensitivity by neuroimaging. The early diagnosis is mandatory for DHC, which was shown to reduce mortality and improve functional outcome in several controlled clinical trials. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  Laughter has a major role in daily social interactions; consequently, its biologic bases have been previously studied. Nevertheless, its cerebral representation remains unclear. The most accepted hypothesis has postulated that laughter has 2 components: mirth, related to the temporal and frontal neocortical areas, and motor aspect, related to the limbic system and brainstem. Furthermore, in prior studies, laughter has been elicited during electric stimulation with depth electrodes in the supplementary motor area and the cingulum. This Video 1 reports resection of a right superior frontal gyrus diffuse astrocytoma (isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant, World Health Organization grade II) with awake intraoperative electric cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography, including all the tracts in relation to the tumor, was obtained preoperatively and postoperatively. Stimulation of the cingulum medially and inferiorly to the tumor elicited a patient's smile and laugh without mirth or merriment. Also, this point correlated with the reconstructed cingulum in the intraoperatively navigated DTI tractography. In conclusion, these findings support the anatomic subdivision of the laughter's mechanism and the role of the cingulum in its motor component. Furthermore, smiles and laughter could be useful functional landmarks to identify the cingulum during subcortical mapping. Although it remains unclear whether pursuing resection beyond this point would have caused permanent postoperative deficits, considering laughter's role in social interaction and other emotion-processing functions associated with the cingulum, in the future it could be potentially considered a functional limit of the resection of intrinsic tumors.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: To reduce the risk of disabling postoperative functional deficit in patients with lesions in the dominant hemisphere, information about the localization of eloquent language areas is mandatory.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of arcuate fascicle (AF) tractography for proper localization of eloquent language areas in the superior temporal (STG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG).; METHODS: Between January and June 2010, we performed surgery in 13 patients with highly eloquent lesions with close spatial relationship to the primary language areas. All of them received preoperative diffusion tensor imaging for AF tractography. The STG and IFG were delineated at the ends of the AF. Five patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the primary language areas. The results were compared with tractography.; RESULTS: Tractography of the AF without prior knowledge of the localization of the STG and IFG was feasible in all cases. In the cases with functional magnetic resonance imaging, the activation maps matched the tractography results. In all but 1 patient, preservation of the primary language areas was possible, proven by the good neurological outcome. One patient suffered from a language dysfunction caused by a lesion in the medial and inferior temporal gyrus along the surgical pathway.; CONCLUSION: Tractography of the AF is a useful tool for identification of parts of the main primary language areas. Using tractography as a localization procedure to determine the primary language areas aids in the delineation of the STG and IFG and thus may help reduce the risk of postoperative permanent neurological deficit.

N2  -  Purpose The authors' purpose was to create a valid multiparametric MRI model for the differential diagnosis between glioblastoma and solitary brain metastasis. Materials and methods Forty-one patients (twenty glioblastomas and twenty-one brain metastases) were retrospectively evaluated. MRIs were analyzed with Olea Sphere(R) 3.0. Lesions' volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn on enhanced 3D T1 MP-RAGE and projected on ADC and rCBV co-registered maps. Another two VOIs were drawn in the region of hyperintense cerebral edema, surrounding the lesion, respectively, within 5 mm around the enhancing tumor and into residual edema. Perfusion curves were obtained, and the value of signal recovery (SR) was reported. A two-sample T test was obtained to compare all parameters of GB and BM groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed. Results According to ROC analysis, the area under the curve was 88%, 78% and 74%, respectively, for mean ADC VOI values of the solid component, the mean and max rCBV values in the perilesional edema and the PSR. The cumulative ROC curve of these parameters reached an area under the curve of 95%. Using perilesional max rCBV > 1.37, PSR > 75% and mean lesional ADC < 1 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) GB could be differentiated from solitary BM (sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 86%). Conclusion Lower values of ADC in the enhancing tumor, a higher percentage of SR in perfusion curves and higher values of rCBV in the peritumoral edema closed to the lesion are strongly indicative of GB than solitary BM.

N2  -  Aims: Multimodal computed tomography (mCT) (non-contrast CT, CT angiography, and CT perfusion) is not routinely used to assess posterior fossa strokes. We described the area under the curve (AUC) of brain NCCT, WB-CTP automated core-penumbra maps and comprehensive CTP analysis (automated core-penumbra maps and all perfusion maps) for posterior fossa strokes.
Methods: We included consecutive patients with signs and symptoms of posterior fossa stroke who underwent acute mCT and follow up magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Multimodal CT images were reviewed blindly and independently by two stroke neurologists and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare imaging modalities.; Results: From January 2014 to December 2019, 83 patients presented with symptoms suggestive of posterior fossa strokes and had complete imaging suitable for inclusion (49 posterior fossa strokes and 34 DWI negative patients). For posterior fossa strokes, comprehensive CTP analysis had an AUC of 0.68 vs. 0.62 for automated core-penumbra maps and 0.55 for NCCT. For cerebellar lesions >5 mL, the AUC was 0.87, 0.81, and 0.66, respectively.; Conclusion: Comprehensive CTP analysis increases the detection of posterior fossa lesions compared to NCCT and should be implemented as part of the routine imaging assessment in posterior fossa strokes.

N2  -  The primary lesion arising from the initial insult after traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of secondary tissue damage, which may also progress to connected brain areas in the chronic phase. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate variations in the susceptibility distribution related to these secondary tissue changes in a rat model after severe lateral fluid percussion injury. We compared quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R-2* measurements with histological analyses in white and grey matter areas outside the primary lesion but connected to the lesion site. We demonstrate that susceptibility variations in white and grey matter areas could be attributed to reduction in myelin, accumulation of iron and calcium, and gliosis. QSM showed quantitative changes attributed to secondary damage in areas located rostral to the lesion site that appeared normal in R-2* maps. However, combination of QSM and R-2* was informative in disentangling the underlying tissue changes such as iron accumulation, demyelination, or calcifications. Therefore, combining QSM with R-2* measurement can provide a more detailed assessment of tissue changes and may pave the way for improved diagnosis of TBI, and several other complex neurodegenerative diseases.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differentiation of glioblastomas and solitary brain metastases is an important clinical problem because the treatment strategy can differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential added value of DTI metrics in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients with glioblastomas and 93 with brain metastases were retrospectively identified. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values were measured from the enhancing and peritumoral regions of the tumor. Two experienced neuroradiologists independently rated all cases by using conventional MR imaging and DTI. The diagnostic performances of the 2 raters and a DTI-based model were assessed individually and combined.; RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy values from the enhancing region of glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases (P < .01). There was no difference in mean diffusivity between the 2 tumor types. A classification model based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions differentiated glioblastomas from brain metastases with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, close to those obtained by 2 neuroradiologists using routine clinical images and DTI parameter maps (area under the curve = 0.90 and 0.85). The areas under the curve of the 2 radiologists were further improved to 0.96 and 0.93 by the addition of the DTI classification model.; CONCLUSIONS: Classification models based on fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the enhancing regions of the tumor can improve diagnostic performance in differentiating glioblastomas from brain metastases.

N2  -  Shutter-speed analysis of dynamic-contrast-agent (CA)-enhanced normal, multiple sclerosis (MS), and glioblastoma (GBM) human brain data gives the mean capillary water molecule lifetime ((b)) and blood volume fraction (v(b); capillary density-volume product (V-dagger)) in a high-resolution (H2O)-H-1 MRI voxel (40 L) or ROI. The equilibrium water extravasation rate constant, k(po) ((-1)(b)), averages 3.2 and 2.9 s(-1) in resting-state normal white matter (NWM) and gray matter (NGM), respectively (n = 6). The results (italicized) lead to three major conclusions. (A) k(po) differences are dominated by capillary water permeability (P-W(dagger)), not size, differences. NWM and NGM voxel k(po)and v(b) values are independent. Quantitative analyses of concomitant population-averaged k(po), v(b) variations in normal and normal-appearing MS brain ROIs confirm P(W)(dagger)dominance. (B) P-W(dagger) is dominated (>95%) by a trans(endothelial)cellular pathway, not the P-CA(dagger) paracellular route. In MS lesions and GBM tumors, P(CA)(dagger)increases but P(W)(dagger)decreases. (C) k(po) tracks steady-state ATP production/consumption flux per capillary. In normal, MS, and GBM brain, regional k(po)correlates with literature MRSI ATP (positively) and Na+ (negatively) tissue concentrations. This suggests that the P(W)(dagger)pathway is metabolically active. Excellent agreement of the relative NGM/NWM k(po)v(b) product ratio with the literature (PMRSI)-P-31-MT CMRoxphos ratio confirms the flux property. We have previously shown that the cellular water molecule efflux rate constant (k(io)) is proportional to plasma membrane P-type ATPase turnover, likely due to active trans-membrane water cycling. With synaptic proximities and synergistic metabolic cooperativities, polar brain endothelial, neuroglial, and neuronal cells form gliovascular units. We hypothesize that a chain of water cycling processes transmits brain metabolic activity to k(po), letting it report neurogliovascular unit Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Cerebral k(po) maps represent metabolic (functional) neuroimages. The NGM 2.9 s(-1)k(po) means an equilibrium unidirectional water efflux of similar to 10(15) H2O molecules s(-1) per capillary (in 1 L tissue): consistent with the known ATP consumption rate and water co-transporting membrane symporter stoichiometries.

N2  -  Purpose: Diffusional kurtosis metrics show high performance for detecting pathological changes and are therefore expected to be disease biomarkers. Kurtosis maps, however, tend to be noisy. The maps' visual quality is crucial for disease diagnosis, even when kurtosis is being used quantitatively. A Bayesian method was proposed to curtail the large statistical error inherent in kurtosis estimation while maintaining potential application to biomarkers.
Theory: Gaussian priors are determined from first-step estimations implemented using the least-square method (LSM). The likelihood-function variance is determined from the residuals of the estimation. Although the proposed approach is similar to a regularized LSM, regularization parameters do not have to be artificially adjusted. An appropriate balance between denoising and preventing false shrinkages of metric dispersions is automatically achieved.; Methods: Map qualities achieved using the conventional and proposed methods were compared. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for glioma-grade differentiation using simulated low-and high-grade glioma DWI datasets. Noninferiority of the proposed method was tested for areas under the curves (AUCs).; Results: The noisier the conventional maps, the better the proposed Bayesian method improved them. Noninferiority of the proposed method was confirmed by AUC tests for all kurtosis-related metrics. Superiority of the proposed method was also established for several metrics.; Conclusions: The proposed approach improved noisy kurtosis maps while maintaining their performances as biomarkers without increasing data acquisition requirements or arbitrarily choosing LSM regularization parameters. This approach may enable the use of higher-order terms in diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) fitting functions by suppressing overfitting, thereby improving the DKI-estimation accuracy.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) supplied by the anterior choroidal artery (AChA), or aBAVMs, remains challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the surgical outcomes and risk factors for worsened muscle strength (MS) after surgery in patients with aBAVMs.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 266 consecutive patients with BAVMs who underwent microsurgical resection of their BAVMs between September 2012 and June 2016. Patients were included if the BAVMs were entirely or partially supplied by the AChA. All patients had undergone preoperative diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography followed by resection. Both functional and angioarchitectural factors were analyzed with respect to the change in MS.; RESULTS: We identified 29 patients with aBAVMs who underwent surgical resection of the nidus. Radical resection was achieved in all patients. Thirteen (44.8%) patients suffered from postoperative short-term and 11 (37.9%) suffered from long-term MS deterioration. A shorter lesion-tocorticospinal tract distance (LCD) (P = 0.004) was significantly associated with postoperative short-term worsened MS. Shorter LCD (P = 0.018) and nidus supplied by cisternal segment of AChA (P = 0.026) were independent risk factors for the long-term MS worsening. The amplitudes and potential changes of intraoperative motor-evoked potential monitoring were consistent with the surgical outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of aBAVMs can cause a high incidence of MS deficits. Niduses supplied by cisternal segment of AChA and shorter LCD were crucial risk factors for postoperative MS worsening. Motor-evoked potential monitoring was an effective intraoperative technique to predict postoperative MS deficits.

N2  -  It is generally thought that the corticobulbar tract descends through the genu of the internal capsule (IC). There have been several reports that genu lesions cause bulbar symptoms such as facial palsies, dysarthria, and dysphagia. However, the precise location of the corticobulbar tract in the IC remains controversial. The purpose of our study is to assess whether the corticobulbar tract passes through the IC genii. We reviewed 26 patients with selective IC infarction and located the sites related to bulbar symptoms. In addition, using diffusion tensor imaging, we reconstructed tracts passing through the IC in ten subjects without cerebral infarction. Patients with genu infarction, which extended to more than half of the posterior limb of the IC, showed bulbar symptoms. However, patients with genu infarction, which was limited to the genu, did not have bulbar symptoms. In contrast, patients with lesions limited to the posterior limb may show bulbar symptoms. According to statistical maps of the region of interest, the lesions related to bulbar symptoms were localized to areas that were beyond the midpoint of the posterior limb of the IC. In diffusion tensor imaging of subjects without cerebral infarctions, the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts did not pass through the IC genu. Our data provide evidence that the corticobulbar tract does not pass through the IC genu. The proposed location of the cordcobulbar tract in the level of the IC lies beyond the midpoint of the posterior limb. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Key messageThe Riddoch syndrome is thought to be caused by damage to the primary visual cortex (V1), usually following a vascular event. This study shows that damage to the anatomical input to V1, i.e., the optic radiations, can result in selective visual deficits that mimic the Riddoch syndrome. The results also highlight the differential susceptibility of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual systems to injury. Overall, this study offers new insights that will improve our understanding of the impact of brain injury and neurosurgery on the visual pathways.AbstractThe Riddoch syndrome, characterised by the ability to perceive, consciously, moving visual stimuli but not static ones, has been associated with lesions of primary visual cortex (V1). We present here the case of patient YL who, after a tumour resection surgery that spared his V1, nevertheless showed symptoms of the Riddoch syndrome. Based on our testing, we postulated that the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) inputs to his V1 may be differentially affected. In a first experiment, YL was presented with static and moving checkerboards in his blind field while undergoing multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural, functional, and diffusion, acquired at 3 T. In a second experiment, we assessed YL's neural responses to M and P visual stimuli using psychophysics and high-resolution fMRI acquired at 7 T. YL's optic radiations were partially damaged but not severed. We found extensive activity in his visual cortex for moving, but not static, visual stimuli, while our psychophysical tests revealed that only low-spatial frequency moving checkerboards were perceived. High-resolution fMRI revealed strong responses in YL's V1 to M stimuli and very weak ones to P stimuli, indicating a functional P lesion affecting V1. In addition, YL frequently reported seeing moving stimuli and discriminating their direction of motion in the absence of visual stimulation, suggesting that he was experiencing visual hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights the possibility of a selective loss of P inputs to V1 resulting in the Riddoch syndrome and in hallucinations of visual motion.

N2  -  Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent innate brain tumor and still yields an unfavorable prognosis of 15 months of survival after diagnosis. Animal models play an important role in the investigation of therapeutic strategies of brain tumors. Thereby, MRI is substantial to individual follow-up examination for therapeutic response. Contrast agent dosage at 1.5 and 3 T MRI has been thoroughly tested, while there is hardly any data for 9.4 T Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the optimal contrast agent dosage at 9.4 T for examination of T1 relaxation time and apparent tumor volume in an animal model.
Material and methods: Six animals with a U-87 glioblastoma were part of this study. Scans were performed on a 9.4 T MRI. The MRI protocol contained a standard T1w sequence, which was employed for tumor volumetry and signal intensity measurement after single, double and triple contrast agent dosage injections and a T2w sequence for volumetry of tumor and edema. From a T1 map, T1 relaxation times and tumor area were measured. Histologic tumor size measurements were also performed for two animals.; Results: The mean apparent tumor volume in T1 w MRI increased significantly with each additional contrast agent injection, mainly due to the increase of the hyperintense tumor rim. Volumetry based on T2w MRI resulted in a higher tumor volume than in T1w volumetry, whereas the tumor volume in T1w MRI approached the volume in T2w MRI with increasing contrast agent dosage. Histology revealed an apparent tumor volume that corresponded to the volume of the hypointense center in T1 w MRI. In contrast, T1 time decrease and T1w signal increase occurred mainly in the tumor rim.; Conclusion: Increasing the contrast agent dosage led to an increase in apparent tumor volume. High-dose T1 MRI, however; overestimated the tumor volume that was determined by histology. Thereby, it can be concluded that standard contrast agent dosage is sufficient to visualize the core tumor volume in T1w MRI. Measurement of tumor volume after increasing contrast agent dosage depicts tumor core and edema, which can be due to diffusion or accumulation or both. Tumor core and edema, however, can be visualized by T2w MRI without need of additional contrast agent.

N2  -  Background: Post-stroke behavioral disinhibition (PSBD) is common in stroke survivors and often presents as impulsive, tactless or vulgar behavior. However, it often remains undiagnosed and thus untreated, even though it can lead to a longer length of stay in a rehabilitation facility. The proposed study will aim to evaluate the clinical, neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates of PSBD in a cohort of stroke survivors and describe its 12-month course. Methods: This prospective cohort study will recruit 237 patients and will be conducted at the Neurology Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital. The project duration will be 24 months. The patients will be examined by multiple MRI methods, including diffusion-weighted imaging, within 1 week after stroke onset. The patients and their caregivers will receive a detailed assessment at a research clinic at 3, 9 and 15 months after stroke onset (T1, T2 and T3, respectively). The disinhibition subscale of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) will be completed by each subject and caregiver, and scores >= 65 will be considered to indicate PSBD. A stepwise logistic regression will be performed to assess the importance of lesions in the regions of interest (ROIs), together with other significant variables identified in the univariate analyses. For patients with PSBD at T-1, the FrSBe disinhibition scores will be compared between the groups of patients with and without ROI infarcts, using covariance analysis. The demographic, clinical and MRI variables of remitters and non-remitters will be examined again at T-2 and T-3 by logistic regression. Discussion: This project will be the first MRI study on PSBD in stroke survivors. The results will shed light on the associations of lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe and subcortical brain structures with the risk of PSBD. The obtained data will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of PSBD in stroke, as well as other neurological conditions. The findings are thus likely to be applicable to the large population of patients with neurological disorders at risk of PSBD and are expected to stimulate further research in this field.

N2  -  Gait dysfunction is a leading cause of long-term disability after stroke. The mechanisms underlying recovery of gait function are unknown. We retrospectively evaluated the association between structural connectivity and gait function in 127 patients with unilateral supratentorial stroke (>1 month after stroke). All patients underwent T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and functional ambulation categorization. Voxel-wise linear regression analyses of the images were conducted using fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and mode of anisotropy mapping as dependent variables, while the functional ambulation category was used as an independent variable with age and days after stroke as covariates. The functional ambulation category was positively associated with increased fractional anisotropy in the lesioned cortico-ponto-cerebellar system, corona radiata of the non-lesioned corticospinal tract pathway, bilateral medial lemniscus in the brainstem, and the corpus callosum. The functional ambulation category was also positively associated with increased mode of anisotropy in the lesioned posterior corpus callosum. In conclusion, structural connectivity associated with motor coordination and feedback affects gait function after stroke. Diffusion tensor imaging for evaluating structural connectivity can help to predict gait recovery and target rehabilitation goals after stroke.

N2  -  Time-related changes in the distribution of chemical messengers in the rat spinal cord following the transection of dorsal and ventral roots were observed by using immunohistochemistry for the following antigens: microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), galanin (Gal), Met-enkephalin (Enk), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and serotonin (5-HT). To investigate dendrocytoarchitectonic organizational changes, morphometric analyses were performed on both the gray and the white matter of tissue samples stained with MAP2 antiserum. A significant reduction in the area of gray matter on the lesioned side was seen from 1 to 24 weeks postoperation, and progressive changes in the shape of the gray matter were also observed. CGRP-immunoreactive fibers were reduced in number in the posterior horn after root transection, except in the lateral part of lamina I. In contrast, CGRP immunoreactivity in the anterior horn cells of the ipsilateral side was increased early after transection, but later it progressively decreased. Root transection also caused significant reduction in the number of SP-immunoreactive fibers in the posterior horn, but no changes were seen in the anterior horn. Gal immunoreactivity was also affected by root transection, and it changed in a similar way to CGRP immunoreactivity. 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers were increased in the posterior horn after transection, and later decreased. In the anterior horn, there were no changes in the intensity or distribution pattern of 5-HT-immunoreactive nerve fibers following root transection. Enk and NPY immunoreactivity in the anterior and posterior horns was not affected by root transection up to 24 weeks postoperative. These results show that spinal root transection caused significant changes in the chemoarchitectural organization of nerve fibers containing certain types of chemical messengers, such as CGRP, SP, Gal, and 5-HT, in addition to altering dendritic geometry in the spinal cord.

N2  -  Background
An accurate prediction of tissue outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients is of high interest for treatment decision making. To date, various machine learning models have been proposed that combine multi-parametric imaging data for this purpose. However, most of these machine learning models were trained using voxel information extracted from the whole brain, without taking differences in susceptibility to ischemia into account that exist between brain regions. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a local tissue outcome prediction approach, which makes predictions using locally trained machine learning models and thus accounts for regional differences.; Material and methods; Multi-parametric MRI data from 99 acute ischemic stroke patients were used for the development and evaluation of the local tissue outcome prediction approach. Diffusion (ADC) and perfusion parameter maps (CBF, CBV, MTT, Tmax) and corresponding follow-up lesion masks for each patient were registered to the MNI brain atlas. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were trained employing a local approach, which makes predictions using models individually trained for each specific voxel position using the corresponding local data. A global approach, which uses a single model trained using all voxels of the brain, was used for comparison. Tissue outcome predictions resulting from the global and local RF and LR models, as well as a combined (hybrid) approach were quantitatively evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the Dice coefficient, and the sensitivity and specificity metrics.; Results; Statistical analysis revealed the highest ROC AUC and Dice values for the hybrid approach. With 0.872 (ROC AUC; LR) and 0.353 (Dice; RF), these values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the values of the two other approaches. In addition, the local approach achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.448 (LR). Overall, the hybrid approach was only outperformed in sensitivity (LR) by the local approach and in specificity by both other approaches. However, in these cases the effect sizes were comparatively small.; Conclusion; The results of this study suggest that using locally trained machine learning models can lead to better lesion outcome prediction results compared to a single global machine learning model trained using all voxel information independent of the location in the brain.

N2  -  One of the major challenges during glioblastoma surgery is balancing between maximizing extent of resection and preventing neurological deficits. Several surgical techniques and adjuncts have been developed to help identify eloquent areas both preoperatively (fMRI, nTMS, MEG, DTI) and intraoperatively (imaging (ultrasound, iMRI), electrostimulation (mapping), cerebral perfusion measurements (fUS)), and visualization (5-ALA, fluoresceine)). In this review, we give an update of the state-of-the-art management of both primary and recurrent glioblastomas. We will review the latest surgical advances, challenges, and approaches that define the onco-neurosurgical practice in a contemporary setting and give an overview of the current prospective scientific efforts.

T2  -  NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION

N2  -  Paediatric cancer survivors often suffer from cognitive long-term difficulties. Consequently, strengthening cognition is of major clinical relevance. This study investigated cerebral changes in relation to cognition in non-brain tumour paediatric cancer survivors after working memory or physical training compared to a control group. Thirty-four children (>= one-year post-treatment) either underwent eight weeks of working memory training (n = 10), physical training (n = 11), or a waiting period (n = 13). Cognition and MRI, including arterial spin labelling and diffusion tensor imaging, were assessed at three time points (baseline, post-training, and three-month follow-up). Results show lower cerebral blood flow immediately after working memory training (z = -2.073, p = .038) and higher structural connectivity at the three-month follow-up (z = -2.240, p = .025). No cerebral changes occurred after physical training. Short-term changes in cerebral blood flow correlated with short-term changes in cognitive flexibility (r = -.667, p = .049), while long-term changes in structural connectivity correlated with long-term changes in working memory (r = .786, p = .021). Despite the caution given when interpreting data from small samples, this study suggests a link between working memory training and neurophysiological changes. Further research is needed to validate these findings.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS

N2  -  Object. Nowadays the role of microsurgical management of intrinsic brain tumors is to maximize the volumetric resection of the tumoral tissue, minimizing the postoperative morbidity. The purpose of this paper was to study the benefits of an original protocol developed for the microsurgical treatment of tumors located in eloquent motor areas where the navigation and electrical stimulation of motor subcortical pathways have been implemented.
Methods. A total of 17 patients who underwent resection of cortical or subcortical tumors in motor areas have been included in the series. The preoperative planning for multimodal navigation was done by integrating anatomical studies, motor functional MR (fMR) imaging, and subcortical pathway volumes generated by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging. Intraoperative neuromonitoring included motor mapping by direct cortical stimulation (CS) and subcortical stimulation (sCS), and localization of the central sulcus by using cortical multipolar electrodes and the N20 wave inversion technique. The location of all cortically and subcortically stimulated points with positive motor response was stored in the navigator and correlated with the cortical and subcortical motor functional structures defined preoperatively.; Results. The mean tumoral volumetric resection was 89.1 +- 14.2% of the preoperative volume, with a total resection (>= 100%) in 8 patients. Preoperatively a total of 58.8% of the patients had some kind of motor neurological deficit, increasing 24 hours after surgery to 70.6% and decreasing to 47.1% at 1 month later. There was a great correlation between anatomical and functional data, both cortically and subcortically. A total of 52 cortical points submitted to CS had positive motor response, with a positive correlation of 83.7%. Also, a total of 55 subcortical points had positive motor response; in these cases the mean distance from the stimulated point to the subcortical tract was 7.3 +- 3.1 mm.; Conclusions. The integration of anatomical and functional studies allows a safe functional resection of the brain tumors located in eloquent areas. Multimodal navigation allows integration and correlation among preoperative and intraoperative anatomical and functional data. Cortical motor functional areas are anatomically and functionally located preoperatively thanks to MR and fMR imaging and subcortical motor pathways with DT imaging and tractography. Intraoperative confirmation is done with CS and N20 inversion wave for cortical structures and with sCS for subcortical pathways. With this protocol the authors achieved a good volumetric resection in cortical and subcortical tumors located in eloquent motor areas, with an increase in the incidence of neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period that significantly decreased 1 month later. Ongoing studies must define the safe limits for functional resection, taking into account the intraoperative brain shift. Finally, it must be demonstrated whether this protocol has any long-term benefit for patients by prolonging the disease-free interval, the time to recurrence, or the survival time.

T2  -  DIAGNOSTICS

N2  -  Diffusion MRI is a useful tool to investigate the microstructure of brain tumors. However, the presence of fast diffusing isotropic signals originating from non-restricted edematous fluids, within and surrounding tumors, may obscure estimation of the underlying tissue characteristics, complicating the radiological interpretation and quantitative evaluation of diffusion MRI. A multi-shell regularized free water (FW) elimination model was therefore applied to separate free water from tissue-related diffusion components from the diffusion MRI of 26 treatment-naive glioma patients. We then investigated the diagnostic value of the derived measures of FW maps as well as FW-corrected tensor-derived maps of fractional anisotropy (FA). Presumed necrotic tumor regions display greater mean and variance of FW content than other parts of the tumor. On average, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for the classification of necrotic and enhancing tumor volumes increased by 5% in corrected data compared to non-corrected data. FW elimination shifts the FA distribution in non-enhancing tumor parts toward higher values and significantly increases its entropy (p <= 0.003), whereas skewness is decreased (p <= 0.004). Kurtosis is significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in high-grade tumors. In conclusion, eliminating FW contributions improved quantitative estimations of FA, which helps to disentangle the cancer heterogeneity.

N2  -  Background The interpretation system for prostate MRI is largely based on qualitative image contrast of different tissue types. Therefore, a fast, standardized, and robust quantitative technique is necessary. Synthetic MRI is capable of quantifying multiple relaxation parameters, which might have potential applications in prostate cancer (PCa).
Purpose To investigate the use of quantitative relaxation maps derived from synthetic MRI for the diagnosis and grading of PCa.; Study Type Prospective.; Subjects In all, 94 men with pathologically confirmed PCa or benign pathological changes.; Field StrengthSequence T-1-weighted imaging, T-2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and synthetic MRI at 3.0T.; Assessment Four kinds of tissue types were identified on pathology, including PCa, stromal hyperplasia (SH), glandular hyperplasia (GH), and noncancerous peripheral zone (PZ). PCa foci were grouped as low-grade (LG, Gleason score <= 6) and intermediatehigh-grade (HG, Gleason score >= 7). Regions of interest were manually drawn by two radiologists in consensus on parametric maps according to the pathological results.; Statistical Tests Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.; Results T-1 and T-2 values of PCa were significantly lower than SH (P = 0.015 and 0.002). The differences of T-1 and T-2 values between PCa and noncancerous PZ were also significant (P <= 0.006). The area under the curve (AUC) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was significantly higher than T-1, T-2, and proton density (PD) values in discriminating PCa from SH and noncancerous PZ (P <= 0.025). T-2, PD, and ADC values demonstrated similar diagnostic performance in discriminating LG from HG PCa (AUC = 0.806 0.640-0.918, 0.717 0.542-0.854, and 0.817 0.652-0.925, respectively; P >= 0.535).; Data Conclusion Relaxation maps derived from synthetic MRI were helpful for discriminating PCa from other benign pathologies. But the overall diagnostic performance was inferior to the ADC values. T-2, PD, and ADC values performed similarly in discriminating LG from HG PCa lesions.; Technical Efficacy Stage: 2

N2  -  We assessed the effects of low dose methamphetamine treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats by employing MRI, immunohistology, and neurological functional tests. Young male Wistar rats were subjected to TBI using the controlled cortical impact model. The treated rats (n = 10) received an intravenous (iv) bolus dose of 0.42 mg/kg of methamphetamine at eight hours after the TBI followed by continuous iv infusion for 24 hrs. The control rats (n = 10) received the same volume of saline using the same protocol. MRI scans, including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were performed one day prior to TBI, and at 1 and 3 days post TBI, and then weekly for 6 weeks. The lesion volumes of TBI damaged cerebral tissue were demarcated by elevated values in T-2 maps and were histologically identified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values within regions-of-interest (ROI) were measured in FA maps deduced from DTI, and were directly compared with Bielschowsky's silver and Luxol fast blue (BLFB) immunohistological staining. No therapeutic effect on lesion volumes was detected during 6 weeks after TBI. However, treatment significantly increased FA values in the recovery ROI compared with the control group at 5 and 6 weeks after TBI. Myelinated axons histologically measured using BLFB were significantly increased (p<0.001) in the treated group (25.84 +/- 1.41%) compared with the control group (17.05 +/- 2.95%). Significant correlations were detected between FA and BLFB measures in the recovery ROI (R = 0.54, p<0.02). Methamphetamine treatment significantly reduced modified neurological severity scores from 2 to 6 weeks (p<0.05) and foot-fault errors from 3 days to 6 weeks (p<0.05) after TBI. Thus, the FA data suggest that methamphetamine treatment improves white matter reorganization from 5 to 6 weeks after TBI in rats compared with saline treatment, which may contribute to the observed functional recovery.

N2  -  ObjectiveWe tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.
MethodsTwenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.; ResultsChildren with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.; InterpretationBoth sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017;82:766-780

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Intraoperative overestimation of resection volume in epilepsy surgery is a well-known problem that can lead to an unfavorable seizure outcome. Intraoperative MRI (iMRI) combined with neuronavigation may help surgeons avoid this pitfall and facilitate visualization and targeting of sometimes ill-defined heterogeneous lesions or epileptogenic zones and may increase the number of complete resections and improve seizure outcome.
METHODS To investigate this hypothesis, the authors conducted a retrospective clinical study of consecutive surgical procedures performed during a 10-year period for epilepsy in which they used neuronavigation combined with iMRI and functional imaging (functional MRI for speech and motor areas; diffusion tensor imaging for pyramidal, speech, and visual tracts; and magnetoencephalography and electrocorticography for spike detection). Altogether, there were 415 patients (192 female and 223 male, mean age 37.2 years; 41% left-sided lesions and 84.9% temporal epileptogenic zones). The mean preoperative duration of epilepsy was 17.5 years. The most common epilepsy-associated pathologies included hippocampal sclerosis (n = 146 35.2%), long-term epilepsy-associated tumor (LEAT) (n = 67 16.1%), cavernoma (n = 45 10.8%), focal cortical dysplasia (n = 31 7.5%), and epilepsy caused by scar tissue (n = 23 5.5%).; RESULTS In 11.8% (n = 49) of the surgeries, an intraoperative second-look surgery (SLS) after incomplete resection verified by iMRI had to be performed. Of those incomplete resections, LEATs were involved most often (40.8% of intraoperative SLSs, 29.9% of patients with LEAT). In addition, 37.5% (6 of 16) of patients in the diffuse glioma group and 12.9% of the patients with focal cortical dysplasia underwent an SLS. Moreover, iMRI provided additional advantages during implantation of grid, strip, and depth electrodes and enabled intraoperative correction of electrode position in 13.0% (3 of 23) of the cases. Altogether, an excellent seizure outcome (Engel Class I) was found in 72.7% of the patients during a mean follow-up of 36 months (range 3 months to 10.8 years). The greatest likelihood of an Engel Class I outcome was found in patients with cavernoma (83.7%), hippocampal sclerosis (78.8%), and LEAT (75.8%). Operative revisions that resulted from infection occurred in 0.3% of the patients, from hematomas in 1.6%, and from hydrocephalus in 0.8%. Severe visual field defects were found in 5.2% of the patients, aphasia in 5.7%, and hemiparesis in 2.7%, and the total mortality rate was 0%.; CONCLUSIONS Neuronavigation combined with iMRI was beneficial during surgical procedures for epilepsy and led to favorable seizure outcome with few specific complications. A significantly higher resection volume associated with a higher chance of favorable seizure outcome was found, especially in lesional epilepsy involving LEAT or diffuse glioma.

N2  -  Introduction: Meningiomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors. Predicting the grade and proliferative activity of meningiomas would influence therapeutic strategies. We aimed to apply the multiple parameters from preoperative diffusion tensor images for predicting meningioma grade and proliferative activity. Methods: Nineteen patients with low-grade meningiomas and eight with high-grade meningiomas were included. For the prediction of proliferative activity, the patients were divided into two groups: Ki-67 monoclonal antibody labeling index (MIB-1 LI) < 5% (lower MIB-1 LI group; n = 18) and MIB-1 LI >= 5% (higher MIB-1 LI group; n = 9). Six features, diffusion-weighted imaging, fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities, and raw T2 signal with no diffusion weighting, were extracted as multiple parameters from diffusion tensor imaging. The two-level clustering approach for a self-organizing map followed by the K-means algorithm was applied to cluster a large number of input vectors with the six features. We also validated whether the diffusion tensor-based clustered image (DTcI) was helpful for predicting preoperative meningioma grade or proliferative activity. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves from the 16-class DTcIs for differentiating high- and low-grade meningiomas were 0.870, 0.901, 0.891, and 0.959, and those from the 10-class DTcIs for differentiating higher and lower MIB-1 LIs were 0.508, 0.770, 0.683, and 0.694, respectively. The log-ratio values of class numbers 13, 14, 15, and 16 were significantly higher in high-grade meningiomas than in low-grade meningiomas (p < .001). With regard to MIB-1 LIs, the log-ratio values of class numbers 8, 9, and 10 were higher in meningiomas with higher MIB-1 groups (p < .05). Conclusion: The multiple diffusion tensor imaging-based parameters from the voxel-based DTcIs can help differentiate between low- and high-grade meningiomas and between lower and higher proliferative activities.

N2  -  Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) perfusion measurements in the brain with currently available imaging systems. Materials and Methods We acquired high in-plane resolution (1.2 x 1.2 mm(2)) diffusion-weighted images with 16 different values of b ranging from 0 to 900 s/mm(2), in three orthogonal directions, on 3T systems with a 32-multichannel receiver head coil. IVIM perfusion maps were extracted by fitting a double exponential model of signal amplitude decay. Regions of interest were drawn in pathological and control regions, where IVIM perfusion parameters were compared to the corresponding dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) parameters. Results Hyperperfusion was found in the nonnecrotic or cystic part of two histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme and in two histologically proven glioma WHO grade III, as well as in a brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, in a large meningioma, and in a case of ictal hyperperfusion. A monoexponential decay was found in a territory of acute ischemia, as well as in the necrotic part of a glioblastoma. The IVIM perfusion fraction f correlated well with DSC CBV. Conclusion Our initial report suggests that high-resolution brain perfusion imaging is feasible with IVIM in the current clinical setting. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:624-632.

N2  -  Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of 1.5-T and 3.0-T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to detect hyperacute ischemic stroke lesions.
Methods: We blindly reviewed the DWI of 135 acute stroke patients and 34 controls performed at 1.5 T (n = 108) or 3.0 T (n = 61). The stroke patients all had subsequently proved carotid territory ischemic stroke and were imaged within the first 6 hours after stroke onset. Four readers (2 neuroradiologists and 2 stroke neurologists) blinded to clinical data and magnetic field strength recorded the presence of ischemic lesions on DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps if necessary. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rates were computed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and DWI contrasts were calculated at both field strengths.; Results: The accuracy of DVVI in stroke diagnosis was superior at 1.5 T (98.8%) than at 3.0 T (90.9%, p = 0.03). The sensitivity decreased from 99.1% at 1.5 T to 92.5% at 3.0 T (p = 0.06) and the specificity from 97.8% to 84.1% (p = 0.002). ADC map readings did not improve accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity. The false-negative rate was 0.6% at 1.5 T and 6.1% at 3.0 T. Type of readers, stroke severity, and type of the coil did not affect diagnosis value. SNR and CNR were significantly higher at 3 T (p < 0.0001) but DWI contrast was lower (p = 0.04).; Conclusions: Blind reading by 4 experts of a large series of images shows that 1.5-T diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is better than 3.0-T DWI for the imaging of hyperacute stroke during the therapeutic window of thrombolysis.

N2  -  Transforming growth factor-beta1 rapidly increases in adult rat brain in response to experimental lesions. This study characterized the schedule of changes, regional distribution, and cellular localization of striatal transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA and fibronectin messenger RNA following partial striatal deafferentation by frontal cortex ablation. Frontal cortex ablation induced striatal transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA elevations that coincided temporally and overlapped anatomically with the course of degeneration of cortico-striatal afferent fibers. Within three days post-lesioning, transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA was localized at the cortical wound. By 10 days, the anatomical site of transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA expression shifted to the dorsal half of the deafferented striatum and co-localized with OX-42+ immunostained microglia-macrophage at the site of degenerating afferent terminals, Similarly, fibronectin messenger RNA also shifted from the cortical wound to the deafferented striatum by 10 days post-lesioning. Fibronectin messenger RNA was localized to glial fibrillary acidic protein+ immunostained astrocytes surrounding degenerating corticostriatal afferents. Infusion of transforming growth factor-beta1 peptide elevated striatal and cortical fibronectin messenger RNA. These findings suggest that microglia-macrophage associated with degenerating afferent fibres can upregulate transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA and may influence fibronectin messenger RNA synthesis in reactive astrocytes.
This study suggests that transforming growth factor-beta1 has a role in controlling extracellular matrix synthesis following brain injury, which is analogous to that in peripheral wound healing.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Malignant and atypical meningiomas are prone to recurrence and aggressive growth, which affects treatment planning and prognostication. Investigators have used diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to compare tumor grade and cellularity with the histopathologic findings of intraaxial primary brain neoplasms. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the signal characteristics of meningiomas on diffusion-weighted images correlate with the average diffusion constant (D-av) from ADC maps and histopathologic findings and whether the D-av can reliably distinguish benign from malignant and atypical meningiomas.
METHODS: Seventeen patients (13 women and four men; average age, 55 years) with meningiomas were prospectively studied using routine MR imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging with a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence (6000100 TRTE) and b values of 0 and 1000. Signal characteristics on routine MR and diffusion-weighted images were compared with the histopathologic findings after resection by using World Health Organization criteria. D-av values were calculated within the tumor mass from ADC maps before resection,; RESULTS: Four meningiomas were malignant or atypical (World Health Organization grades II and III). D-av values were lower than normal brain values (average, 0.52 +- 0.12 x 10(-5)cm(2)s; range, 0.45-0.69 x 10(5)cm(2)s) and were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and hypointense on ADC maps. Thirteen meningiomas were benign. D-av values were higher than normal brain values (average, 1.03 +- 0.29 x 10(-5)cm(2)s; range, 0.62-1.8 x 10(-5)cm(2)s). On diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps, most were isointense. Five benign meningiomas had very high D-av values, bright signal on ADC maps, and distinct histopathologic findings, including microcysts, necrotic infarct, and organizing intratumoral hemorrhage. The difference in D-av values between malignant and benign meningiomas was statistically significant (P < .00029).; CONCLUSION: Albeit a small sample size, meningiomas with low D-av tended to be malignant or highly atypical (P < .00029) whereas meningiomas with the highest D-av had increased water content due to either a specific histologic subtype of meningioma or the presence of associated pathologic abnormality.

N2  -  Reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke have demonstrated their efficacy in promoting clinical recovery. However, ischemia/reperfusion injury and related inflammation remain a major challenge in patient clinical management. We evaluated the spatio-temporal evolution of inflammation using sequential clinical [C-11]PK11195 PET-MRI in a non-human primate (NHP) stroke model mimicking endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with a neuroprotective cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. The NHP underwent a 110-min transient endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion. We acquired [C-11]PK11195 dynamic PET-MR imaging at baseline, 7 and 30 days after intervention. Individual voxel-wise analysis was performed thanks to a baseline scan database. We quantified [C-11]PK11195 in anatomical regions and in lesioned areas defined on per-occlusion MR diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion [O-15(2)]H2OPET imaging. [C-11]PK11195 parametric maps showed a clear uptake overlapping the lesion core at D7, which further increased at D30. Voxel-wise analysis identified individuals with significant inflammation at D30, with voxels located within the most severe diffusion reduction area during occlusion, mainly in the putamen. The quantitative analysis revealed that thalamic inflammation lasted until D30 and was significantly reduced in the CsA-treated group compared to the placebo. In conclusion, we showed that chronic inflammation matched ADC decrease at occlusion time, a region exposed to an initial burst of damage-associated molecular patterns, in an NHP stroke model mimicking EVT. We described secondary thalamic inflammation and the protective effect of CsA in this region. We propose that major ADC drop in the putamen during occlusion may identify individuals who could benefit from early personalized treatment targeting inflammation.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: Diffusion MRI characteristics have been used as biomarkers to guide prognosis in cerebral pathologies including brain metastases. The measurement of ADC is often described poorly in. clinical and research studies with little detail given to the practical considerations of where to place ROIs, which post processing software package to use and how reproducible the resulting metrics will be.
Method: We investigated a series of 12 patients with brain metastases and preoperative DWI. Three post processing platforms were used. ROI were placed over the tumour, peritumoural region and across the brain-tumour interface. These recordings were made by a neurosurgeon and a neuroradiologist. Interintra-observer variability was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. An exploratory analysis of DWI with overall survival and tumour type was made.; Results: There was excellent correlation between the software packages used for all measures including assessing the whole tumour, selective regions with lowest ADC, the change of ADC across the brain-tumour interface and the relation of the tumour ADC to peritumoural regions and the normal white matter. There was no significant inter-.or intra-observer variability for repeated readings. There were significant differences in the mean values obtained using different methodologies and different metrics had differing relationships to overall survival and primary tumour of origin.; Conclusion: Diffusion weighted MRI metrics offer promise as potential non-invasive biomarkers in brain metastases and a variety of metrics have been shown to be reliably measured using differing platforms and observers.

N2  -  Introduction There is growing evidence that the subventricular zone (SVZ) plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM) tumorigenesis. However, little is known regarding how the SVZ, which is a harbor for adult neural stem cells, may be influenced by chemoradiation. The current diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) study explored ipsilateral and contralateral alterations in the anterior SVZ in GBM patients with posterior enhancing lesions following chemoradiation. Methods Forty GBM patients with tumor involvement in the posterior SVZ (mean age = 57 +/- 10; left-hemisphere N = 25; right-hemisphere N = 15) were evaluated using DWI before and after chemoradiation. Regions-of-interest were drawn on the ipsilesional and contralesional anterior SVZ on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for both timepoints. ADC histogram analysis was performed by modeling a bimodal, double Gaussian distribution to obtain ADC(L), defined as the mean of the lower Gaussian distribution. Results The ipsilesional SVZ had lower ADC(L) values compared to the contralesional SVZ before treatment (mean difference = 0.025 mu m(2)/ms; P = 0.007). Following chemoradiation, these changes were no longer observed (mean difference = 0.0025 mu m(2)/ms; P > 0.5), as ADC(L) values of the ipsilesional SVZ increased (mean difference = 0.026 mu m(2)/ms; P = 0.037). An increase in ipsilesional ADC(L) was associated with shorter progression-free (P = 0.0119) and overall survival (P = 0.0265). Conclusions These preliminary observations suggest baseline asymmetry as well as asymmetric changes in the SVZ proximal (ipsilesional) to the tumor with respect to contralesional SVZ regions may be present in GBM, potentially implicating this region in tumorigenesis and/or treatment resistance.

N2  -  Impaired gait function after stroke contributes strongly to overall patient disability. However, the response to rehabilitation varies between individuals. The aims of this study were to identify predictors of gait velocity change and to elucidate lesion location associated with change of balance and gait function.
We reviewed 102 stroke patients. The patients were divided into two groups according to gait ability post-rehabilitation, and we analyzed differences in their characteristics, such as demographic information, lesion factors, and initial balance function. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to examine the predictors of rehabilitation response. Lesion location and volume were measured on brain magnetic resonance images. We generated statistical maps of the lesions related to functional gains in gait and balance using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM).; The group of patients who regained independent ambulation function showed a smaller lesion size, a shorter duration from stroke onset, and higher initial balance function. In the regression model, gait velocity changes were predicted with the initial Berg balance scale (BBS) and duration post-onset. Absolute BBS changes were also correlated with the duration post-onset and initial BBS, and relative BBS changes were predicted by the baseline BBS. Using VLSM, lesion locations associated with gait velocity changes and balance adjusting for other factors were the insula, internal capsule, and adjacent white matter.; Initial balance function as well as the interval between stroke onset and the initiation of therapy might influence balance recovery and gait velocity changes. Damage to the insula and internal capsule also affected gait velocity change after rehabilitation.

N2  -  Background We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular pathway (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage electricity. Case presentation A 39-year-old man presented with quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed. Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. Conclusion Depiction of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical injury.

N2  -  Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to basilar artery occlusion (BAO) represents 1-4% of all ischemic strokes. BAO results in strokes associated with a high risk of a poor functional outcome and, in 86-95% of the untreated cases, it results in death because of the vital cerebral structures involved. Diagnosis can be delayed because of the variability in presenting symptoms, and acute treatment is often attempted even beyond 6 h from symptoms onset because of the high risk of a fatal prognosis. Objective: In this observational study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with AIS due to BAO referred to the stroke center of the University Hospital of Messina. We aimed to assess prognostic factors and to evaluate the association between clinical outcome and posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS) and collateral status. Method: BAO was confirmed by cerebral computed tomography (CT) angiography or cerebral angiography. All patients underwent CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We assessed the pc-ASPECTS on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MR images and the Posterior Circulation Collateral Score (PC-CS) for every patient. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: The study population consisted of 27 patients; 16 males and 11 females. The mean age was 66 (+/- 14) years. We observed a favorable outcome (mRS 0-3) in 40.7% of cases, 25.9% reached mRS 0-2, and 29.6% had a poor clinical outcome (mRS 4-5). Patient survival was 70.4%, whereas 8 patients died (29.6%). In 7 patients, pc-ASPECTS was >= 7. According to the PC-CS, 33.3% had moderate collaterals and 63.0% had good collateral status prior to receiving the treatment. Favorable outcome was significantly associated with age, NIHSS score at admission, pc-ASPECTS, hypercholesterolemia, and female sex but not with the other risk factors. Conclusions: In our study, we found that younger age, low NIHSS score at admission, and high pc-ASPECTS, but not onset to treatment time, are associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Transferred patients did not have a significantly poorer outcome. These findings confirm that acute stroke treatment improves clinical outcome in BAO patients, in spite of a delayed diagnosis and an extended therapeutic window, considering lesion volume and localization in DWI MRI.

N2  -  Background: A target mismatch profile can identify good clinical response to recanalization after acute ischemic stroke, but does not consider region specificities. Purpose: To test whether location-weighted infarction core and mismatch, determined from diffusion and perfusion MRI performed in patients with acute stroke, could improve prediction of good clinical response to mechanical thrombectomy compared with a target mismatch profile. Materials and Methods: In this secondary analysis, two prospectively collected independent stroke data sets (2012-2015 and 2017-2019) were analyzed. From the brain before stroke (BBS) study data (data set 1), an eloquent map was computed through voxel-wise associations between the infarction core (based on diffusion MRI on days 1-3 following stroke) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. The French acute multimodal imaging to select patients for mechanical thrombectomy (FRAME) data (data set 2) consisted of large vessel occlusion-related acute ischemic stroke successfully recanalized. From acute MRI studies (performed on arrival, prior to thrombectomy) in data set 2, target mismatch and eloquent (vs noneloquent) infarction core and mismatch were computed from the intersection of diffusion-and perfusion-detected lesions with the coregistered eloquent map. Associations of these imaging metrics with early neurologic improvement were tested in multivariable regression models, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were compared. Results: Data sets 1 and 2 included 321 (median age, 69 years [IQR, 58-80 years]; 207 men) and 173 (median age, 74 years [IQR, 65-82 years]; 90 women) patients, respectively. Eloquent mismatch was positively and independently associated with good clinical response (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.27; P = .02) and eloquent infarction core was negatively associated with good response (OR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.95; P = .004), while noneloquent mismatch was not associated with good response (OR, 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.07; P = .20). Moreover, adding eloquent metrics improved the prediction accuracy (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.81) compared with clinical variables alone (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.73; P = .01) or a target mismatch profile (AUC, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.76; P = .03). Conclusion: Location-weighted infarction core and mismatch on diffusion and perfusion MRI scans improved the identification of pa-tients with acute stroke who would benefit from mechanical thrombectomy compared with the volume-based target mismatch profile.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively determine the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for discrimination of malignant neck nodes due to lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), with histologic findings and imaging criteria as reference standards.
Materials and Methods: Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Patients with malignant lymphadenopathy underwent 1.5-T diffusion-weighted MR imaging. A region of interest was drawn around the malignant node on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps; ADC values were compared (Kruskal- Wallis test). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to investigate whether ADC values could aid in discrimination among malignancies.; Results: Forty-three patients (34 men, nine women; mean age, 54 years) with 43 nodes underwent imaging. Mean ADC values for lymphoma (n = 8), NPC (n = 17), and SCC (n = 18) were (0.664 +- 0.071 standard deviation) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, (0.802 +- 0.128) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, and (1.057 +- 0.169) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, respectively, with significant differences between SCC and lymphoma or NPC (P < .001) and between NPC and lymphoma (P = .04). To optimize sensitivity and specificity with equal weighting, ADC threshold values for distinguishing between SCC and NPC, between SCC and lymphoma, and between NPC and lymphoma were 0.894 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, 0.824 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, and 0.694 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec, respectively. To produce a 100% specificity while sensitivity is maximized, the following ADC threshold values were obtained for prediction of differentiation between malignancies: (a) SCC versus lymphoma, greater than 0.824 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (sensitivity, 94%), and lymphoma versus SCC, less than 0.767 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (sensitivity 88%); (b) NPC versus SCC, less than 0.764 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (sensitivity, 47%), and SCC versus NPC, greater than 1.093 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (sensitivity, 39%); (c) NPC versus lymphoma, greater than 0.788 x 10(-3) mm(2)sec (sensitivity, 53%), and lymphoma versus NPC, no suitable threshold value.; Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging shows significant differences among malignant nodes of SCC, lymphoma, and NPC. ADC threshold values can help distinguish SCC from lymphoma.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer need high-quality information about disease stage, treatment options, and side effects. High-quality information can also improve health literacy, shared decision making, and satisfaction. We created patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) models of tumors including surrounding functional areas and assessed what patients with glioma value (or fear) about the models when they are used to educate them about the relationship between their tumor and specific brain parts, the surgical procedure, and risks.
METHODS: This exploratory study included adult patients with glioma who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging as part of preoperative work-up. All participants received an actual-size 3D model printed based on functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify facilitators and barriers for using the model and perceived effects.; RESULTS: Models were successfully created for all 11 participants. There were 18 facilitators and 8 barriers identified. The model improved patients' understanding about their situation; patients reported that it was easier to ask their neurosurgeon questions based on their model and that it supported their decision about preferred treatment. A perceived barrier for using the 3D model was that it could be emotionally confronting, particularly in an early phase of the disease. Positive effects were related to psychological domains, including coping, learning effects, and communication.; CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific 3D models are promising and simple tools that could help patients with glioma better understand their situation, treatment options, and risks. These models have the potential to improve shared decision making.

N2  -  Cognitive dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the relationship between white matter (WM) damage and cognition remains insufficiently clear. This study investigates the extent and severity of WM diffusion abnormalities in MS patients and relations with cognition. Diffusion tensor imaging scans were obtained in 131 MS patients (88 women, 6 years postdiagnosis) and 49 age-matched controls (29 women). Patient groups were equal in terms of disease duration, disability, and WM lesion volume. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were compared between groups. Post hoc analyses calculated the spatial extent and severity of diffusion abnormalities to relate these to cognitive performance. In controls, 31% of WM voxels showed higher FA in men; therefore, all patient analyses were within-sex. The extent of diffusion changes was higher in male patients than in female patients for all parameters (FA: 24% in women, 53% in men), as was the severity of changes (FA: Z = -0.18 in women, Z = -0.41 in men). Especially the extent of FA abnormalities was strongly related to cognitive performance in all patients (r = -0.42, P < 0.0001). Regionally, thalamic decreases in FA were especially correlated with cognitive performance. Cognitively impaired patients showed greater extent and severity on all diffusion parameters compared to cognitively preserved patients. The WM of male patients was both more extensively and also more severely affected than that of female patients. The extent of WM FA changes, especially in the thalamus, was associated with cognitive performance in this cohort of early MS patients. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2348-2358, 2014.

N2  -  Sympathetic nerves innervate targets in the orbit and the brain. They issue from the superior cervical ganglion and reach the parasellar region via the internal carotid nerve. Information on their further parasellar course and distribution is scant and contradictory. In this study the parasellar sympathetic pathways of 30 human infants and 6 human fetuses were investigated by microdissection and histologically. A common parasellar sympathetic trunk, which reunites all the nerve fibers emanating from the lateral and medial internal carotid plexus, is described as well as its further divisions. It was found that the posterior knee of the infant carotid siphon is free of large sympathetic nerve bundles. In addition a ganglion is described, which is situated in the parasellar adipose body. It is reached by nerve fibers coming from the parasellar sympathetic pathways. Fibers that issue from this ganglion join the periorbita and the orbital muscle of Muller. These anatomical facts are of immediate importance for preventing nerve damage during cavernous sinus surgery. Furthermore, the study improves the anatomical knowledge of the parasellar region and suggests a new concept for the innervation of the orbital muscle.

N2  -  (1) Humans with spinal cord lesions often show detrusor-sphincteric dyssynergia of the urinary bladder which is reflected urodynamically in the detrusor pressure and a simultaneous increase in electromyographic pelvic floor activity. (2) The time-course of the increase in the secondary muscle spindle afferent activity, induced by the parasympathetic nervous system in muscle spindles contributing to continence, is very similar to that of detrusor pressure. The detrusor-sphincteric dyssynergia is therefore analysed by comparing the natural impulse patterns of secondary muscle spindle afferents (SP2) and sphincteric motoneurons in a brain-dead human with those in patients with spinal cord lesion. The parasympathetic nervous system was activated by painful bladder catheter pulling. (3) In a brain-dead human the sphinteric motoneurons subserving continence were inhibited at a time, when preganglionic parasympathetic efferents increased their activity for 10 s and an SP2 fibre increased its activity for several minutes. In a paraplegic with a strong bladder dysfunction, the SP2 fibre activity increased, due to parasympathetic activation, lasted for approx. 1 min, showed undulations and its amplitude was smaller than that measured in a brain-dead human. The sphincteric motoneurons were not inhibited. (4) In the brain-dead human, an SP2 fibre showed doublet firing with interspike intervals (IIs) of a duration between 10 and 14 ms for low level parasympathetic activation. For high level parasympathetic activation this single parent spindle afferent fibre showed multi-ending regular firing of up to 6 endings with IIs of a duration of predominantly 15 to 25 ms. In one paraplegic with a strong bladder dysfunction the doublet firing was less regular, even though two II peaks at 10.2 and 11.2 ms occurred in a II distribution similar to the brain-dead human. The multi-ending regular firing was replaced by a repeated burst firing. In a second paraplegic with strong detrusor-sphincteric dyssynergia the burst firing consisted of up to 6 impulses with increasing IIs and a first II of approx. 0.2 ms (transmission frequency 5000 Hz). In a third paraplegic with a lesser dysfunction of the bladder a highly activated SP2 fibre showed an activity pattern intermediate to those of multi-ending regular firing and burst firing. (5) The time constant for the activity decrease of a spindle afferent fibre following parasympathetic activation was to 31 s in a paraplegic and approx. 40 s in a brain-dead human. It is concluded that the muscle spindles are unchanged following spinal cord lesion. The pathologic firing patterns of the SP2 fibres are thus a result of neuronal network changes in the parasympathetic nervous system of the sacral micturition center. (6) Differences in axon membrane properties between animals and humans, simultaneous action of the somatic and the parasympathetic divisions, the detrusor-sphincteric coordination, hyperreflexia and clinical implications are discussed.

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Perfusion CT has been used to assess the extent of blood-brain barrier breakdown. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of blood-brain barrier permeability measured using perfusion CT for development of malignant middle cerebral artery infarction requiring hemicraniectomy (HC).
Methods-We retrospectively identified patients from our stroke registry who had middle cerebral artery infarction and were evaluated with admission perfusion CT. Blood-brain barrier permeability and cerebral blood volume maps were generated and infarct volumes calculated. Clinical and radiographic characteristics were compared between those who underwent HC versus those who did not undergo HC.; Results-One hundred twenty-two patients (12 HC, 110 no HC) were identified. Twelve patients who underwent HC had developed edema, midline shift, or infarct expansion. Infarct permeability area, infarct cerebral blood volume area, and infarct volumes were significantly different (P<0.018, P<0.0211, P<0.0001, P<0.0014) between HC and no HC groups. Age (P=0.03) and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (P=0.0029) were found to be independent predictors for HC. Using logistic regression modeling, there was an association between increased infarct permeability area and HC. The OR for HC based on a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-cm(2) increase in infarct permeability area were 1.179, 1.390, 1.638, or 1.932, respectively (95% CI, 1.035 to 1.343, 1.071 to 1.804, 1.108 to 2.423, 1.146 to 3.255, respectively).; Conclusion-Increased infarct permeability area is associated with an increased likelihood for undergoing HC. Because early HC for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction has been associated with better outcomes, the infarct permeability area on admission perfusion CT might be a useful tool to predict malignant middle cerebral artery infarction and need for HC.

N2  -  PURPOSE: We hypothesized that a difference in restricted diffusion would exist in patients with connective tissue disorders (CTD) as compared with those without CTD. Our purpose was to determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurement could be used to identify parotid abnormalities in patients with CTD.
METHODS: One neuroradiologist, who was unaware of patient histories, retrospectively measured the ADC values for the parotid glands in 121 patients who underwent clinically indicated brain MR imaging in which the parotid glands were sufficiently depicted. Regions of interest were obtained from both the left and right parotid glands. After the medical records were reviewed and exclusion criteria were used, 90 non-CTD and seven CTD patients (systemic lupus erythematosus = 5; discoid lupus erythematosus = 1; Sjogren syndrome = 1) remained. The two groups were then compared. Statistical analysis consisted of Wilcoxon sign rank and Mann-Whitney tests.; RESULTS: The combined mean ADC for both parotid glands in 90 healthy patients was 0.50 +- 0.28 x 10(-3) mm(2)s (95% CI, 0.44 x 10(-3), 0.56 x 10(-3)). The combined mean ADC for both parotid glands in the seven CTD patients was 0.96 +- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)s (95% CI, 0.79 x 10(-3), 1.14 x 10(-3)). The mean ADC for the CTD patients' parotid glands was significantly higher than that of the non-CTD patients (P = .0001), which suggests there is less restricted diffusion in parotid glands affected by CTD when compared with normal parotid glands.; CONCLUSION. These results suggest that ADCs may be used to detect parotid abnormalities in patients with CTD that are not identified by standard imaging. Although preliminary, the results indicate a potential role for ADC mapping in detection of subclinical parotid disease.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Prelemniscal radiation (Raprl) lesions and deep brain stimulation effectively control motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, but individual variations in the stereotactic location of its fiber components constitute a significant concern. The objective of this study was to determine individual variations in the stereotactic location of fiber tracts composing Raprl.
METHODS: Raprl fiber composition was determined in a group of 10 Parkinson patients and 10 matched controls using 3T magnetic resonance imaging, brain imaging processed for diffusion-weighted images, tract density imaging, and constrained spherical deconvolution. The stereotactic position of the point of maximal proximity (PMP), which is the point where the most significant number of fibers is concentrated in the smallest volume in the tractography, was evaluated in the right and left hemispheres of the same person, between individuals and between patients and controls for each tract in coordinates "x," "y," and "z." The stereotactic coordinates at which PMP of all tracts meet were statistically determined, representing the recommended aim for this target.; RESULTS: Stereotactic coordinates of the 3 fiber tracts composing Raprl, cerebellar-thalamic-cortical, globus pallidus-peduncle-pontine nucleus, and mesencephalic-orbital frontal cortex, did not vary between right and left hemispheres in the same person and between patients and controls. In contrast, PMP variability between individuals was significant, mainly for the mesencephalic-orbitofrontal tract. Therefore, probabilistic tractography can better determine individual variations to plan electrode trajectories.; CONCLUSIONS: Individual PMP variations for fiber tracts in Raprl, identified by probabilistic tractography, provide a platform for planning the stereotactic approach to conform volumes for deep brain stimulation and lesions.

N2  -  Background: A subgroup of patients with nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has no evidence of hippocampal sclerosis on standard temporal lobe protocol MRI. Objective: To investigate whether interictal diffusion-weighted imaging adds lateralizing information in patients with TLE with and without lateralizing conventional MRI. Methods: We studied 22 patients (9 right, 13 left TLE) who had undergone temporal lobectomy and 18 control subjects. We measured hippocampal volumes on high-resolution coronal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo scans. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) for the entire hippocampus and three arbitrarily defined areas of interest within the hippocampal head, body, and tail were measured from the coregistered ADC map. Pathology was reviewed and correlated with imaging findings. Results: Fourteen of 22 patients had hippocampal atrophy on MRI (defined as volume asymmetry greater than 2 SDs compared with asymmetry in the control group). Overall, resected hippocampi (n = 22) were significantly smaller than contralateral hippocampi as well as ipsilateral hippocampi in controls. ADCs were significantly higher in resected hippocampi than contralateral hippocampi as well as ipsilateral hippocampi in controls. These differences were also observed within the three areas of interest. ADCs in the hippocampi contralateral to the epileptogenic zone (n = 22) were also higher than in ipsilateral hippocampi in controls. In the subgroup of eight patients with nonlateralizing conventional MRIs, ADCs of resected hippocampi were not significantly different compared with the contralateral side. Pathology in these patients revealed gliosis only without apparent neuron loss. Conclusion: Interictal apparent diffusion coefficients confirm lateralization in patients with hippocampal atrophy on standard temporal lobe protocol MRI. However, they do not provide lateralizing information in patients with nonlateralizing conventional MRI.

N2  -  Purpose: Differentiating ischemic brain damage is critical for decision making in acute stroke treatment for better outcomes. We examined the sensitivity of amide proton transfer (APT) MRI, a pH-weighted imaging technique, to achieve this differentiation. Methods: In a rat stroke model, the ischemic core, oligemia, and the infarct-growth region (IGR) were identified by tracking the progression of the lesions. APT MRI signals were measured alongside ADC, T-1, and T-2 maps to evaluate their sensitivity in distinguishing ischemic tissues. Additionally, stroke under hyperglycemic conditions was studied. Results: The APT signal in the IGR decreased by about 10% shortly after stroke onset, and further decreased to 35% at 5 h, indicating a progression from mild to severe acidosis as the lesion evolved into infarction. Although ADC, T-1, and T-2 contrasts can only detect significant differences between the IGR and oligemia for a portion of the stroke duration, APT contrast consistently differentiates between them at all time points. However, the contrast to variation ratio at 1 h is only about 20% of the contrast to variation ratio between the core and normal tissues, indicating limited sensitivity. In the ischemic core, the APT signal decreases to about 45% and 33% of normal tissue level at 1 h for the normoglycemic and hyperglycemic groups, respectively, confirming more severe acidosis under hyperglycemia. Conclusion: The sensitivity of APT MRI is high in detecting severe acidosis of the ischemic core but is much lower in detecting mild acidosis, which may affect the accuracy of differentiation between the IGR and oligemia.

N2  -  Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of awake brain surgery for benign glial brain tumours in the Department of Neurosurgery of the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw. Materials and methods: Between 2020 and 2021, 9 out of 17 patients with a radiological diagnosis of a low-grade glioma located within or in the vicinity of eloquent brain areas were operated on under awake conditions. The average preoperative tumour volume was 29.6 cm(3). Preoperative management included a repeat magnetic resonance imaging supplemented with functional magnetic resonance imaging and tractography, as well as neuropsychological assessment. The cortex and subcortical structures were stimulated intraoperatively at 1.5-4 mA. The intraoperative assessment covered: motor functions, speech, and, additionally in two patients, visual field width and contralateral neglect. Results: Based on magnetic resonance imaging on the first postoperative day, complete removal of the tumour was confirmed in 7 patients. In 2 patients, resection was subtotal due to the fact that part of the tumour that infiltrated eloquent structures was left. In 6 patients, transient neurological deterioration was observed in the early perioperative period, which resolved within 2 months after surgery. In 3 patients, histopathological examination revealed a tumour with a higher grade of malignancy than expected. Conclusions: Our experience confirms that surgical treatment of benign glial tumours using direct electrical stimulation in awake patients is an effective and safe method allowing effective tumour resection with a minimised risk of adverse neurological sequelae.

N2  -  Purpose: Understanding how mechanical properties relate to functional changes in glioblastomas may help explain different treatment response between patients. The aim of this study was to map differences in biome-chanical and functional properties between tumor and healthy tissue, to assess any relationship between them and to study their spatial distribution.
Methods: Ten patients with glioblastoma and 17 healthy subjects were scanned using MR Elastography, perfusion and diffusion MRI. Stiffness and viscosity measurements G' and G '', cerebral blood flow (CBF), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in patients' contrast-enhancing tumor, necrosis, edema, and gray and white matter, and in gray and white matter for healthy subjects. A regression analysis was used to predict CBF as a function of ADC, FA, G' and G ''.; Results: Median G' and G' ' in contrast-enhancing tumor were 13% and 37% lower than in normal-appearing white matter (P < 0.01), and 8% and 6% lower in necrosis than in contrast-enhancing tumor, respectively (P < 0.05). Tumors showed both inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity. Measurements approached values in normalappearing tissue when moving outward from the tumor core, but abnormal tissue properties were still present in regions of normal-appearing tissue. Using both a linear and a random-forest model, prediction of CBF was improved by adding MRE measurements to the model (P < 0.01).; Conclusions: The inclusion of MRE measurements in statistical models helped predict perfusion, with stiffer tissue associated with lower perfusion values.

N2  -  Purpose: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease that can affect the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are found in 25-70% of patients. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) various studies have reported changes in white matter integrity in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSLE patients). The purpose of this study was to investigate, if regional changes in white matter integrity can also be detected in SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms (non-NPSLE patients).
Methods: Applying DTI and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) we investigated 19 NPSLE patients, 19 non-NPSLE and 18 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age and sex. Image pre-processing was performed using FSL, following the TBSS pipeline (eddy current correction, estimation of fractional anisotropy (FA), normalization, skeletonization of the group mean FA image). A general linear model with threshold-free cluster enhancement was used to assess significant differences between the three groups.; Results: Statistical analyses revealed several regions of decreased prefrontal white matter integrity (decreased FA) in both groups of SLE patients. The changes found in the non-NPSLE patients (as compared to healthy controls) overlapped with those in the NPSLE patients, but were not as pronounced.; Conclusions: Our data suggest that changes in regional white matter integrity, in terms of a decrease in FA, are present not only in NPSLE patients, but also in non-NPSLE patients, though to a lesser degree. We also demonstrate that the way statistical maps are corrected for multiple comparisons has a profound influence on whether alterations in white matter integrity in non-NPSLE patients are deemed significant.

N2  -  P>Purpose:
In comparison to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), TLE patients without HS (TLE-NH) have a similar clinical course but may result in worse surgical outcome. We investigated whether the clinical features related to the lack of HS in TLE patients (TLE-NH) can be explained by water diffusion abnormalities throughout diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by voxel-based analysis.; Methods:; Nineteen patients with TLE-HS (leftright TLE 12:7), 18 patients with TLE-NH (leftright TLE 10:8), and 20 controls were included in the study. By statistical parametric mapping (SPM2), the diffusion properties specific to disease characteristics (TLE-HS vs. TLE-NH) were analyzed.; Results:; In TLE-HS, we found the areas of increased mean diffusivity (MD) in their ipsilateral temporal and extratemporal areas including the hippocampus, parahippocampal, and frontoparietal regions. Left TLE-HS showed a characteristic MD increase in the ipsilateral posterior cingulum, isthmus of corpus callosum, and contralateral occipital and temporal regions, which was not observed in right TLE-HS group. In left TLE-NH, two regions of increased MD were observed in the ipsilateral posterior fornix (within fusiform gyrus) and posterior cingulum. Right TLE-NH did not show any increased MD.; Discussion:; In left TLE-NH, we could find the water diffusion change along the posterior cingulum, which was quite different from the extensive abnormality from TLE-HS. In addition, there was a lesion-side-specific distribution (left predominant) of pathology in mesial TLE. This provides a possibility that TLE-NH is a heterogenous or entity different from TLE-HS.

T2  -  CURRENT PAIN AND HEADACHE REPORTS

N2  -  Purpose of Review Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are common vascular abnormalities often discovered on imaging as an incidental finding. The most common clinical presentations of CCMs include seizure, headache, focal neurological deficits, and intracranial hemorrhage. This article discusses the most recent guidelines including imaging diagnostic criteria and radiographic standards of CCMs and reviews the utility of currently available imaging techniques.
Recent Findings Gradient echo T2*-weighted imaging and susceptibility-weighted imaging are the recommended imaging protocols for evaluation of suspected CCMs. Diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography provides visualization of the eloquent white matter tracks in the brain. This imaging is increasingly used in clinical practice to assist in selecting the optimal surgical approach, especially for brainstem lesions. Quantitative susceptibility mapping and dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion are presently considered experimental. Its proposed value might prove helpful in the future to monitor disease activity and response to treatments.; Summary The choice of imaging modality of CCMs depends on the goals the clinician expects to achieve, such as establishing the initial diagnosis, follow-up and monitoring disease activity, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative evaluation, or research and experimental work on patients with CCM.

N2  -  Dysregulations in the expression level of Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) and K-Cl cotransporter (KCC2) genes have been detected in the brain tissues of patients with refractory epilepsy. Given the importance of these proteins in the determination of Cl- equilibrium potential (E-Cl), evaluation of the expression changes of these transporters might assist in optimizing the diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies. The present investigation evaluates the expression level chloride transporters in polymorphonuclear cells and their correlation with microstructural abnormalities. Thirty cases of drug-resistant epilepsy (confirmed with temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosis) fulfilled the considered inclusion criteria. Cases were divided into two groups, one with a detectable MRI lesion (19 participants; right side) and another with no MRI findings (11 participants). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis was performed on diffusion tensor imaging to measure fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity; neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging was performed to map neurite density index and orientation dispersion index. Our results indicated that fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity changed in temporal and extratemporal parts of the brain, whereas the changes in neurite density index and orientation dispersion index were exclusively obvious in the temporal lobe. Molecular studies revealed significantly lower levels of KCC2 expression in patients with epilepsy, a finding that remarkably correlated with microstructural changes as well. Our research showed that downregulation of KCC2 and microstructural abnormalities might contribute to the observed refractoriness in temporal lobe epilepsy.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  Neuroimaging studies have revealed associations between intelligence and brain morphology. However, researchers have focused primarily on the anatomical features of the cerebral cortex, whereas subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia (BG), have often been neglected despite extensive functional evidence on their relation with higher-order cognition. Here we performed shape analyses to understand how individual differences in BG local morphology account for variability in cognitive performance. Structural MRI was acquired in 104 young adults (45 men, 59 women, mean age = 19.83, SD = 1.64), and the outer surface of striatal structures (caudate, nucleus accumbens, and putamen), globus pallidus, and thalamus was estimated for each subject and hemisphere. Further, nine cognitive tests were used to measure fluid (Gf), crystallized (Gc), and spatial intelligence (Gv). Latent scores for these factors were computed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and regressed vertex-wise against subcortical shape (local displacements of vertex position), controlling for age, sex, and adjusted for brain size. Significant results (FDR < 5%) were found for Gf and Gv, but not Gc, for the right striatal structures and thalamus. The main results show a relative enlargement of the rostral putamen, which is functionally connected to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other intelligence-related prefrontal areas.

N2  -  The relationship between stroke topography and functional outcome has largely been studied with binary manual lesion segmentations. However, stroke topography may be better characterized by continuous variables capable of reflecting the severity of ischemia, which may be more pertinent for long-term outcome. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) constitutes a powerful means of quantifying the degree of acute ischemia and its potential relation to functional outcome. Our aim was to investigate whether using more clinically pertinent imaging parameters with powerful machine learning techniques could improve prediction models and thus provide valuable insight on critical brain areas important for long-term outcome. Eighty-seven thrombolyzed patients underwent a DTI sequence at 24 h post-stroke. Functional outcome was evaluated at 3 months post-stroke with the modified Rankin Score and was dichotomized into good (mRS <= 2) and poor (mRS > 2) outcome. We used support vector machines (SVM) to classify patients into good vs. poor outcome and evaluate the accuracy of different models built with fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity asymmetry maps, and lesion segmentations in combination with lesion volume, age, recanalization status, and thrombectomy treatment. SVM classifiers built with axial diffusivity maps yielded the best accuracy of all imaging parameters (median [IQR] accuracy = 82.8 [79.3-86.21%), compared to that of lesion segmentations (76.7 [73.3-82.81%) when predicting 3-month functional outcome. The analysis revealed a strong contribution of clinical variables, notably - in descending order - lesion volume, thrombectomy treatment, and recanalization status, in addition to the deep white matter at the crossroads of major white matter tracts, represented by brain regions where model weights were highest. Axial diffusivity is a more appropriate imaging marker to characterize stroke topography for predicting long-term outcome than binary lesion segmentations.

N2  -  This study aims to evaluate the differentiated effectiveness of MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to postoperative recurrent glioma and radiation injury.
Conventional MRI and DTI examination were performed using Siemens 3.0 T MR System for patients with new contrast-enhancing lesions at the site of treated tumor with postoperative radiotherapy. The region of interest was manually drawn on ADC and FA maps at contrast-enhancing lesion area, peri-lesion edema, and the contra-lateral normal white matter. Then ADC and FA values were measured and, the ADC ratio and FA ratio were calculated. Twenty patients with recurrent tumor and 15 with radiation injury were confirmed by histopathologic examination (23 patients) and clinical imaging follow-up (12 patients), respectively. The mean ADC ratio and FA ratio were compared between the two lesion types.; The mean ADC ratio at contrast-enhancing lesion area was significantly lower in patients with recurrent tumor (1.34 +- 0.15) compared to that with radiation injury (1.62 +- 0.17; P < 0.01). The mean FA ratio at contrast-enhancing lesion area was significantly higher in patients with recurrent tumor (0.45 +- 0.03) compared to that with radiation injury (0.32 +- 0.03; P < 0.01). Neither mean ADC ratio nor FA ratio in edema areas had statistical difference between the two groups. A recurrent tumor was suggested when either ADC ratio < 1.65 orand FA ratio > 0.36 at contrast-enhancing lesion area according to the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Three patients with recurrent tumor and two with radiation injury were misclassified.; DTI is a valuable method to distinguish postoperative recurrent glioma and radiation injury.

N2  -  Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disease, causing lesions that disrupt the brain's anatomical and physiological connectivity networks, resulting in cognitive, visual and/or motor disabilities. Advanced imaging techniques like diffusion and functional MRI allow measurement of the brain's structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks, and can enable a better understanding of how their disruptions cause disability in people with MS (pwMS). However, advanced MRI techniques are used mainly for research purposes as they are expensive, time-consuming and require high-level expertise to acquire and process. As an alternative, the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool can be used to estimate SC and FC using lesion masks derived from pwMS and a reference set of controls' connectivity networks.
Objective: Here, we test the hypothesis that estimated SC and FC (eSC and eFC) from the NeMo Tool, based only on an individual's lesion masks, can be used to classify pwMS into disability categories just as well as SC and FC extracted from advanced MRI directly in pwMS. We also aim to find the connections most important for differentiating between no disability vs evidence of disability groups.; Materials and Methods: One hundred pwMS (age:45.5 +- 11.4 years, 66% female, disease duration: 12.97 +- 8.07 years) were included in this study. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to assess disability, 67 pwMS had no disability (EDSS < 2). Observed SC and FC were extracted from diffusion and functional MRI directly in pwMS, respectively. The NeMo Tool was used to estimate the remaining structural connectome (eSC), by removing streamlines in a reference set of tractograms that intersected the lesion mask. The NeMo Tool's eSC was used then as input to a deep neural network to estimate the corresponding FC (eFC). Logistic regression with ridge regularization was used to classify pwMS into disability categories (no disability vs evidence of disability), based on demographicsclinical information (sex, age, race, disease duration, clinical phenotype, and spinal lesion burden) and either pairwise entries or regional summaries from one of the following matrices: SC, FC, eSC, and eFC. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the classification performance. Both univariate statistics and parameter coefficients from the classification models were used to identify features important to differentiating between the groups.; Results: The regional eSC and eFC models outperformed their observed FC and SC counterparts (p-value < 0.05), while the pairwise eSC and SC performed similarly (p = 0.10). Regional eSC and eFC models had higher AUC (0.66-0.68) than the pairwise models (0.60-0.65), with regional eFC having highest classification accuracy across all models. Ridge regression coefficients for the regional eFC and regional observed FC models were significantly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.52, p-value < 10e-7). Decreased estimated SC node strength in default mode and ventral attention networks and increased eFC node strength in visual networks was associated with evidence of disability.; Discussion: Here, for the first time, we use clinically acquired lesion masks to estimate both structural and functional connectomes in patient populations to better understand brain lesion-dysfunction mapping in pwMS. Models based on the NeMo Tool's estimates of SC and FC better classified pwMS by disability level than SC and FC observed directly in the individual using advanced MRI. This work provides a viable alternative to performing high-cost, advanced MRI in patient populations, bringing the connectome one step closer to the clinic.

N2  -  AIM: To explore the clinical value of combining pyramidal tract mapping, microscopic-based neuronavigation, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in the surgical treatment of epileptic foci involving sensorimotor cortex.
MATERIAL and METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 69 patients with focal epilepsy involving motor and sensory cortex. The surgical operations in Group I (n=38) were performed under the guidance of conventional neuronavigation, and the operations of Group II (n=31) were aided by combining pyramidal tract mapping, microscopic-based neuronavigation and the iMRI technique. Chi square test was used to compare seizure outcome and neurological deficits across groups.; RESULTS: 7 patients (18.4%) in Group I, and 3 patients (9.7%) in Group II didn't recover to the level of preoperative strength within one year post-operation. The 2-year follow-up survey showed that more patients in Group II compared to Group I(71% vs. 55.3%, p=0.181) had a good outcome (Engel class I similar to II).; CONCLUSION:The techniques of combining pyramidal tract mapping, microscopic-based neuronavigation and iMRI aid in precise mapping and hence resection of epileptic foci in sensorimotor cortex, which lead to improvement of surgical efficacy and significant reduction of postoperative loss of function.

N2  -  Methanol intoxication is rare in developed countries. Early identification and elimination of the methanol metabolites are vital to an optimal prognosis. A characteristic brain imaging finding is bilateral basal ganglia necrosis and subcortical white matter changes. Here, we report a rare neuroradiological feature called the lentiform fork sign in a patient with methanol intoxication who survived the acute poisoning stage. We report a 31-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with acute-onset incoherent speech, consciousness disturbance, and a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis caused by methanol intoxication. She was treated with antidote administration of fomepizole and enhanced methanol elimination through hemodialysis. Neurological sequelae of cognitive decline and parkinsonism developed, with preserved vision. Brain MRI showed bilateral putaminal necrosis and subcortical white matter changes. The apparent diffusion coefficient map showed low signal intensities in the putamen and globus pallidus bilaterally, with brightly hyperintense rims surrounding both putamina that resembled a fork, indicating a lentiform fork sign. She then had sequelae of cognitive decline and delayed parkinsonism feature, which are compatible with the brain lesions on neuroimage studies. Methanol poisoning is an uncommon life-threatening event, and neurological sequelae result from the accumulation of formic acid, a methanol metabolite that inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria, leading to neuronal injury. Methanol intoxication should be considered in patients with imaging findings of bilateral basal ganglia necrosis with lentiform fork sign and a metabolic acidosis of unknown origin.

N2  -  Background We have recently shown that the presence of headache in ischemic stroke is associated with lesions of the insular cortex. The aim of this post-hoc subgroup analysis was to investigate the association of specific headache features with stroke location in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
Methods In this observational study, patients (mean age: 61.5, 58% males) with ischemic stroke and acute headache (n=49) were investigated. Infarcts were manually outlined on 3D diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and transformed into standard stereotaxic space; lesions of the left hemisphere were mirrored in the x-axis to allow a voxel-wise group analysis of all patients. We analyzed the association of lesion location and the following phenotypical characteristics by voxel-based symptom lesion mapping: Headache intensity, different qualities of headache (pulsating, tension-type like and stabbing), and the presence of nausea, of cranial autonomic symptoms and of light or noise sensitivity.; Results Headache intensity was associated with lesions of the posterior insula, the operculum and the cerebellum. Pulsating headache occurred with widespread cortical and subcortical strokes. The presence of tension-like and stabbing headache was not related to specific lesion patterns. Nausea was associated with lesions in the posterior circulation territory. Cranial-autonomic symptoms were related to lesions of the parietal lobe, the somatosensory cortex (SI) and the middle temporal cortex. The presence of noise sensitivity was associated with cerebellar lesions, whereas light sensitivity was not related to specific lesions in our sample.; Conclusion Headache phenotype in ischemic stroke appears to be related to specific ischemic lesion patterns.

N2  -  Neurosurgeons should know the anatomy required for safe temporal lobe surgery approaches. The present study aimed to determine the angles and distances necessary to reach the temporal stem and tem-poral horn in surgical approaches for safe temporal lobe surgery by using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging technique in post-mortem human brain hemispheres fixed by the Klingler method. In our study, 10 post-mortem human brain hemisphere specimens were fixed according to the Klingler method. Magnetic resonance images were obtained using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner after fixa-tion. Surgical measurements were conducted for the temporal stem and temporal horn by magnetic res-onance imaging, and dissection was then performed under a surgical microscope for the temporal stem. Each stage of dissection was achieved in high-quality three-dimensional images. The angles and distances to reach the temporal stem and temporal horn were measured in transcortical T1, trans-sulcal T1-2, transcortical T2, trans-sulcal T2-3, transcortical T3, and subtemporal trans-collateral sulcus approaches. The safe maximum posterior entry point for anterior temporal lobectomy was measured as 47.16 +/- 5.0 0 mm. Major white-matter fibers in this region and their relations with each other are shown. The dis-tances to the temporal stem and temporal horn, which are important in temporal lobe surgical interven-tions, were measured radiologically, and safe borders were determined. Surgical strategy and preoperative planning should consider the relationship of the lesion and white-matter pathways. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  In this study, we compared the standardized value of each signal intensity, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that digitizes the diffusion of water molecules, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) using b value 0 400, 1400 (s/mm(2)). From March 2013 to December 2013, patients with suspicion of simple compound fracture and metastatic spine cancer were included in the MR readout. We used a 1.5 Tesla Achieva MRI system and a SynSpine Coil. Sequence is a DWI SE-EPI sagittal (diffusion weighted imaging spin echo -echo planar imaging sagittal) image with b-factor (s/mm(2)) 0, 400, 1400 were used. Data analysis showed ROI (Region of Interest) in diseased area with high SI (signal intensity) in diffusion-weighted image b value 0 (s/mm(2)) Using the MRIcro program, each SI was calculated with images of b-value 0, 400, and 1400 (s/mm(2)), ADC map was obtained using Metlab Software with each image of b-value, The ADC is obtained by applying the ROI to the same position. The standardized values (SI400/SI0, SI400/SI0) of simple compression fractures were 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 0.23 0.03 and the standardized values (SI400/SI0, SI400/SI0) of the metastatic spine were 0.57 +/- 0.07 and 0.32 0.08 And the standardized values of the two diseases were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The ADC (mm(2)/s) for b value 400 (s/mm(2)) and 1400 (s/mm(2)) of the simple compression fracture disease site were 1.70 +/- 0.16 and 0.93 +/- 0.28 and 1.24 +/- 0.21 and 0.80 +/- 0.15 for the metastatic spine. The ADC (mm(2)/s) for b value 400 (s/mm(2)) was statistically significant (p < 0.05) but the ADC (mm(2)/s) for b value 1400 (p > 0.05). In conclusion, multi - b value recognition of signal changes in diffusion - weighted imaging is very important for the diagnosis of various spinal diseases.

N2  -  Background Conventional MRI fails to detect regions of glioblastoma cell infiltration beyond the contrast-enhanced T-1 solid tumor region, with infiltrating tumor cells often migrating along host blood vessels. Purpose To quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the correlation between perfusion MRI signal and tumor cell density in order to assess whether local perfusion perturbation could provide a useful biomarker of glioblastoma cell infiltration. Study Type Animal model. Subjects Mice bearing orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts generated from a patient-derived glioblastoma cell line. Field Strength/Sequences 7T perfusion images acquired using a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) multiple boli arterial spin labeling sequence were compared with conventional MRI (T-1/T-2 weighted, contrast-enhanced T-1, diffusion-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient). Assessment Immunohistochemistry sections were stained for human leukocyte antigen (probing human-derived tumor cells). To achieve quantitative MRI-tissue comparison, multiple histological slices cut in the MRI plane were stacked to produce tumor cell density maps acting as a "ground truth." Statistical Tests Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Dice similarity indices were calculated and a two-tailed, paired t-test used for statistical analysis. Results High comparison test results (Dice 0.62-0.72, Accuracy 0.86-0.88, Sensitivity 0.51-0.7, and Specificity 0.92-0.97) indicate a good segmentation for all imaging modalities and highlight the quality of the MRI tissue assessment protocol. Perfusion imaging exhibits higher sensitivity (0.7) than conventional MRI (0.51-0.61). MRI/histology voxel-to-voxel comparison revealed a negative correlation between tumor cell infiltration and perfusion at the tumor margins (P = 0.0004). Data Conclusion These results demonstrate the ability of perfusion imaging to probe regions of low tumor cell infiltration while confirming the sensitivity limitations of conventional imaging modalities. The quantitative relationship between tumor cell density and perfusion identified in and beyond the edematous T-2 hyperintensity region surrounding macroscopic tumor could be used to detect marginal tumor cell infiltration with greater accuracy.

In 43 evaluable patients, single slice whole PZ, TZ and tumour focal hypointense signal on T2W images in a biopsy-positive octant) regions of interest were transferred to T-2 and ADC maps by slice matching. T-2 and ADC values were correlated, and PZ values were correlated with PZFV.; Results: T-2 and ADC values were significantly different among groups T-2 mean +- standard deviation (SD) PZ, 149 +- 49ms; TZ, 125 +- 26ms; tumour, 97 +- 23ms; PZ vs TZ, p=0.002; PZ vs tumour, p<0.0001; TZ vs tumour, p<0.0001; ADCx10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) mean +- SD PZ, 1680 +- 215; TZ, 1478 +- 139; tumour, 1030 +- 205; p<0.0001. Significant positive correlations existed between T-2 and ADC for PZ, TZ, PZ and TZ together, but not for tumour (r=0.515, p<0.0001; r=0.300, p=0.03; r=0.526, p<0.0001; and r=0.239, p=0.32, respectively). No significant correlation existed between PZFV and PZ T-2 (r=0.10, p=0.5) or ADC (r=0.03, p=0.8).; Conclusion: The correlation between T-2 and ADC that exists in normal prostate is absent in tumour. PZ compression by an enlarged TZ does not alter PZ T-2 or ADC to affect tumourPZ contrast.; Advances in Knowledge: Microstructural features of tumours alter diffusivity independently of their effects on T-2 relaxation.

N2  -  Objectives: Injury to major white matter pathways during language-area associated glioma surgery often leads to permanent loss of neurological function. The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery.
Methods: We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus AF, Frontal Aslant Tract FAT, Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus IFOF, Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus ILF, Uncinate Fasciculus UF) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery.; Results: In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stemperi-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 - 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 - 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia.; Conclusions: Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile presurgically. The TPO and temporal stemperi-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.

N2  -  Background: Early detection of treatment response is important for the management of patients with malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma to assure good quality of life in relation to therapeutic efficacy.Aim: To investigate whether parametric response mapping (PRM) with diffusion MRI may provide prognostic information at an early stage of standard therapy for glioblastoma.Materials and methods: This prospective study included 31 patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma WHO grade IV, planned for primary standard postoperative treatment with radiotherapy 60Gy/30 fractions with concomitant and adjuvant Temozolomide. MRI follow-up including diffusion and perfusion weighting was performed at 3 T at start of postoperative chemoradiotherapy, three weeks into treatment, and then regularly until twelve months postoperatively. Regional mean diffusivity (MD) changes were analyzed voxel-wise using the PRM method (MD-PRM). At eight and twelve months postoperatively, after completion of standard treatment, patients were classified using conventional MRI and clinical evaluation as either having stable disease (SD, including partial response) or progressive disease (PD). It was assessed whether MD-PRM differed between patients having SD versus PD and whether it predicted the risk of disease progression (progression-free survival, PFS) or death (overall survival, OS). A subgroup analysis was performed that compared MD-PRM between SD and PD in patients only undergoing diagnostic biopsy. MGMT-promotor methylation status (O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase) was registered and analyzed with respect to PFS, OS and MD-PRM.Results: Of the 31 patients analyzed: 21 were operated by resection and ten by diagnostic biopsy. At eight months, 19 patients had SD and twelve had PD. At twelve months, ten patients had SD and 20 had PD, out of which ten were deceased within twelve months and one was deceased without known tumor progression. Median PFS was nine months, and median OS was 17 months. Eleven patients had methylated MGMT-promotor, 16 were MGMT unmethylated, and four had unknown MGMT-status. MD-PRM did not significantly predict patients having SD versus PD neither at eight nor at twelve months. Patients with an above median MD-PRM reduction had a slightly longer PFS (P = 0.015) in Kaplan-Maier analysis, as well as a non-significantly longer OS (P = 0.099). In the subgroup of patients only undergoing biopsy, total MD-PRM change at three weeks was generally higher for patients with SD than for patients with PD at eight months, although no tests were performed. MGMT status strongly predicted both PFS and OS but not MD-PRM change.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion- (DW) and perfusion-weighted (PW) MR imaging reflect neurophysiologic changes during stroke evolution. We sought to determine parameters that distinguish regions of brain destined for infarction from those that will survive despite hypoperfusion.
METHODS: DW and PW images were obtained in 30 patients at 1-12 hours after symptom onset. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), flow (rCBF), mean transit time (MTT), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), DW image signal intensity, and fractional anisotropy (FA) lesion-contralateral normal region ratios were obtained in the following regions: 1) infarct core with hyperintensity on DW image, abnormality on rCBF and MTT images, and follow-up abnormality; 2) infarcted penumbra with normal DW image, abnormal rCBF and MTT images, and follow-up abnormality; and 3) hypoperfused tissue that remained viable, with normal DW image, abnormal rCBF and MTT images, and normal follow-up.; RESULTS: rCBF ratios for regions 1, 2, and 3 were 0.32 +- 0.11, 0.46 +- 0.13, and 0.58 +- 0.12, respectively, and were significantly different. DW image intensity and ADC ratios were significantly different among all regions, but were more similar than rCBF ratios. rCBV and FA ratios were not significantly different between regions 2 and 3. No MTT ratios were significantly different. No region of interest with an rCBF ratio less than 0.36, an rCBV ratio less than 0.53, an ADC ratio less than 0.85, a DW image intensity ratio greater than 1.23, or an FA ratio greater than 1.10 remained viable. No region of interest with an rCBF ratio greater than 0.79 infarcted.; CONCLUSIONS: Differences among mean ratios of three regions investigated were greatest for. the rCBF ratio. The rCBF ratio may be the most useful parameter in differentiating viable tissue that is likely to infarct without intervention, from tissue that will survive despite hypoperfusion. ADC, DW intensity, FA, and rCBV ratios may provide adjunctive information.

N2  -  Insular lesions remain surgically challenging because of the need to balance aggressive resection and functional protection. Motor function deficits due to corticospinal tract injury are a common complication of surgery for lesions adjacent to the internal capsule and it is therefore essential to evaluate the corticospinal tract adjacent to the lesion. We used diffusion tensor imaging to evaluate the corticospinal tract in 89 patients with insular lobe lesions who underwent surgery in Chinese PLA General Hospital from February 2009 to May 2011. Postoperative motor function evaluation revealed that 57 patients had no changes in motor function, and 32 patients suffered motor dysfunction or aggravated motor dysfunction. Of the affected patients, 20 recovered motor function during the 6-12-month follow-up, and an additional 12 patients did not recover over more than 12 months of follow-up. Following reconstruction of the corticospinal tract, fractional anisotropy comparison demonstrated that preoperative, intraoperative and follow-up normalized fractional anisotropy in the stable group was higher than in the transient deficits group or the long-term deficits group. Compared with the transient deficits group, intraoperative normalized fractional anisotropy significantly decreased in the long-term deficits group. We conclude that intraoperative fractional anisotropy values of the corticospinal tracts can be used as a prognostic indicator of motor function outcome.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: The authors analyzed the current-intensity thresholds for electrostimulation of language fasciculi and the possible consequences of threshold variability on brain mapping.
METHODS: A prospective protocol of subcortical electrostimulation was used in 50 patients undergoing brain mapping, directly stimulating presumed language fasciculi identified by diffusion tensor imaging.; RESULTS: The stimulation-intensity thresholds for identification of language fasciculi varied among patients (mean minimum current intensity of 4.4 mA, range = 1.5-10 mA, standard deviation = 1.1 mA), and 23% of fascicular interferences were detected only above 5 mA. Repeated stimulation of the same site with the same intensity led to different types of interferences in 20% of patients, and a higher current intensity led to changes in the type of response in 27%. The mean minimum stimulation intensities did not differ significantly between different fasciculi, between the different types of interference obtained, or with age, sex, or type of tumor. Positive results on cortical mapping were significantly associated with positive results on subcortical mapping (P < 0.001). Subcortical intensity thresholds were slightly lower than cortical ones (mean = 4.43 vs. 5.25 mA, P = 0.034). In 23 of 50 subcortical mappings, fascicular stimulation produced no language interference.; CONCLUSIONS: Individual variability of minimum stimulation-intensity thresholds for identification of language fasciculi is frequent. Nevertheless, even when a high current intensity was used, many stimulations on language fasciculi remained negative for various hypothetic reasons. Finding the optimal current intensity for identifying language fasciculi is of paramount importance to refine the clinical results and scientific data derived from brain mapping.

N2  -  Our aim in this study was to explore the neural substrates of executive function in frontal and nonfrontal white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We Studied the relationship between executive dysfunction and DTI measurements on 13 subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 11 subjects with early Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 16 control Subjects. All participants underwent an examination of their intelligence, memory, and executive function and were subjected to DTI Both aMCI and early AD subjects showed executive function impairment with differential performance in frontal-related behaviors. Both aMCI and early AD subjects showed increased mean diffusivity in the genu of the corpus callosum and left frontal periventricular white matter (PVWM), whereas subjects with early AD showed an additional decrease in the fractional anisotropy of bilateral frontal PVWM and in the genu of the corpus callosum. The frontal PVWM was associated with performance on the Verbal Fluency Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and Part B of the Trail Making Test. The parietal PVWM was associated with perseverative errors on the WCST and Part A of the Trail Making Test. In summary, executive function was impaired in subjects with aMCI and early AD and was associated with frontal and parietal PVWM changes. These changes may be due to early AD degeneration of the lateral cholinergic projections or to early change of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3826-3836, 2009.

N2  -  Background: Neuropathologic studies suggest an association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and small ischemic infarctions as well as hemorrhages. We examined the prevalence and associated risk factors for infarcts detected by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).
Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of MR images from 78 subjects with a diagnosis of probable CAA and a similar aged group of 55 subjects with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment (ADMCI) for comparison. DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were inspected for acute or subacute infarcts. We also examined the association between DWI lesions and demographic variables, conventional vascular risk factors, and radiographic markers of CAA severity such as number of hemorrhages on gradient-echo MRI and volume of T2-hyperintense white matter lesions.; Results: Twelve of 78 subjects with CAA (15%) had a total of 17 DWI-hyperintense lesions consistent with subacute cerebral infarctions vs 0 of 55 subjects with ADMCI (p = 0.001). The DWI lesions were located primarily in cortex and subcortical white matter. CAA subjects with DWI lesions had a higher median number of total hemorrhages ( 22 vs 4, p = 0.025) and no difference in white matter hyperintensity volume or conventional vascular risk factors compared to subjects with CAA without lesions.; Conclusions: MRI evidence of small subacute infarcts is present in a substantial proportion of living patients with advanced cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( CAA). The presence of these lesions is associated with a higher burden of hemorrhages, but not with conventional vascular risk factors. This suggests that advanced CAA predisposes to ischemic infarction as well as intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurology(R) 2009; 72: 1230-1235

N2  -  The brain's myelin content can be mapped by T2-relaxometry, which resolves multiple differentially relaxing T2 pools from multi-echo MRI. Unfortunately, the conventional fitting procedure is a hard and numerically ill-posed problem. Consequently, the T2 distributions and myelin maps become very sensitive to noise and are frequently difficult to interpret diagnostically. Although regularization can improve stability, it is generally not adequate, particularly at relatively low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of around 100-200. The purpose of this study was to obtain a fitting algorithm which is able to overcome these difficulties and generate usable myelin maps from noisy acquisitions in a realistic scan time. To this end, we restrict the T2 distribution to only 3 distinct resolvable tissue compartments, modeled as Gaussians: myelin water, intra/extra-cellular water and a slow relaxing cerebrospinal fluid compartment. We also impose spatial smoothness expectation that volume fractions and T2 relaxation times of tissue compartments change smoothly within coherent brain regions. The method greatly improves robustness to noise, reduces spatial variations, improves definition of white matter fibers, and enhances detection of demyelinating lesions. Due to efficient design, the additional spatial aspect does not cause an increase in processing time. The proposed method was applied to fast spiral acquisitions on which conventional fitting gives uninterpretable results. While these fast acquisitions suffer from noise and inhomogeneity artifacts, our preliminary results indicate the potential of spatially constrained 3-pool T2 relaxometry.

N2  -  Purpose: To prospectively evaluate use of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps for determination of the consistency of macroadenomas.
Materials and Methods: The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty-two patients with pituitary macroadenoma (10 men, 12 women; mean age, 54 years +- 17.09 standard deviation: range, 21-75 years) were examined. All patients underwent MR examination, which included T1-weighted spin-echo and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo DW imagine with ADC mapping and contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo imaging. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the macroadenomas and in normal white matter on DW images, ADC maps, and conventional MR images. Consistency of macroadenomas was evaluated at surgery and was classified as soft, intermediate, or hard. Histologic examination was performed on surgical specimens of macroadenomas. Mean ADC values, signal intensity (SI) ratios of tumor to white matter within ROIs on conventional and DW MR images, and degree of enhancement were compared with tumor consistency and with percentage of collagen content at histologic examination by using analysis of variance for linear trend.; Results: The mean value of ADC in the soft group was (0.663 +- 0.109) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec: in the intermediate group, (0.842 +- 0.081) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec: and in the hard group, (1.363 +- 0.259) x 10(-3) mm(2)sec. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between tumor consistency and ADC values, DW image SI ratios, T2-weighted image SI ratios, and percentage of collagen content (P < .001, analysis of variance). No other statistically significant correlations were found.; Conclusion: Findings in this study suggest that DW MR images with ADC maps can provide information about the consistency of macroadenomas.

N2  -  CNS involvement in breast cancer modifies the prognosis and the treatment of the disease. Imaging plays a leading role for the diagnosis, the pretherapeutic assessment and the follow-up. MRI is the most sensitive modality for the detection of infraclinic lesions, reported in about 15% of metastatic breast cancers. In addition to conventional MR study, diffusion MR, perfusion MR and spectroscopy have a diagnostic value with specificity of more than 95%; 3D study is required if neurosurgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery is contemplated. The use of new drugs in clinical trials needs a precise and accurate follow up to assess their usefulness; appreciation of the response is based on the precise mesure of the number of targets and of their size; The WHO and recently the RECIST have established the guidelines for measurement of the tumoral targets and to assess the response to treatments. Brain modifications related to surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are well studied by MRI.

N2  -  Background: fMRI of mental phenomena is quite difficult to perform because lack of patient's cooperation or because the symptoms are stable. In some exceptional cases, however, fMRI and DTI are capable to provide insights on the anatomy of organic hallucinations. Methods: In this report we describe a 14-year-old boy with a left fronto-dorsal tumor who experienced chronic complex brief, frequent and repetitive complex visual and auditory hallucinations. His clinical picture included multiple and severe social and mood problems. During a presurgical fMRI mapping the patient complained of having the visual and auditory hallucinations. A block-design FMRI paradigm was obtained from the event timecourse. Deterministic DTI of the brain was obtained seeding the lesion as ROI. The patient underwent surgery and electrocorticography of the lesional area. Results: The fMRI of the hallucinations showed activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the peri-lesional area. The tractography of the tumor revealed structural aberrant connectivity to occipital and temporal areas in addition to the expected connectivity with the IFG via the aslant fasciculus and homotopic contralateral areas. Intraoperative EEG demonstrated epileptic discharges in the tumor and neighboring areas. After resection, the patient's hallucinations stopped completely. He regained his normal social life and recover his normal mood. He remained asymptomatic for 90 days. Afterwards, hallucinations reappeared but with less intensity. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combined functional and structural connectivity imaging demonstrating brain regions participating in a network involved in the generation of complex auditory and visual hallucinations.

N2  -  PurposeTo characterize the influence of perfusion on the measurement of diffusion changes over time when ADC is computed using standard two-point methods.
Materials and MethodsFunctional diffusion maps (FDMs), which depict changes in diffusion over time, were compared with rCBV changes in patients with brain tumors. The FDMs were created by coregistering and subtracting ADC maps from two time points and categorizing voxels where ADC significantly increased (iADC), decreased (dADC), or did not change (ncADC). Traditional FDMs (tFDMs) were computed using b = 0,1000 smm(2). Flow-compensated FDMs (fcFDMs) were calculated using b = 500,1000 smm(2). Perfusion's influence on FDMs was determined by evaluating changes in rCBV in areas where the ADC change significantly differed between the two FDMs.; ResultsThe mean rCBV in voxels that changed from iADC (dADC) on the tFDM to ncADC on the fcFDM was significantly greater (less) than zero. In addition, mean rCBV in iADC (dADC) voxels on the tFDM was significantly higher (lower) than in iADC (dADC) voxels on the fcFDM.; ConclusionThe ability to accurately identify changes in diffusion on traditional FDMs is confounded in areas where perfusion and diffusion changes are colocalized. Flow-compensated FDMs, which use only non-zero b-values, should therefore be the standard approach. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013;38:868-875. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Background: Intracranial tumors involving the temporo-occipital lobe often compress or destroy the optic radiation (OpR), resulting in decreased visual function. The aim of this study is to explore the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography integrated with neuronavigation to prevent visual damage when resecting tumors involving the OpR and find potential factors affecting patients' visual function and quality of life (QOL).
Methods: Our study is a cross-sectional study that included 28 patients with intracranial tumors in close morphological relationship with the OpR recruited between January 2020 and February 2022. The surgical incision and approach were preoperatively designed and adjusted according to the DTI tractography results and visual function scores. All patients underwent examinations of visual acuity (VA) and visual field index (VFI) and completed visual function and QOL scales at admission and 2 months after discharge. Logistic regression and linear regression analysis were conducted to evaluate clinical factors potentially affecting prepostoperative OpR morphology, VA, VFI, visual function, and QOL.; Results: Lesion size was the main factor found to affect visual function (beta = -0.74, 95%CI: -1.12 similar to 0.36, P = 0.05), VA (left: beta = -0.11, 95%CI: -0.14 similar to-0.08, P < 0.001; right: beta = -0.15, 95%CI: -0.17 similar to-0.13, P < 0.001), and VFI (left: beta = -0.11, 95%CI: - 0.14 similar to-0.08, P < 0.001; right: beta = -0.14, 95%CI: -0.16 similar to-0.12, P < 0.001). Lesion size, edema, and involvement of the lateral ventricle temporal horn were factors affecting OpR morphology and QOL. The 28 patients showed significantly improved VA, VFI, visual function, and QOL results (P < 0.05) 2 months after discharge.; Conclusions: Combining DTI of OpR mapping and microscopic-based neuronavigation aided precise mapping and thus preservation of visual function in patients undergoing tumor resection. Potential clinical factors affecting patients' visual function and QOL scores were identified which are useful for assessing a patient's condition and predicting prognosis.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  Free water fraction (FWF) represents the amount of water per unit volume of brain parenchyma, which is not bound to macromolecules. Its excess in multiple sclerosis (MS) is related to increased tissue loss. The use of mcDESPOT (multicomponent driven single pulse observation of T1 and T2), a 3D imaging method which exploits both the T1 and T2 contrasts, allows FWF to be derived in clinically feasible times. However, this method has not been used to quantify changes of FWF and their potential clinical impact in MS. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in FWF in MS patients and their relationship with tissue damage and cognition, under the hypothesis that FWF is a proxy of clinically meaningful tissue loss. To this aim, we tested the relationship between FWF, MS lesion burden and information processing speed, evaluated via the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). In addition to standard sequences, used for T1- and T2-weighted lesion delineation, the mcDESPOT sequence with 1.7 mm isotropic resolution and a diffusion weighted imaging protocol (b = 0, 1200 s/mm(2), 40 diffusion directions) were employed at 3 T. The fractional anisotropy map derived from diffusion data was used to define a subject-specific white matter (WM) atlas. Brain parenchyma segmentation returned masks of gray matter (GM) and WM, and normal-appearing WM (NAWM), in addition to the T1 and T2 lesion masks (T1L and T2L, respectively). Ninety-nine relapsing-remitting MS patients (age = 43.3 +/- 9.9 years, disease duration 12.3 +/- 7.7 years) were studied, together with twenty-five healthy controls (HC, age = 38.8 +/- 11.0 years). FWF was higher in GM and NAWM of MS patients, compared to GM and WM of HC (both p < .001). In MS patients, FWF was the highest in the T1L and GM, followed by T2L and NAWM, respectively. FWF increased significantly with T1L and T2L volume (rho ranging from 0.40 to 0.58, p < .001). FWF in T2L was strongly related to both T1L volume and the volume ratio T1L/T2L (rho = 0.73, p < .001). MS patients performed worse than HC in the processing speed test (mean +/- SD: 54.1 +/- 10.3 for MS, 63.8 +/- 10.8 for HC). FWF in GM, T2L, perilesional tissue and NAWM increased with SDMT score reduction (rho = -0.30, -0.29, -0.33 respectively and r = -.30 for T2L, all with p < .005). A regional analysis, conducted to determine which NAWM regions were of particular importance to explain the relationship between FWF and cognitive impairment, revealed that FWF spatial variance was negatively related to SDMT score in the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, WM structures known to be associated with cognitive impairment, in addition to the left corticospinal tract, the sagittal stratum, the right anterior limb of internal capsule. In conclusion, we found excess free water in brain parenchyma of MS patients, an alteration that involved not only MS lesions, but also the GM and NAWM, impinging on brain function and negatively associated with cognitive processing speed. We suggest that the FWF metric, derived from noninvasive, rapid MRI acquisitions and bearing good biological interpretability, may prove valuable as an MRI biomarker of tissue damage and associated cognitive impairment in MS.

N2  -  Objective: To characterize in vivo MRI signatures of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIA and type IIB through combined analysis of morphology, intensity, microstructure, and function.
Methods: We carried out a multimodal 3T MRI profiling of 33 histologically proven FCD type IIA (9) and IIB (24) lesions. A multisurface approach operating on manual consensus labels systematically sampled intracortical and subcortical lesional features. Geodesic distance mapping quantified the same features in the lesion perimeter. Logistic regression assessed the relationship between MRI and histology, while supervised pattern learning was used for individualized subtype prediction.; Results: FCD type IIB was characterized by abnormal morphology, intensity, diffusivity, and function across all surfaces, while type IIA lesions presented only with increased fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal and reduced diffusion anisotropy close to the gray-white matter interface. Similar to lesional patterns, perilesional anomalies were more marked in type IIB extending up to 16 mm. Structural MRI markers correlated with categorical histologic characteristics. A profile-based classifier predicted FCD subtypes with equal sensitivity of 85%, while maintaining a high specificity of 94% against healthy and disease controls.; Conclusions: Image processing applied to widely available MRI contrasts has the ability to dissociate FCD subtypes at a mesoscopic level. Integrating in vivo staging of pathologic traits with automated lesion detection is likely to provide an objective definition of lesional boundary and assist emerging approaches, such as minimally invasive thermal ablation, which do not supply tissue specimen.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The objective was to identify the correspondence between the anterior terminations of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-III) and the intraoperative direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCS)-induced speech arrest area.METHODS The authors retrospectively screened 75 glioma patients (group 1) who received intraoperative DCS mapping in the left dominant frontal cortex. To minimize the influence of tumors or edema, we subsequently selected 26 patients (group 2) with glioma or edema not affecting Broca's area, the ventral precentral gyrus (vPCG), and the subcortical path-ways to generate DCS functional maps and to construct the anterior terminations of AF and SLF-III with tractography. Next, a grid-by-grid pairwise comparison was performed between the fiber terminations and the DCS-induced speech arrest sites to calculate Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) in both groups 1 and 2. Finally, the authors also demonstrated the distribution of the AF/SLF-III anterior projection maps obtained in 192 healthy participants (group 3) and subsequently correlated these with the speech arrest sites in group 2 to examine their validity in predicting speech output area.RESULTS The authors found that speech arrest sites were substantially consistent with SLF-III anterior terminations (group 1, kappa = 0.64 +/- 0.03; group 2, kappa = 0.73 +/- 0.05) and moderately consistent with AF (group 1, kappa = 0.51 +/- 0.03; group 2, kappa = 0.49 +/- 0.05) and AF/SLF-III complex (group 1, kappa = 0.54 +/- 0.03; group 2, kappa = 0.56 +/- 0.05) terminations (all p < 0.0001). The DCS speech arrest sites of the group 2 patients mainly (85.1%) emerged at the anterior bank of the vPCG (vPCGa). In group 3, both terminations of AF and SLF-III converged onto the vPCGa, and their terminations well predicted the DCS speech output area of group 2 (AF, area under the curve [AUC] 86.5%; SLF-III, AUC 79.0%; AF/SLF-III complex, AUC 86.7%).CONCLUSIONS This study supports the key role of the left vPCGa as the speech output node by showing convergence between speech output mapping and anterior AF/SLF-III connectivity in the vPCGa. These findings may contribute to the understanding of speech networks and could have clinical implications in preoperative surgical planning.

N2  -  White matter lesions, typically manifesting as regions of signal intensity abnormality (WMSA) on MRI, increase in frequency with age. However, the role of this damage in cognitive decline and disease is still not clear, as lesion volume has only loosely been associated with clinical status. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to examine the quantitative microstructural integrity of white matter, and has applications in the examination of subtle changes to tissue that appear visually normal on conventional imaging. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether major macrostructural white matter damage, (total WMSA volume), is associated with microstructural integrity of normal appearing white matter, and if these macrostructural changes fully account for microstructural changes. Imaging was performed in 126 nondemented individuals, ages 43-85 years, with no history of cerebrovascular disease. Controlling for age, greater WMSA volume was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in widespread brain regions. Patterns were similar for FA and radial diffusivity but in contrast, WMSA was associated with axial diffusivity in fewer areas. Age was associated with FA in several regions, and many of these effects remained even when controlling for WMSA volume, suggesting the etiology of WMSAs does not fully account for all age-associated white matter deterioration. These results provide evidence that WMSA volume is associated with the integrity of normal-appearing white matter. In addition, our results suggest that overt lesions may not account for the association of increasing age with decreased white matter tissue integrity. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1085-1100, 2014.

N2  -  Despite technological advances in endovascular therapy, surgical clipping of paraclinoid aneurysms remains an indispensable treatment option and has an acceptable profile risk. Intraoperative monitoring of motor and somatosensory evoked potentials has proven to be an effective tool in predicting and preventing postoperative motor deficits during aneurysm clipping. We describe the case of a 61-yr-old Japanese woman with a history of hypertension and smoking. During follow-up for bilateral aneurysms of ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA), left-sided aneurysm growth was detected. A standard pterional approach with extradural clinoidectomy was used to approach the aneurysm. After clipping, a significant intraprocedural change in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude was observed despite native vessel patency was confirmed through micro-Doppler and indocyanine green video angiography. After extensive dissection of the sylvian fissure and exposure of the communicating segment of ICA, the anterior choroidal artery was found to be compressed and occluded by the posterior clinoid because of an inadvertent shift of the ICA after clip application and removal of brain retractors. Posterior clinoidectomy was performed intradurally with microrongeur and MEP amplitude returned readily to baseline values.
Computed tomography (CT) angiogram demonstrated complete exclusion of the aneurysm, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was negative for postoperative ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted images. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0. The patient signed the Institutional Consent Form to undergo the surgical procedure and to allow the use of her images and videos for any type of medical publications.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Surgical treatment of insular tumours carries significant risks of limb paresis or speech disturbances due to their localization. The development of intraoperative neuromonitoring techniques that involve evoked motor potentials induced via both direct and transcranial cortical electrical stimulation as well as direct subcortical white matter stimulation, intraoperative application of preoperative tractography and functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI in conjunction with neuronavigation resulted in significant reduction of postoperative disabilities that enabled widening of indications for surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to present the authors' own experience with surgical treatment of insular gliomas.
Material and methods: Our cohort comprises 30 patients with insular gliomas treated at the Department of Neurosurgery in Sosnowiec. Clinical symptoms included sensorimotor partial seizures in 86.6%; generalized seizures in 23.3%; persistent headaches in 16.6% and hemiparesis in 6.6%. All the patients were operated on with intraoperative neuromonitoring that included transcranial cortical stimulation, direct subcortical white matter stimulation as well as tractography and fMRI concurrently with neuronavigation. The analysis included postoperative neurological evaluation along with the assessment of the radicalism of resection evaluated based on postoperative MRI.; Results: Postoperatively, four patients had permanent hemiparesis (13.3%), importantly, two out of those patients had preoperative deficits (6.6%). Persistent speech disturbances were present in four patients (13.3%). Partial sensorimotor seizures were noted in two patients (6.6%). Seizures in the other patients receded. Intraoperativc transcranial electrical stimulation as well as direct subcortical white matter stimulation along with tractography (DTI) and fMRI facilitated gross total resection of insular gliomas in 53.5%, subtotal in 13.3% and partial resection in 33.1%.; Conclusions: Implementation of TES, direct subcortical white master stimulation, DTI and fMRI into the management protocol of the surgical treatment of insular tumours resulted in total and subtotal resections in 66% of cases with permanent motor disability in 6.6% of patients. Poor prognosis for independent living after surgery mainly affects patients with WHO grade III or IV.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To prospectively determine the feasibility of using diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping before (baseline) and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up to monitor magnetic resonance (MR) image-guided focused ultrasound surgical ablation of uterine fibroids.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was obtained from patients before treatment with our study protocol, as approved by the institutional review board, and the study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Fourteen patients (mean age, 46 years +- 5 standard deviation) who underwent DW imaging were enrolled in this study, and 12 of 14 completed the inclusive MR examination with DW imaging at 6-month follow-up. Treatment was performed by one radiologist with a modified MR image-guided focused ultrasound surgical system coupled with a 1.5-T MR imager. Pre- and posttreatment and 6-month follow-up MR images were obtained by using phase-sensitive T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition, T1-weighted contrast material-enhanced, and DW imaging sequences. Total treatment time was 1-3 hours. Trace ADC maps were constructed for quantitative analysis. Regions of interest localized to areas of hyperintensity on DW images were drawn on postcontrast images, and quantitative statistics were obtained from treated and nontreated uterine tissue before and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance. Differences with P < .05 were considered statistically significant.; RESULTS: T1-weighted contrast-enhancing fibroids selected for treatment had no hyperintense or hypointense signal intensity changes on the DW images or ADC maps before treatment. Considerably increased signal intensity changes that were localized within the treated areas were noted on DW images. Mean baseline ADC value in fibroids was 1504 mm(-6)sec(2) +- 290. Posttreatment ADC values for nontreated fibroid tissue (1685 mm(-6)sec(2) 468) differed from posttreatment ADC values for fibroid tissue (1078 mm(-6) sec(2) +- 293) (P = .001). A significant difference (P < .001) between ADC values for treated (1905 mm(-6)sec(2) +- 446) and nontreated (1437 mm(-6) sec(2) +- 270) fibroid tissue at 6-month follow-up was observed.; CONCLUSION: DW imaging and ADC mapping are feasible for identification of ablated tissue after focused ultrasound treatment of uterine fibroids.

N2  -  A differential analysis framework of longitudinal FLAIR MRI volumes is proposed, based on non-linear gray value mapping, to quantify low-grade glioma growth. First, MRI volumes were mapped to a common range of gray levels via a midway-based histogram mapping. This mapping enabled direct comparison of MRI data and computation of difference maps. A statistical analysis framework of intensity distributions in midway-mapped MRI volumes as well as in their difference maps was designed to identify significant difference values, enabling quantification of low-grade glioma growth, around the borders of an initial segmentation. Two sets of parameters, corresponding to optimistic and pessimistic growth estimations, were proposed. The influence and modeling of MRI inhomogeneity field on a novel midway-mapping framework using image models with multiplicative contrast changes was studied. Clinical evaluation was performed on 32 longitudinal clinical cases from 13 patients. Several growth indices were measured and evaluated in terms of accuracy, compared to manual tracing. Results from the clinical evaluation showed that millimetric precision on a specific volumetric radius growth index measurement can be obtained automatically with the proposed differential analysis. The automated optimistic and pessimistic growth estimates behaved as expected, providing upper and lower bounds around the manual growth estimations. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved by embedding a patient's lesion into an atlas of functional and structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory applicable to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8 years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres). Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual, left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect structural disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in all domains (0.16 < R-2 < 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 < R-2 < 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was scarce or negligible (0.01 < R-2 < 0.18) except for the right visual field deficits (R-2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in a subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information. However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive disorders.

N2  -  Integration of intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (iDWI) into neuronavigation can be potentially useful for identification of the pyramidal tract during surgery for parenchymal brain lesions. The technique of iDWI using an intraoperative MR scanner of low magnetic field strength (0.3 Tesla) has been developed. For image acquisition, a specially designed solenoid radiofrequency receiver coil integrated with a modified Sugita head holder (head-holder coil) was used. While the sensitivity characteristics of the head-holder coil were found to be 29% lower compared to a diagnostic quadrature head coil, they were sufficient to obtain iDWI images of good quality. The relationship between the angle of the motion probe gradient (MPG) pulse to the vertical axis and pyramidal tract contrasting were examined in 4 healthy men with a mean age of 30 +/- 5.7 years. The contrast ratio reached a maximum when the MPG pulse was applied exactly in the anteroposterior direction. The difference of the contrast ratio between right and left sides was not statistically significant. Pyramidal tract visualization became worse and the contrast ratio was reduced when the MPG pulse was applied at different angles to the vertical axis; the reduction rate varied from 20.1 to 27.9% for each 15 degrees of rotation irrespective of its side. In conclusion, the developed scanning Protocol for iDWI using an originally designed head-holder coil allowed effective visualization of the pyramidal tracts using an intraoperative MR scanner of low magnetic field strength.

N2  -  The aim of our study was to investigate the usefulness of high-b-value diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in patients with acute cerebral infarction. DW images at b-values of 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 s/mm(2) were performed for 32 patients 48 h after the onset of stroke using a 1.5 T clinical imager. The area of restricted diffusion became more distinct and extensive with increasing b-value in 19 of 32 patients, especially in patients with the atherothrombotic-type cerebral infarction. The visualized extent of infarction was almost the same among the area of restricted diffusion on the b=3,000 ADC map, b=3,000 DWI and final infarction in 12 of 15 patients. High-b-value DWI provided better identification of lesion extension in the cerebral ischemia. It is suggested that the size of the final infarction or irreversible cytotoxic edema is more predictable on high-b-value DWIs than on the usual b=1,000 DWI.

N2  -  Mapping eloquent brain areas by fMRI only belongs to recent history, but has already proved an essential tool in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with brain lesions. The reasons for this include the fact that fMRI is a non-invasive technique, enabling us to examine patients safely and to repeat the scans several times for follow-up purposes. Other non-invasive techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) are also available for this purpose, but the higher fMRI temporal (as to PET) and spatial (as to MEG) resolution and the wide availability of fMRI functional paradigms make this technique the most suitable way to provide an accurate evaluation of eloquent brain areas. Brain functional mapping has dramatically improved post-surgical neurological sequelae, providing patients with a better quality of life and a longer life expectancy. The accurate definition of functionally eloquent areas allows surgeons to spare as much eloquent tissue as possible and, at the same time, gives them an important cue to adjust the surgical approach pathway. Mere anatomical landmarks are seldom reliable for this purpose, owing to the frequent healthy tissue displacement by the lesion and to the high interpersonal variability. All these advantages, together with the development of 3 T instruments, offering higher spatial definition analysis in a shorter time, have resulted in an increasing diffusion of fMRI and a wide variety of functional MRI paradigms. The aim of this paper is to describe our initial fMRI experience in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with brain lesions and to explain the functional paradigms we used and why.

N2  -  Gliomas are amongst the most common primary brain tumours in adults and are often associated with poor prognosis. Understanding the extent of white matter (WM) which is affected outside the tumoral lesion may be of paramount importance to explain cognitive deficits and the clinical progression of the disease. To this end, we explored both direct (i.e., tractography based) and indirect (i.e., atlas-based) approaches to quantifying WM structural disconnections in a cohort of 44 high- and low-grade glioma patients. While these methodologies have recently gained popularity in the context of stroke and other pathologies, to our knowledge, this is the first time they are applied in patients with brain tumours. More specifically, in this work, we present a quantitative comparison of the disconnection maps provided by the two methodologies by applying well-known metrics of spatial similarity, extension, and correlation. Given the important role the oedematous tissue plays in the physiopathology of tumours, we performed these analyses both by including and excluding it in the definition of the tumoral lesion. This was done to investigate possible differences determined by this choice. We found that direct and indirect approaches offer two distinct pictures of structural disconnections in patients affected by brain gliomas, presenting key differences in several regions of the brain. Following the outcomes of our analysis, we eventually discuss the strengths and pitfalls of these two approaches when applied in this critical field.

N2  -  Microglial cells show a rather uniform distribution of cell numbers throughout the brain with only minor prevalences in some brain regions. Their in situ morphologies, however, may vary markedly from elongated forms observed in apposition with neuronal fibers to spherical cell bodies with sometimes extremely elaborated branching. This heterogeneity gave rise to the: hypothesis that these cells are differentially conditioned by their microenvironment and, therefore, also display specific patterns of differential gene expression. In this study, microglia were isolated from 2-4 week-old mixed CNS cultures that had been prepared from neonatal rat diencephalon, tegmentum, hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and were investigated 24 h later. Messenger RNA levels of proteins involved in crucial immune functions of this cell type (TNF-alpha, CD1, Fc gamma receptor II, and IL-3 receptor beta-subunit) have been determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results clearly show, that three of these mRNAs (TNF-alpha, CD4, Fc gamma receptor II) are differentially expressed in microglia with hippocampal microglia displaying the highest levels of these mRNAs. The data strongly support the notion that the status of microglial gene expression depends on their localization in brain and on specific interactions with other neural cell types. Consequently, it is hypothesized that their responsiveness to signals arising in injury or disease may vary from one brain region to another. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, clinical dMRI suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the consequence of prolonged echo times (TEs) attributable to the limited gradient power in the range of 40-80 mT/m. To overcome this, MRI systems with strong gradients have been designed but so far have mainly been applied in the brain. The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility, data quality, SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of measurements in PCa with a 300 mT/m whole-body system. A cohort of men without and with diagnosed PCa were imaged on a research-only 3T Connectom Siemens MRI system equipped with a gradient amplitude of 300 mT/m. dMRI at high b-values were acquired using high gradient amplitudes and compared with gradient capabilities mimicking clinical systems. Data artefacts typically amplified with stronger gradients were assessed and their correction evaluated. The SNR gains and lesion-to-healthy tissue CNR were statistically tested investigating the effect of protocol and b-value. The diagnostic quality of the images for different dMRI protocols was assessed by an experienced radiologist using a 5-point Likert scale and an adapted PI-QUAL scoring system. The strong gradients for prostate dMRI allowed a significant gain in SNR per unit time compared with clinical gradients. Furthermore, a 1.6-2.1-fold increase in CNR was observed. Despite the more pronounced artefacts typically associated with strong gradients, a satisfactory correction could be achieved. Smoother and less biased parameter maps were obtained with protocols at shorter TEs. The results of this study show that dMRI in PCa with a whole-body 300-mT/m scanner is feasible without a report of physiological effects, SNR and CNR can be improved compared with lower gradient strengths, and artefacts do not negate the benefits of strong gradients and can be ameliorated. This assessment provides the first essential step towards unveiling the full potential of cutting-edge scanners, now increasingly becoming available, to advance early detection and diagnostic precision.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: ADC measurements have been shown to have an inverse relationship with tumor cell density. DCE-MR imaging modeling techniques can produce a measurement of the v(e), which would also be expected to have an inverse relationship with cell density. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that areas of increased cellularity, and therefore low ADC, would be expected to have a small EES (low v(e)).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with GBM were recruited. All imaging was performed before surgery on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Imaging included diffusion tensor imaging, T1-weighted DCE-MR imaging, and anatomic sequences. Tumor VOIs were defined on the anatomic images and modified to contain only enhancing voxels. Parametric maps of ADC and v(e) were generated. Statistical analysis of ADC and v(e) was performed on both a voxel-by-voxel basis and comparison of median values.; RESULTS: No correlation was demonstrated between ADC and v(e) in either a voxel-by-voxel analysis or comparison of median values (P = .124).; CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate a correlation between ADC and v(e). This is important because it suggests that though the mechanisms underlying these parameters are theoretically similar, they actually reflect different aspects of tumor microenvironment. Consequently ADC and v(e) should be considered to provide independent information about the properties of the EES.

N2  -  We present a method for registering histology and in vivo imaging that requires minimal microtoming and is automatic following the user's initialization. In this demonstration, we. register a single hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histological slide of a coronal section of a rat brain harboring a 9L gliosarcoma with an in vivo 7T MR image volume of the same brain. Because the spatial resolution of the in vivo MRI is limited, we add the step of obtaining a high spatial resolution, ex vivo MRI in situ for intermediate registration. The approach taken was to maximize mutual information in order to optimize the registration between all pairings of image data whether the sources are MRI, tissue block photograph, or stained sample photograph. The warping interpolant used was thin plate splines with the appropriate basis function for either 2-D or 3-D applications. All registrations were implemented by user initialization of the approximate pose between the two data sets, followed by automatic optimization based on maximizing mutual information. Only the higher quality anatomical images were used in the registration process; however, the spatial transformation was directly applied to a quantitative diffusion image. Quantitative diffusion maps from the registered location appeared highly correlated with the H&E slide. Overall, this approach provides a robust method for coregistration of in vivo images with histological sections and will have broad applications in the field of functional and molecular imaging.

N2  -  Alexia and agraphia are disorders common to the left inferior parietal lobule, including the angular and supramarginal gyri. However, it is still unclear how these cortical regions interact with other cortical sites and what the most important white matter tracts are in relation to reading and writing processes.
Here, the authors present the case of a patient who underwent an awake craniotomy for a left inferior parietal lobule glioma using direct cortical and subcortical electrostimulation. The use of subcortical stimulation allowed identification of the specific white matter tracts associated with reading and writing. These tracts were found as portions of the dorsal inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) fibers in the deep parietal lobe that are responsible for connecting the frontal lobe to the superior parietal lobule. These findings are consistent with previous diffusion tensor imaging tractography and functional MRI studies, which suggest that the IFOF may play a role in the reading and writing processes. This is the first report of transient alexia and agraphia elicited through intraoperative direct subcortical electrostimulation, and the findings support the crucial role of the IFOF in reading and writing.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate whether the percentage of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes could be used as an imaging marker related to tumor cell apoptotic and Ki-67 proliferation index of tumors.
Materials and Methods: Mice bearing CT26 colorectal carcinoma tumors were scanned before radiotherapy, then divided into radiotherapy (n = 24) and control groups (n = 24). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and anatomic T2WI were performed on six randomly chosen mice in total from two groups at different timepoints after radiotherapy (4, 8, 12 hours, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 days). After imaging, six animals were sacrificed at each timepoint and histological analyses were undertaken. ADC maps were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using built-in software (Functool, GE). Regions of interest were manually circumscribed for all high-signal areas on lesions observed during DWI. The percentage of ADC changes were calculated at predefined timepoints and compared with the apoptotic and proliferation index from the histological analyses by using the Pearson correlation test.; Results: A significant positive correlation was found between the percentage of ADC changes of the viable tissue and apoptotic index. A significant negative correlation was found between the percentage of ADC changes of the viable tissue and Ki-67 proliferation index.; Conclusion: Our results suggest that the percentage of ADC changes can be used as a measurement of cell apoptotic and proliferation index in colorectal carcinoma.

N2  -  Myelin is the protective sheath wrapped around axons, consisting of a phospholipid bilayer with water between the wraps. The measurement of damage to the myelin sheaths, the evaluation of the efficacy of therapies aiming to promote remyelination and monitoring the degree of brain maturation in children all require non-invasive quantitative myelin imaging methods. To date, various myelin imaging techniques have been developed. Five different MRI approaches can be distinguished based on their biophysical principles: (i) imaging of the water between the lipid bilayers directly (e.g. myelin water imaging); (ii) imaging the non-aqueous protons of the phospholipid bilayer directly with ultra-short echo-time techniques; (iii) indirect imaging of the macromolecular content (e.g. magnetization transfer; inhomogeneous magnetization transfer); (iv) mapping of the effects of the myelin sheath's magnetic susceptibility on the MRI signal (e.g. quantitative susceptibility mapping) and (v) mapping of the effects of the myelin sheath on water diffusion. Myelin imaging with PET uses radioactive molecules with high affinity to specific myelin components, in particular myelin basic protein. This review aims to give an overview of the various myelin imaging techniques, their biophysical principles, image acquisition, data analysis and their validation status.
van der Weijden et al. review myelin imaging techniques and discuss their differences on a biophysical level. They conclude that the most promising techniques are quantitative susceptibility mapping and inhomogeneous magnetization transfer for MRI, and C-11-MeDAS for PET.

N2  -  High-intensity focused ultrasound can ablate a target permanently, leaving tissues through which it passes thermally unaffected. When delivered under magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance, the change in tissue relaxivity on heating is used to monitor the temperatures achieved. Different tissue types in the pre-focal beam path result in energy loss defined by their individual attenuation coefficients. Furthermore, at interfaces with different acoustic impedances the beam will be both reflected and refracted, changing the position of the focus. For complex interfaces this effect is exacerbated. Moreover, blood vessels proximal to the focal region can dissipate heat, altering the expected region of damage. In the target volume, the temperature distribution depends on the thermal conductivity (or diffusivity) of the tissue and its heat capacity. These are different for vascular tissues, water and fat containing tissues and bone. Therefore, documenting the characteristics of the pre-focal and target tissues is critical for effective delivery of HIFU. MR imaging provides excellent anatomic detail and characterization of soft tissue components. It is an ideal modality for real-time planning and monitoring of HIFU ablation, and provides non-invasive temperature maps. Clinical applications involve soft-tissue (abdomino-pelvic applications) or bone (brain applications) pre-focally and at the target (soft-tissue tumors and bone metastases respectively). This article addresses the technical difficulties of delivering HIFU effectively when vascular tissues, densely cellular tissues, fat or bone are traversed pre-focally, and the clinical applications that target these tissues. The strengths and limitations of MR techniques used for monitoring ablation in these tissues are also discussed.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the utility of voxelwise analysis in the detection of lesions in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of individual multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 10 normal controls and six patients with NIS lesions. The fractional anisotropy (FA) maps derived from the diffusion-weighted images were then spatially normalized (via an affine transformation) into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and the normalized FA map of each of the patients was compared voxelwise With the normalized FA maps of the group of normals in a one-sample t-test (P = 0.0001). Two independent board-certified neuroradiologists reviewed the data.; Results: In the patient data for all six cases, the two reviewers determined detection sensitivities of 72% and 96% for the voxelwise technique based on known fluidattenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) lesions. In addition, between the two reviewers, nine NAWM regions exhibiting FA reductions were identified in the six patients. However, numerous regions of abnormal FA were detected that were attributed to poor intersubject image registration.; Conclusion: Voxelwise analysis of spatially normalized FA maps has the potential to identify regions of FA reduction in lesions and in the NAWM of individual MS patients in a rapid and reproducible fashion.

Here, we are reporting a rare case of completely cystic brain stem epidermoid in a child. The patient presented with clinical features of brain stem involvement. MRI brain was suggestive of cystic brain stem lesion.; Patient went through surgical procedure. Final diagnosis of epidermoid cyst was confirmed on histopathological report.; With the help of various advanced sequences of MRI like diffusion and ADC, diagnosis of epidermoid cyst can be established at unusual intracranial site also. Surgical resection of epidermoid cyst at brain stem should be attempted judiciously utilizing all modern tools of neurosurgery.

N2  -  Background: The pathogenetic mechanisms sustaining neuroinflammatory disorders may originate from the cerebrospinal fluid. Objective: To evaluate white matter damage with diffusion tensor imaging and T1/T2-weighted ratio at progressive distances from the ventricular system in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and multiple sclerosis. Methods: Fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity and T1/T2-weighted ratio maps were obtained from patients with seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, and healthy controls (n = 20 each group). White matter damage was assessed as function of ventricular distance within progressive concentric bands. Results: Compared to healthy controls, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders patients had similar fractional anisotropy, radial and axial diffusivity, increased mean diffusivity (p = 0.009-0.013) and reduced T1/T2-weighted ratio (p = 0.024-0.037) in all bands. In multiple sclerosis, gradient of percentage lesion volume and intra-lesional mean and axial diffusivity were higher in periventricular bands. Compared to healthy controls, multiple sclerosis patients had reduced fractional anisotropy (p = 0.001-0.043) in periventricular bands, increased mean (p < 0.001), radial (p < 0.001-0.004), and axial diffusivity (p = 0.002-0.008) and preserved T1/T2-weighted ratio in all bands. Conclusion: White matter damage is higher at periventricular level in multiple sclerosis and diffuse in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Fractional anisotropy preservation, associated with increased mean diffusivity and reduced T1/T2-weighted ratio may reflect astrocyte damage.

N2  -  Imaging of the cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and their connectivity are gaining attraction, due to the important role the cerebellum plays in cognition and motor control. Atlases of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei are used to locate regions of interest in clinical and neuroscience studies. However, the white matter that connects these relay stations is of at least similar functional importance. Damage to these cerebellar white matter tracts may lead to serious language, cognitive and emotional disturbances, although the pathophysiological mechanism behind it is still debated. Differences in white matter integrity between patients and controls might shed light on structure-function correlations. A probabilistic parcellation atlas of the cerebellar white matter would help these studies by facilitating automatic segmentation of the cerebellar peduncles, the localization of lesions and the comparison of white matter integrity between patients and controls.
In this work a digital three-dimensional probabilistic atlas of the cerebellar white matter is presented, based on high quality 3 T, 1.25 mm resolution diffusion MRI data from 90 subjects participating in the Human Connectome Project. The white matter tracts were estimated using probabilistic tractography. Results over 90 subjects were symmetrical and trajectories of superior, middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles resembled the anatomy as known from anatomical studies.; This atlas will contribute to a better understanding of cerebellar white matter architecture. It may eventually aid in defining structure-function correlations in patients with cerebellar disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  We present an extremely rare case of the atypical choroid plexus papilloma in an adult which developed at the trigone of right lateral ventricle. A 62-year-old woman presented with the history of intermittent and gradually progressive headache and left side hemiparesis for 6 months. The brain magnetic resonance image showed highly enhanced and well demarcated mass at the trigone of lateral ventricle attached to the choroid plexus. Gross total resection was performed by transcortical approach via the middle temporal gyrus. The tumor was diagnosed as an atypical choroid plexus papilloma. She had no neurologic deficit after the surgery. We report a case of atypical choroid plexus papilloma in adult and introduce newly classified pathologic characteristics of this tumor.

T2  -  NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW

N2  -  Due to medical advances, a large portion of children survive brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it is important to identify the neuroanatomical and neurocognitive outcomes associated with survivorship. This review summarizes the specific regional structural neuroimaging findings, the broad structural findings, as well as the corresponding neurocognitive domains affected in brain tumor populations. Across studies, damage is commonly reported near the cerebellum, brain stem, and subcortical regions, as well as the frontal lobes. These results are consistent with the expected neuroanatomical damage following posterior fossa brain tumors, which was the most common tumor location of the studies in this review. Damage to these regions impacts a broad range of neurocognitive outcomes, as well as a number of specific neurocognitive domains. Damage to more ventral and subcortical brain regions correlated with lower motor speed, processing speed, attention, and memory. Relevant limitations and future directions are discussed with a focus on disentangling the complex and multifaceted factors associated with the consequences of brain tumor survivorship.

N2  -  Purpose Previous studies have shown that diffusion of water through intrinsic susceptibility gradients produces a dispersion of the spin-lattice relaxation rate in the rotating frame (R-1(rho)) over a low range of spin-locking amplitudes (0 < omega(1) < 100 Hz), whereas at higher omega(1) and high magnetic fields, a second dispersion arises due to chemical exchange. Here, we separated these different effects and evaluated their contributions in tumors. Methods Maps of R-1(rho) and its changes with locking field were acquired on intracranial 9-L tumor models. The R-1(rho) changes due to diffusion (R1 rho Diff) were calculated by subtracting maps of R-1(rho) at 100 Hz (R-1(rho)[100 Hz]) from those at 0 Hz (R-1(rho)[0 Hz]). The R-1(rho) changes due to exchange (R1 rho Ex) were calculated by subtracting maps of R-1(rho) at 5620 Hz (R-1(rho)[5620 Hz]) from those of R-1(rho) at 100 Hz (R-1(rho)[100 Hz]). Measurements of vascular dimensions and spacing were performed ex vivo using 3D confocal microscopy. Results The R-1(rho) changes at low omega(1) in tumors (5.24 +/- 1.78 s(-1)) are substantially (p = 3.7(6)) greater than those in normal tissues (1.36 +/- 0.70 s(-1)), which we suggest are due to greater contributions from diffusion through susceptibility gradients. Tumor vessels were larger and spaced less closely compared with normal brain, which may be 1 factor contributing the susceptibility within 9-L tumors. The contrast between tumor and normal tissues for R1 rho Diff is larger than for R1 rho Ex and for the apparent R-2w. Conclusion Images that are sensitive to the variations of spin-lock relaxation rates at low omega(1) provide a novel form of contrast that reflects the heterogeneous nature of intrinsic variations within tumors.

N2  -  Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has a variety of biological actions that suggest efficacy as a neuroprotectant. We (1) tested the neuroprotective potential of DMSO at different time windows on infarct size using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining and (2) investigated the effects of DMSO on ischemia evolution using quantitative diffusion and perfusion imaging in a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. In experiment 1, DMSO treatment (1.5 g/kg intravenously over 3 h) reduced infarct volume 24 h after MCAO by 65% (P<0.00001) when initiated 20 h before MCAO, by 44% (P=0.0006) when initiated 1 h after MCAO, and by 17% (P=0.11) when started 2 h after MCAO. Significant infarct reduction was also observed after a 3-day survival in animals treated 1 h after MCAO (P=0.005). In experiment 2, treatment was initiated 1 h after MCAO and maps for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were acquired before treatment and then every 30 mins up to 4 h. Cerebral blood flow characteristics and CBF-derived lesion volumes did not differ between treated and untreated animals, whereas the ADC-derived lesion volume essentially stopped progressing during DMSO treatment, resulting in a persistent diffusion/perfusion mismatch. This effect was mainly observed in the cortex. Our data suggest that DMSO represents an interesting candidate for acute stroke treatment.

N2  -  Background Brain-to-brain evoked potentials constitute a new methodology that could help to understand the network-level correlates of electrical stimulation applied for brain mapping during tumor resection. In this paper, we aimed to describe the characteristics of axono-cortical evoked potentials recorded from distinct, but in the same patient, behaviorally eloquent white matter sites.
Methods We report the intraoperative white matter mapping and axono-cortical evoked potentials recordings observed in a patient operated on under awake condition of a diffuse low-grade glioma in the left middle frontal gyrus. Out of the eight behaviorally eloquent sites identified with 60-Hz electrical stimulation, five were probed with single electrical pulses (delivered at 1 Hz), while recording evoked potentials on two electrodes, covering the inferior frontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus, respectively. Postoperative diffusion-weighted MRI was used to reconstruct the tractograms passing through each of the five stimulated sites.; Results Each stimulated site generated an ACEP on at least one of the recorded electrode contacts. The whole pattern-i.e., the specific contacts with ACEPs and their waveform-was distinct for each of the five stimulated sites.; Conclusions We found that the patterns of ACEPs provided unique electrophysiological signatures for each of the five white matter functional sites. Our results could ultimately provide neurosurgeons with a new tool of intraoperative electrophysiologically based functional guidance.

N2  -  MRI-based tractography is still underexploited and unsuited for routine use in brain tumor surgery due to heterogeneity of methods and functional-anatomical definitions and above all, the lack of a turn-key system. Standardization of methods is therefore desirable, whereby an objective and reliable approach is a prerequisite before the results of any automated procedure can subsequently be validated and used in neurosurgical practice. In this work, we evaluated these preliminary but necessary steps in healthy volunteers. Specifically, we evaluated the robustness and reliability (i.e., test-retest reproducibility) of tractography results of six clinically relevant white matter tracts by using healthy volunteer data (N = 136) from the Human Connectome Project consortium. A deep learning convolutional network-based approach was used for individualized segmentation of regions of interest, combined with an evidence-based tractography protocol and appropriate post-tractography filtering. Robustness was evaluated by estimating the consistency of tractography probability maps, i.e., averaged tractograms in normalized space, through the use of a hold-out cross-validation approach. No major outliers were found, indicating a high robustness of the tractography results. Reliability was evaluated at the individual level. First by examining the overlap of tractograms that resulted from repeatedly processed identical MRI scans (N = 10, 10 iterations) to establish an upper limit of reliability of the pipeline. Second, by examining the overlap for subjects that were scanned twice at different time points (N = 40). Both analyses indicated high reliability, with the second analysis showing a reliability near the upper limit. The robust and reliable subject-specific generation of white matter tracts in healthy subjects holds promise for future validation of our pipeline in a clinical population and subsequent implementation in brain tumor surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neurosurgical resection is one of the few opportunities researchers have to image the human brain pre- and postfocal damage. A major challenge associated with brains undergoing surgical resection is that they often do not fit brain templates most image-processing methodologies are based on. Manual intervention is required to reconcile the pathology, requiring time investment and introducing reproducibility concerns, and extreme cases must be excluded.
METHODS We propose an automatic longitudinal pipeline based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging acquisitions to facilitate a Pathway Lesion Symptom Mapping analysis relating focal white matter injury to functional deficits. This two-part approach includes (i) automatic segmentation of focal white matter injury from anisotropic power differences, and (ii) modeling disconnection using tractography on the single-subject level, which specifically identifies the disconnections associated with focal white matter damage.; RESULTS The advantages of this approach stem from (1) objective and automatic lesion segmentation and tractogram generation, (2) objective and precise segmentation of affected tissue likely to be associated with damage to long-range white matter pathways (defined by anisotropic power), (3) good performance even in the cases of anatomical distortions by use of nonlinear tensor-based registration, which aligns images using an approach sensitive to white matter microstructure.; CONCLUSIONS Mapping a system as variable and complex as the human brain requires sample sizes much larger than the current technology can support. This pipeline can be used to execute large-scale, sufficiently powered analyses by meeting the need for an automatic approach to objectively quantify white matter disconnection.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Advanced imaging analysis for the prediction of tumor biology and modelling of clinically relevant parameters using computed imaging features is part of the emerging field of radiomics research. Here we test the hypothesis that a machine learning approach can distinguish grade 1 from higher gradings in meningioma patients using radiomics features derived from a heterogenous multicenter dataset of multi-paramedic MRI.
Methods: A total of 138 patients from 5 international centers that underwent MRI prior to surgical resection of intracranial meningiomas were included. Segmentation was performed manually on co-registered multi-parametric MR images using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1c), subtraction maps (Sub, T1c - T1), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted (T2) images. Feature selection was performed and using cross-validation to separate training from testing data, four machine learning classifiers were scored on combinations of MRI modalities: random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP).; Results: The best AUC of 0.97 (1.0 and 0.97 for sensitivity and specificity) was observed for the combination of ADC, ADC of the peritumoral edema, T1, T1c, Sub and FLAIR-derived features using only 16 of the 10,914 possible features and XGBoost.; Conclusions: Machine learning using radiomics features derived from multi-parametric MRI is capable of high AUC scores with high sensitivity and specificity in classifying meningiomas between low and higher gradings despite heterogeneous protocols across different centers. Feature selection can be performed effectively even when extracting a large amount of data for radiomics fingerprinting.

N2  -  Iodine-123-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP has been reported to be an excellent tracer for mapping cerebral blood flow with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Clinical interpretation of these SPECT images, however, requires further understanding of the kinetics of IMP in the human brain. In order to evaluate the kinetic behavior of IMP in normal and diseased areas, we measured flow and back-diffusion rates with serial dynamic SPECT scans following an intravenous bolus injection of IMP using a multi-detector SPECT scanner. Arterial input function was determined by octanol extracted radioactivity of serial arterial blood samples. Average values for influx rate (K1) and back-diffusion rate (k2) were 0.43 ml/g/min and 0.014 min 1 in the normal cerebral cortex, 0.43 and 0.013 in the basal ganglia, 0.28 and 0.012 in the white matter and 0.48 and 0.016 in the cerebellar hemisphere. The partition coefficient (K1/k2 ratio) was 32.4 ml/g in the cerebral cortex, 35.3 in the basal ganglia, 24.7 in the white matter and 30.4 in the cerebellum. The K1-to-k2 ratio in the infarcted and ischemic regions as well as in the tumor was smaller than that of the normal cortex. Accurate measurement of local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) based on the microsphere model was possible only on the early SPECT images, but a relative pattern of LCBF can be assessed with SPECT images obtained within 1 hr after injection except for tumors.

N2  -  Background Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of axonal degeneration, have previously been reported to be raised in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated microglia, an intrinsic inflammatory response to brain lesions, are also known to be present in a majority of Alzheimer or mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects with raised beta-amyloid load on their positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. It is now considered that the earliest phase of inflammation may be protective to the brain, removing amyloid plaques and remodelling synapses. Our aim was to determine whether the cortical inflammation/microglial activation load, measured with the translocator protein marker C-11-PK11195 PET, was correlated with plasma NfL levels in prodromal and early Alzheimer subjects. Methods Twenty-seven MCI or early AD cases with raised cortical beta-amyloid load had C-11-(R)-PK11195 PET, structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and levels of their plasma NfL measured. Correlation analyses were performed using surface-based cortical statistics. Results Statistical maps localised areas in MCI cases where levels of brain inflammation correlated inversely with plasma NfL levels. These areas were localised in the frontal, parietal, precuneus, occipital, and sensorimotor cortices. Brain inflammation correlated negatively with mean diffusivity (MD) of water with regions overlapping. Conclusion We conclude that an inverse correlation between levels of inflammation in cortical areas and plasma NfL levels indicates that microglial activation may initially be protective to axons in AD. This is supported by the finding of an inverse association between cortical water diffusivity and microglial activation in the same regions. Our findings suggest a rationale for stimulating microglial activity in early and prodromal Alzheimer cases-possibly using immunotherapy. Plasma NfL levels could be used as a measure of the protective efficacy of immune stimulation and for monitoring efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents.

N2  -  Although brain tumours are rare compared with other malignancies, they are responsible, in many cases, for severe physical and cognitive disability and have a high case fatality rate (13% overall survival at 5 years). Gliomas account for over 60% of primary brain tumours and usually present with one or more symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, progressive neurological deficit, seizures, focal or global cognitive decline. The diagnosis is made by a combination of imaging and histological examination of tumour specimen. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the gold standard imaging modality and provides highly sensitive anatomical information about the tumour. Advanced imaging modalities provide complementary information about brain tumour metabolism, blood flow and ultrastructure and are being increasingly incorporated into routine clinical sequences. Imaging is essential for guiding surgery and radiotherapy treatments and for monitoring response to, and progression of, therapy. However, changes in imaging over time may be misinterpreted and lead to incorrect assumptions about the effectiveness of treatments. Thus, the disappearance of contrast enhancement and resolution of oedema after anti-angiogenesis treatments is seen early while conventional T-2 weighted/FLAIR sequences demonstrate continual tumour growth (pseudoregression). Conversely imaging may suggest lack of efficacy of treatment e. g. increasing tumour size and contrast enhancement following chemoradiation for malignant gliomas (pseudoprogression), which then stabilise or resolve after a few months of continued treatment and that paradoxically may be associated with a better outcome. These factors have led to a re-evaluation of the role of standard sequences in the assessment of treatment response spurning interest in the development of quantitative biomarkers.

N2  -  Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of diffusion and perfusion quantitative MR parameters, on patients with malignant soft tissue tumors. In addition, we investigated the spatial agreement of hallmarks of malignancy as indicated by diffusion and perfusion biomarkers respectively.
Methods: Nonlinear least squares were used for the quantification of the DWI and DCE derived parameters for 25 patients of histologically proven soft tissue sarcoma scanned at a 1.5 T scanner. 4D data were analyzed by an in house built software implemented in Python 3.5 resulting in voxel based parametric maps based on the IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM), Extended Toft's (ETM) and Gamma Capillary Transit time (GCTT) models. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was also used for assessing the accuracy of the DCE fitting models.; Results: A good Pearson's correlation (r > 0.5) was found between micro-perfusion fraction (f-IVIM) and plasma volume (vp-GCTT). There was no significant correlation between all other possible pairs of DCE and DWI derived parameters. Following thresholding the indicators of malignancy from both imaging methods, the percentage of volume overlap between regions of high cellularity and high vascular permeability ranged from 6% to 30%.; Conclusion: A free correlation study among all DCE and DWI derived pairs of parameters, showed a linear relationship between f-IVIM and vp-GCTT in patients with soft tissue sarcomas. DCE in conjunction with DWI MRI can provide useful information on sites of aggressive characteristics for guiding the pre-operative biopsy and for overall treatment planning.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiangiogenic therapies, such as bevacizumab, decrease contrast enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity in patients with high-grade gliomas in a manner that may not correlate with actual tumor response. This study evaluated the ability of an advanced DWI technique, restriction spectrum imaging, to improve conspicuity within regions of restricted diffusion compared with ADC in patients treated with bevacizumab and to demonstrate that unlike ADC, restriction spectrum imaging is less affected by bevacizumab-induced reductions in FLAIR hyperintensity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps and DWI were available for 12 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas at baseline and following initiation of bevacizumab. VOIs were drawn for regions of restricted diffusion, surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity, and normal-appearing white matter; and intensity values within regions of restricted diffusion and FLAIR hyperintensity were normalized to normal-appearing white matter. Normalized values were compared between restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps and ADC at baseline and on treatment by using repeated-measures ANOVA.; RESULTS: All patients exhibited decreases in contrast enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity following treatment. Normalized intensity values were higher on restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps compared with ADC in regions of restricted diffusion, whereas intensity values were higher on ADC compared with restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps in regions of FLAIR hyperintensity. Bevacizumab-induced decreases in FLAIR hyperintensity had a greater effect on ADC than on the restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps, with the relative sensitivity of ADC to changes in FLAIR hyperintensity being >20 times higher than that on restriction spectrum imaging cellularity maps.; CONCLUSIONS: Restriction spectrum imaging is less influenced by reductions in FLAIR hyperintensity compared with ADC, which may confer an advantage of restriction spectrum imaging over ADC for interpreting tumor response on imaging following antiangiogenic therapy.

N2  -  Background: The intention of this study was the prospective analysis of Wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract after paramedian pons infarction. Methods: Patients with paramedian pons infarct underwent MR imaging including diffusion tensor imaging at admission and got 1-3 MR scans up to 6 months of follow-up. Clinical scores and transcranial magnetic stimulation were acquired in the acute phase and 3-6 months later. The pyramidal tracts were manually segmented in fractional anisotropy (FA) color maps after coregistration of all MR datasets of each patient. FA as well as axial and radial diffusivity were measured in the volume of lesioned and contralateral pyramidal tracts distally to the ischemic lesion. Results: From 11 patients studied, 7 developed Wallerian degeneration detected as statistically significant decrease in FA over time in the distal pyramidal tract. Wallerian degeneration could be detected at the earliest between the first and the third days after the onset of symptoms. A continuous decrease in FA and an increase in axial and radial diffusivity in degenerating pyramidal tracts over time were demonstrated. A significant correlation between NIHSS score on admission and the slope of relative axial diffusivity and a significant correlation between motor-evoked potential amplitudes of the arm on admission and the outcome relative FA was found. Conclusions: The initial MR image cannot predict the following Wallerian degeneration. However, the severity of motor disturbance and the motor-evoked potential of the arm on admission could be possible parameters to predict Wallerian degeneration. For estimation of Wallerian degeneration over time, at least 2 diffusion tensor imaging measurements have to be done at different time points. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  Backgrounds: This study aimed to investigate the possible asymmetric distribution of acute ischemic infarct lesions between patients with right-sided stroke versus left-sided stroke. Methods: Acute ischemic stroke patients with unilateral infarct who underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan within 24 hours of onset were included. Infarct lesions were segmented on diffusion-weighted-imaging series and coregistered on the MNI-152 brain map. After flipping all lesions to the left side, voxel-based analysis was performed to evaluate for asymmetric distribution of infarct lesions using the stroke side as an independent variable. Symptom severity at admission was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and early clinical outcome with the modified Rankin Scale score at discharge. Results: Of the 218 patients included in this study, 110 had right-sided ischemic infarcts whereas 108 had left-sided ischemic infarcts. There was no significant difference between patients with right-sided stroke versus left-sided stroke in terms of admission symptom severity, rate of treatment, stroke risk factors, and early clinical outcome. However, voxel-based analysis showed that ischemic infarcts of insular ribbon and lentiform nucleus were asymmetrically more common on the left-sided stroke compared to the right-sided stroke. The admission symptoms were more severe among patients with left insular ribbon and lentiform nucleus infarct compared to those with infarction of mirrored right anatomical regions (P = .019). Conclusions: Acute ischemic infarcts of the left insular ribbon and lentiform nucleus are asymmetrically more common compared to mirrored counterpart regions, presumably due to more severe symptoms at presentation. Otherwise, distribution of symptomatic infarcts to the rest of the brain is roughly symmetric.

N2  -  Background For patients with brain tumors, maximizing the extent of resection while minimizing postoperative neurological morbidity requires accurate preoperative identification of eloquent structures. Recent studies have provided evidence that anatomy may not always predict eloquence. In this study, we directly compare transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) data combined with tractography to traditional anatomic grading criteria for predicting permanent deficits in patients with motor eloquent gliomas. Methods We selected a cohort of 42 glioma patients with perirolandic tumors who underwent preoperative TMS mapping with subsequent resection and intraoperative mapping. We collected clinical outcome data from their chart with the primary outcome being new or worsened motor deficit present at 3 month follow up, termed "permanent deficit". We overlayed the postoperative resection cavity onto the preoperative MRI containing preoperative imaging features. Results Almost half of the patients showed TMS positive points significantly displaced from the precentral gyrus, indicating tumor induced neuroplasticity. In multivariate regression, resection of TMS points was significantly predictive of permanent deficits while the resection of the precentral gyrus was not. TMS tractography showed significantly greater predictive value for permanent deficits compared to anatomic tractography, regardless of the fractional anisotropic (FA) threshold. For the best performing FA threshold of each modality, TMS tractography provided both higher positive and negative predictive value for identifying true nonresectable, eloquent cortical and subcortical structures. Conclusion TMS has emerged as a preoperative mapping modality capable of capturing tumor induced plastic reorganization, challenging traditional presurgical imaging modalities.

N2  -  Carmustine wafers can be implanted in the surgical bed of high-grade gliomas, which can induce surgical bed cyst formation, leading to clinically relevant mass effect. An observational retrospective monocentric study was conducted including 122 consecutive adult patients with a newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma who underwent a surgical resection with Carmustine wafer implantation as first line treatment (2005-2018). Twenty-two patients (18.0%) developed a postoperative contrast-enhancing cyst within the surgical bed: 16 surgical bed cysts and six bacterial abscesses. All patients with a surgical bed cyst were managed conservatively, all resolved on imaging follow-up, and no patient stopped the radiochemotherapy. Independent risk factors of formation of a postoperative surgical bed cyst were age >= 60 years (p = 0.019), number of Carmustine wafers implanted >= 8 (p = 0.040), and partial resection (p = 0.025). Compared to surgical bed cysts, the occurrence of a postoperative bacterial abscess requiring surgical management was associated more frequently with a shorter time to diagnosis from surgery (p = 0.009), new neurological deficit (p < 0.001), fever (p < 0.001), residual air in the cyst (p = 0.018), a cyst diameter greater than that of the initial tumor (p = 0.027), and increased mass effect and brain edema compared to early postoperative MRI (p = 0.024). Contrast enhancement (p = 0.473) and diffusion signal abnormalities (p = 0.471) did not differ between postoperative bacterial abscesses and surgical bed cysts. Clinical and imaging findings help discriminate between surgical bed cysts and bacterial abscesses following Carmustine wafer implantation. Surgical bed cysts can be managed conservatively. Individual risk factors will help tailor their steroid therapy and imaging follow-up.

N2  -  Strategic cortical lesions involving the hand motor cortex (HMC) presenting acutely as distal upper limb pure motor weakness certainly do need to be differentiated on clinical grounds from "pseudoperipheral palsy." This rare phenotype can imitate peripheral motor nerve deficits and should not be easily overlooked. The? isolated "central hand and finger weakness" presenting as an acute onset of varying combinations such as pseudomedian, pseudoradial, and/or pseudoulnar nerve palsy is intriguing to the novice. In literature, this phenotype has been reported solely to result from cortical cerebral infarction and documented to occur in <1% of all ischemic strokes. The apropos of six "unforgettable patients" here highlights the heterogeneous pathophysiologic etiologies and mechanisms that included not only the conventional stroke risk factors but also hyperhomocysteinemia, common carotid artery thrombosis due to hyperhomocysteinemia and severe iron-deficiency anemia, biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis (GCA), cerebral metastasis, and dilated cardiomyopathy-related left ventricular thrombosis. Physicians and neurologists alike, as clinicians, need to be familiar with the peculiarities and clinical presentations of central hand control network cortical lesions.

N2  -  Purpose: Determine whether white matter signal fluctuation on T2* weighted BOLD contrast images are associated with aging and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD).
Methodology: Resting state BOLD data were collected with a 250 ms repetition time (TR) to achieve unaliased, ungated cardiac sampled BOLD (cs-BOLD) images on 11 young adult controls, 10 healthy older adult controls and 7 adults with extensive white matter hyperintensities (WMH) from SVD. Tissue classes (WM and GM) were segmented on T1 images. WMH were identified on FLAIR images in the SVD group. Raw physiological noise (sigma(physio)) and cardiac pulsatility (i.e. fluctuations at the cardiac frequency) were calculated voxel wise and group differences were tested by ANOVA. It was also possible to calculate sigma(physio) in 2s TR cardiac aliased whole-brain BOLD (wb-BOLD) data (N = 84) obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping.; Results: CS-BOLD metrics showed an aging and SVD effects (p<0.0005). Covariates such as thermal noise, WM volume and partial volume did not influence the significant aging effect seen on the cardiac pulsatility metric (p<0.017) but did influence the sigma(physio) (p = 0.184). As a verification of the cs-BOLD findings, the wb-BOLD also showed a linear aging effect of sigma(physio) in WM. In the SVD adults, cardiac pulsatility and sigma(physio) were lower in WMH regions compared to normal appearing white matter (NAWM) regions (p<0.0013 and p<0.002, respectively). Cardiac pulsatility was better able to distinguish WMH regions from NAWM than sigma(physio) as measured by effect size (Cohen's d 2.2 and 0.88, respectively).; Conclusion: NAWM was found to have graded increases in cardiac pulsations due to age and SVD, independently. Within SVD participants, WMH lesions had reduced physiological noise compared to NAWM. Cardiac pulsatility in resting BOLD data may provide a complementary dynamic measure of WM integrity to add to static FLAIR anatomical images.

N2  -  The major goal of the evaluation in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis for medically intractable patients is the precise reconstruction of the epileptogenic foci, preferably with non-invasive methods. This paper evaluates whether surface electroencephalography (EEG) source analysis based on a 1 mm anisotropic finite element (FE) head model can provide additional guidance for presurgical epilepsy diagnosis and whether it is practically feasible in daily routine. A 1 mm hexahedra FE volume conductor model of the patient's head with special focus on accurately modeling the compartments skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the anisotropic conducting brain tissues was constructed using non-linearly co-registered T1-, T2- and diffusion-tensormagnetic resonance imaging data. The electrodes of intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) measurements were extracted from a co-registered computed tomography image. Goal function scan (GFS), minimum norm least squares (MNLS), standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) and spatio-temporal current dipole modeling inverse methods were then applied to the peak of the averaged ictal discharges EEG data. MNLS and sLORETA pointed to a single center of activity. Moving and rotating single dipole fits resulted in an explained variance of more than 97%. The non-invasive EEG source analysis methods localized at the border of the lesion and at the border of the iEEG electrodes which mainly received ictal discharges. Source orientation was towards the epileptogenic tissue. For the reconstructed superficial source, brain conductivity anisotropy and the lesion conductivity had only a minor influence, whereas a correct modeling of the highly conducting CSF compartment and the anisotropic skull was found to be important. The proposed FE forward modeling approach strongly simplifies meshing and reduces run-time (37 ms for one forward computation in the model with 3.1 million unknowns), corroborating the practical feasibility of the approach.

Although reperfusion is the deciding factor with respect to this dramatic response to revascularisation therapy, the influence of pre- and post-treatment diffusioneperfusion status on the speed and degree of recovery are unknown.
Methods Consecutive stroke patients who were eligible for revascularisation therapy underwent serial diffusion-perfusion MRI. Tmax perfusion maps were generated, and stroke severity and recovery were assessed up to day 90. The relationship of diffusion and perfusion lesion indices with the speed and degree of recovery were evaluated.; Results 69 patients (42 men; aged 66.3 +- 15.9 years) were included; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 13.3 +- 6.4 points. 19 received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and 50 received endovascular therapy withwithout intravenous tPA. Early dramatic improvement (NIHSS score reduction of >= 40% within 24 h) was observed in 24 (34.8%) patients. Among the other 45 patients, 18 (40%) showed good outcomes (modified Rankin score 0-2 at day 90), suggesting delayed recovery. The volume of post-treatment perfusion delay was similar between the early and delayed recovery groups (p=0.329) but smaller than in the non-responders group (p<0.05). Multivariate testing revealed that smaller post-treatment perfusion delay volumes were independently associated with both early dramatic improvement and delayed recovery. In addition, initial diffusion weighted imaging lesion volume was smaller in the former than in the latter (p=0.029) and was independently associated with early dramatic recovery.; Conclusions A significant proportion of patients with a lack of early dramatic improvement (40%) showed delayed recovery. Both pretreatment infarct volume and post-treatment reperfusion correlated with the degree and speed of recovery.

N2  -  Two diffusion-based approaches, CG (constant gradient) and FEXI (filtered exchange imaging) methods, have been previously proposed for measuring transcytolemmal water exchange rate constant k(in), but their accuracy and feasibility have not been comprehensively evaluated and compared. In this work, both computer simulations and cell experiments in vitro were performed to evaluate these two methods. Simulations were done with different cell diameters (5, 10, 201 mu m), a broad range of k(in) values (0.02-30 s(-1)) and different SNR's, and simulated k(in)'s were directly compared with the ground truth values. Human leukemia K562 cells were cultured and treated with saponin to selectively change cell transmembrane permeability. The agreement between measured kin's of both methods was also evaluated. The results suggest that, without noise, the CG method provides reasonably accurate estimation of kin especially when it is smaller than 10 s(-1), which is in the typical physiological range of many biological tissues. However, although the FEXI method overestimates k(in) even with corrections for the effects of extracellular water fraction, it provides reasonable estimates with practical SNR's and more importantly, the fitted apparent exchange rate AXR showed approximately linear dependence on the ground truth k(in). In conclusion, either CG or FEXI method provides a sensitive means to characterize the variations in transcytolemmal water exchange rate constant k(in), although the accuracy and specificity is usually compromised. The non-imaging CG method provides more accurate estimation of k(in), but limited to large volume-of interest. Although the accuracy of FEXI is compromised with extracellular volume fraction, it is capable of spatially mapping kin in practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective: Unusual clinical course
Background: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) is a rare clinical and radiological syndrome that has been associated with various infectious etiologies. CLOCC are among the recently described neurological associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case of CLOCC in a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with auditory hallucinations and rapidly developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).; Case Report: A 23-year-old man with no past medical and psychiatric history presented with auditory hallucinations, restlessness, and suicidal ideations. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2. A brain MRI revealed an isolated oval-shaped lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, suggestive of CLOCC. After a dramatic hospital course associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and severe intra-abdominal and cerebral bleeding, he developed cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 15.; Conclusions: This case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it suggests that CLOCC can be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with unexplained neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, leading to poor outcome.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On DWI and DSC-PWI, hemangioblastomas and brain metastases may exhibit different signal intensities depending on their cellularity and angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a hemangioblastoma can be differentiated from a single brain metastasis with DWI and DSC-PWI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed DWI, DSC-PWI, and conventional MR imaging of 21 patients with hemangioblastomas and 30 patients with a single brain metastasis. Variables of minimum ADC and relative ADC were acquired by DWI and the parameter of relative maximum CBV, by DSC-PWI. Minimum ADC, relative ADC, and relative maximum CBV values were compared between hemangioblastomas and brain metastases by using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were determined.; RESULTS: Both the minimum ADC values and relative ADC ratios were significantly higher in hemangioblastomas compared with brain metastases (P < .001 for both minimum ADC values and relative ADC ratios). The same was true for the relative maximum CBV ratio (P < .002). The threshold value of 6.59 for relative maximum CBV provided sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 95.24%, 53.33%, and 70.59%, respectively, for differentiating hemangioblastomas from brain metastases. Compared with relative maximum CBV, relative ADC had high sensitivity (95.24%), specificity (96.67%), and accuracy (96.08%) using the threshold value of 1.54. The optimal threshold value for minimum ADC was 1.1 x 10(-3) mm(2)s.; CONCLUSIONS: DWI and DSC-PWI are helpful in the characterization and differentiation of hemangioblastomas from brain metastases. DWI appears to be the most efficient MR imaging technique for providing a distinct differentiation of the 2 tumor types.

N2  -  Solid pieces of fetal locus coeruleus (LC) or superior cervical ganglion (SCG) were placed into a fimbria-fornix lesion cavity in 6 hydroxydopamine-treated, noradrenaline (NA)-denervated rats. Six to 8 months later, all animals were subjected to electrical kindling stimulations in the hippocampus until they had reached the fully kindled state. Nongrafted lesioned animals showed markedly increased kindling rate which was partly attenuated by LC but not SCG grafts. In both LC- and SCG-grafted animals, dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunocytochemistry demonstrated a high density of graft-derived noradrenergic fibers in the dorsal hippocampus, whereas reinnervation of the ventral hippocampus was much more sparse. Subregional distribution of these fibers within the hippocampus was different in the two grafted groups. Both grafts partly restored basal extracellular NA levels in the hippocampus and reacted to generalized seizures by a significant (two- to threefold) increase of NA release, as measured by intracerebral microdialysis. Our data indicate (i) that seizure activity can regulate transmitter release from noradrenergic neurons in both LC and SCG grafts, (ii) that only fetal LC grafts retard seizure development in kindling, and (iii) that the inability of SCG implants to influence kindling epileptogenesis could be due to a lack of synaptic contacts between the graft-derived ganglionic fibers and host hippocampal neurons.

N2  -  Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) is used to identify brain regions that are receiving enough blood supply to remain structurally intact, but not enough to function normally. Previous observations suggest that spatial neglect due to subcortical stroke can be explained by dysfunction of cortical areas rather than through the neuronal loss in the subcortical structures itself. The present study aimed to identify the dysfunctional cortical regions induced by basal ganglia stroke in patients with spatial neglect. In a patient group with stroke lesions centring on the basal ganglia, we examined the common area(s) of structurally intact but dysfunctional cortical tissue by using spatial normalization of PWI maps as well as symmetric voxel-wise inter-hemispheric comparisons. These new techniques allow comparison of the structurally intact but abnormally perfused areas of different individuals in the same stereotaxic space, and at the same time avoid problems due to regional perfusion differences and to possible observer-dependent biases. We found that strokes centring on the right basal ganglia which provoke spatial neglect induce abnormal perfusion in a circumscribed area of intact cortex that typically involves those three regions that have previously been described to provoke spatial neglect when damaged directly by cortical infarction: the superior temporal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule and the inferior frontal gyrus. The data suggest that spatial neglect following a right basal ganglia lesion typically is caused by the dysfunction of (part of) these specific cortical areas.

N2  -  Objectives: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).Case description: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and foot at similar to 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3 similar to 4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6.Results: On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT.Conclusions: This study recommends further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain.

N2  -  Purpose: To develop a DWI sequence with multiple readout echo-trains in a single shot (multi-readout DWI) over a reduced FOV, and to demonstrate its ability to achieve high data acquisition efficiency in the study of coupling between diffusion and relaxation in the human prostate. Methods: The proposed multi-readout DWI sequence plays out multiple EPI readout echo-trains after a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion preparation module. Each EPI readout echo-train corresponded to a distinct effective TE. To maintain a high spatial resolution with a relatively short echo-train for each readout, a 2D RF pulse was used to limit the FOV. Experiments were performed on the prostate of six healthy subjects to acquire a set of images with three b values (0, 500, and 1000 s/mm(2)) and three TEs (63.0, 78.8, and 94.6 ms), producing three ADC maps at different TEs and three T-2(*) maps at different b values. Results: Multi-readout DWI enabled a threefold acceleration without compromising the spatial resolution when compared with a conventional single-readout sequence. Images with three b values and three TEs were obtained in 3 min 40 s with an adequate SNR (>= 26.9). The ADC values (1.45 +/- 0.13, 1.52 +/- 0.14, and 1.58 +/- 0.15 mu m(2)/ms; P < 0.01) exhibited an increasing trend as TEs increased (63.0 ms, 78.8 ms, and 94.6 ms), whereas T-2(*) values (74.78 +/- 13.21, 63.21 +/- 7.84, and 56.61 +/- 5.05 ms; P < 0.01) decreases as the b values increased (0, 500, and 1000 s/mm(2)). Conclusion: The multi-readout DWI sequence over a reduced FOV provides a time-efficient technique to study the coupling between diffusion and relaxation times.

N2  -  PurposeTo evaluate the usefulness of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) imaging in differentiating high-grade gliomas from lymphomas and in noninvasively predicting genetic biomarkers in high-grade gliomas.
Materials and MethodsTwelve glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 3 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 5 recurred GBM, and 9 lymphoma patients underwent conventional MR and pCASL imaging. On pCASL perfusion map, mean absolute tumor blood flow (mTBF) was calculated from five regions of interest (ROIs) within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Relative TBF (rTBF = mTBFmBF(gm) x 100) was also calculated. mTBF and rTBF of high-grade gliomas and lymphomas were compared using unpaired Student's t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additionally, the association of TBF and six immunohistochemically confirmed genetic biomarkers was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis in the group of high-grade gliomas.; ResultsBoth mTBF and rTBF of the high-grade gliomas were significantly higher than those of the lymphomas: 92.1 34.7 versus 53.6 +- 30.5 mLmin100 mg (P = 0.008) and 182.3 +- 69.5 versus 92.5 +- 44.9 (P = 0.002), respectively. Only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression status showed a significant positive correlation with mTBF(P = 0.015) and rTBF(P = 0.007).; ConclusionpCASL imaging may facilitate differentiation of high-grade gliomas from lymphomas and prediction of EGFR expression status in high-grade gliomas.

N2  -  xThe measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water in brains of stroke patients is used in models developed to help distinguish reversible from irreversible ischemic injury. The ADC by conventional methods may be overestimated by the presence of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in sulci and perivascular spaces. In this study the hypothesis that DWI with CSF suppression (FLAIR-DWI) would result in different ADC values than those obtained with the conventional DWI technique was investigated. Thirty-one patients with stroke onset of less than 6 hr and an acute lesion on conventional DWI were studied. Both conventional isotropic DWI and FLAIR-DWI were performed using a single-shot echo-planar technique. In all 31 patients, CSF-suppressed ADC was lower than conventional ADC. The mean (SD) of the 31 patients' lesion ADC was 0.64 (0.08) X 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) with FLAIR-DWI and 0.72 (0.09) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) with conventional DWI (P < 0.001). The overestimation of ADC in conventional DWI corresponded to the percentage of the voxel that contained CSF. Suppression of CSF leads to lesion ADC values that are more homogeneous and more than 15% lower than those obtained with conventional DWI techniques. This suggests that FLAIR-DWI ADC measurements are more accurate than conventional ADC maps. Published 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.(dagger)

N2  -  Understanding the intricate three-dimensional relationship between fiber bundles and subcortical nuclei is not a simple task. It is of paramount importance in neurosciences, especially in the field of functional neurosurgery. The current methods for in vivo and post mortem fiber tract visualization have shortcomings and contributions to the field are welcome. Several tracts were chosen to implement a new technique to help visualization of white matter tracts, using high-thickness histology and dark field images. Our study describes the use of computational fluid dynamic simulations for visualization of 3D fiber tracts segmented from dark field microscopy in high-thickness histological slices (histological mesh tractography). A post mortem human brain was MRI scanned prior to skull extraction, histologically processed and serially cut at 430 mu m thickness as previously described by our group. High-resolution dark field images were used to segment the outlines of the structures. These outlines served as basis for the construction of a 3D structured mesh, were a Finite Volume Method (FVM) simulation of water flow was performed to generate streamlines representing the geometry. The simulations were accomplished by an open source computer fluid dynamics software. The resulting simulation rendered a realistic 3D impression of the segmented anterior commissure, the left anterior limb of the internal capsule, the left uncinate fascicle, and the dentato-rubral tracts. The results are in line with clinical findings, diffusion MR imaging and anatomical dissection methods.

N2  -  Brain tumour microstructure is potentially predictive of changes following treatment to cognitive functions subserved by the functional networks in which they are embedded. To test this hypothesis, intra-tumoural microstructure was quantified from diffusion-weighted MRI to identify which tumour subregions (if any) had a greater impact on participants' cognitive recovery after surgical resection. Additionally, we studied the role of tumour microstructure in the functional interaction between the tumour and the rest of the brain. Sixteen patients (22-56 years, 7 females) with brain tumours located in or near speech-eloquent areas of the brain were included in the analyses. Two different approaches were adopted for tumour segmentation from a multishell diffusion MRI acquisition: the first used a two-dimensional four group partition of feature space, whilst the second used data-driven clustering with Gaussian mixture modelling. For each approach, we assessed the capability of tumour microstructure to predict participants' cognitive outcomes after surgery and the strength of association between the BOLD signal of individual tumour subregions and the global BOLD signal. With both methodologies, the volumes of partially overlapped subregions within the tumour significantly predicted cognitive decline in verbal skills after surgery. We also found that these particular subregions were among those that showed greater functional interaction with the unaffected cortex. Our results indicate that tumour microstructure measured by MRI multishell diffusion is associated with cognitive recovery after surgery.

N2  -  Applying frontal transcortical approach to treat lateral ventricular tumor is one of the most common neurosurgical manipulations. The frontal transcortical approach generally passes through the middle frontal gyrus in which there is no major function involved in the traditional sense. However, current researches have suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in the whole network of the brain cognitive frame. In addition, cognitive function is crucial in growing and developmental stages and essential for the educational achievement, especially for children. Based on this, the authors in this study analyzed cognitive performance change of pediatric patients who had accepted frontal transcortical operation in 1-year follow-up and discussed the possibility of higher cognitive functions of the damaged region.
In this single-center study, 15 pediatric patients (median age at surgery, 9.21 years old; range, 6.42-14.17 years old) who had been treated with frontal transcortical approach for lateral ventricular tumors were selected as research objects. The cognitive function assessment was conducting by adopting the revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition (WISC-IV). In addition, the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were carried out to measure the level of co-activation and to explore the functional connectivity between the brain regions at the preoperative period and 1-year follow-up after surgery.; GTR was achieved in all patients, and all patients were in good condition after surgery. Compared to the preoperative indices of WISC-IV, patients generally had a lower level of indices of the WISC-IV after surgery, for example, the total IQ was declined to M = 83.60, SD = 9.500 from M = 95.33, SD = 13.844 within 1 year convalescence. The data of perceptual reasoning (t = - 2.392, p = 0.016), processing speed (t = - 2.121, p = 0.033), and total IQ (t = -2.638, p = 0.008) before and after surgery showed statistically significance. Furthermore, decreased functional connectivity and disconnected neural fasciculus were revealed by the size of activation regions in the resting-state fMRI and the reconstruction of three-dimensional images of white matter tracts in the DTI pre- and post-operative.; The PFC was not regarded as a major functional area in the past, but the researches at present have shown that the interactions between PFC and other posterior brain regions serve as the basis of the higher cognitive functions. According to imaging manifestations and WISC-IV tasks in this paper, we found that the PFC injury caused by the frontal transcortical approach led to damaged brain structure and impaired the performance of cognitive function. On this basis, we detected that the perceptual reasoning and processing speed maybe have more extensive connections with the middle frontal gyrus.

N2  -  Although the clinical applications of F-18-FDG PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) are similar to each other in head and neck cancer, the image acquisition methods in the 2 modalities are significantly different. F-18-FDG PET/CT traces glucose metabolism, a nonspecific process essential for tumor growth. On the other hand, DWI provides information on Brownian motion of water molecules in tissues, which represents cellularity. The aim of our study was to investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values at b = 1,000 (ADC(1,000)) and 2,000 (ADC(2,000)) s/mm(2) or whether the change (ADC(ratio)) of ADC values from b = 1,000 to 2,000 s/mm2 has any significant correlation with the standardized uptake value (SUV) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods: Our hospital's institutional review board approved this retrospective study. We included 47 patients (32 men and 15 women) with histopathologically proven HNSCC, who underwent both DWI (at both b = 1,000 s/mm(2) and b = 2,000 s/mm(2)) and F-18-FDG PET/CT in the 2 wk before treatment. ADC(ratio) maps were generated using a pixel-by-pixel computation for which ADCratio is (ADC(2,000)/ADC(1,000)) x 100. The mean ADC(1,000), ADC(2,000), and ADCratio values were evaluated within a manually placed polygonal region of interest within the main tumor on every slice of the ADC(1,000), ADC(2,000), and ADCratio maps, respectively. In addition, the maximal SUV (SUVmax) and mean SUV (SUVmean) were measured for the entire tumor region of interest. Comparisons were made using Pearson correlation analysis, and partial correlation coefficients were derived. Results: No significant correlation was found between the mean ADC(1,000) and SUVmean (r = -0.222, P = 0.1325) or the mean ADC(2,000) and SUVmean ( r = -0.1214, P = 0.4163). However, the ADC(ratio) was significantly and positively correlated to both the SUVmean ( r = 0.667, P < 0.001) and SUVmax ( r = 0.5855, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The ADC(ratio) and SUV were significantly correlated with each other in primary HNSCC patients, possibly because of a higher-cellularity region as a result of relatively increased tumor proliferation. Further studies are warranted to investigate the possible complementary role of DWI and PET/CT in various clinical settings, including staging and treatment response.

N2  -  State-of-the-art glioma treatment aims to maximise neuro-oncological benefit while minimising losses in quality of life. Optimising this balance remains hindered by our still limited understanding of information processing in the human brain. To help understand individual differences in functional outcomes following neuro-oncological treatment, we review mounting evidence demonstrating the fundamental role that white matter connections play in complex human behaviour. We focus on selected fibre tracts whose destruction is recognised to elicit predictable behavioural deficits and consider specific indications for non-invasive diffusion MRI tractography, the only existing method to map these fibre tracts in vivo, in the selection and planning of neuro-oncological treatments. Despite remaining challenges, longitudinal tract imaging, in combination with intraoperative testing and neuropsychological evaluation, offers unique opportunities to refine our understanding of human brain organisation in the quest to predict and ultimately reduce the quality of life burden of both surgical and non-surgical first-line neuro-oncological therapies.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) accounts for a significant portion of primary intra-axial lesions in cases of traumatic brain injury, The goal of this study was to nse diffusion-weighted MR imaging to characterize DAI in the setting of acute and subacute traumatic brain injury.
METHODS: Nine patients ranging in age from 26 to 78 years were examined with conventional MR imaging (including fast spin-echo T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery, and gradient-echo sequences) as well as echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging 1 to 18 days after traumatic injury, Lesions were characterized as DAI on the basis of their location and their appearance on conventional MR images. Trace apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were computed off-line with the diffusion-weighted and base-line images. Areas of increased signal were identified on the diffusion-weighted images, and regions of interests were used to obtain trace ADC values.; RESULTS: In the nine patients studied, isotropic diffusion-weighted images showed areas of increased signal with correspondingly decreased ADC, In one case, decreased ADC was seen 18 days after the initial event,; CONCLUSION: Decreased ADC can be demonstrated in patients with DAI in the acute setting and may persist into the subacute period, beyond that described for cytotoxic edema in ischemia.

N2  -  Background New technologies developed to improve survival outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM) continue to have limited success. Recently, image-guided dose painting (DP) radiotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy to increase local control rates. In this study, we evaluate the practical application of a multiparametric MRI model of glioma infiltration for DP radiotherapy in GBM by measuring its conformity, feasibility, and expected clinical benefits against standard of care treatment. Methods Maps of tumor probability were generated from perfusion/diffusion MRI data from 17 GBM patients via a previously developed model of GBM infiltration. Prescriptions for DP were linearly derived from tumor probability maps and used to develop dose optimized treatment plans. Conformity of DP plans to dose prescriptions was measured via a quality factor. Feasibility of DP plans was evaluated by dose metrics to target volumes and critical brain structures. Expected clinical benefit of DP plans was assessed by tumor control probability. The DP plans were compared to standard radiotherapy plans. Results The conformity of the DP plans was >90%. Compared to the standard plans, DP (1) did not affect dose delivered to organs at risk; (2) increased mean and maximum dose and improved minimum dose coverage for the target volumes; (3) reduced minimum dose within the radiotherapy treatment margins; (4) improved local tumor control probability within the target volumes for all patients. Conclusions A multiparametric MRI model of GBM infiltration can enable conformal, feasible, and potentially beneficial dose painting radiotherapy plans.

N2  -  The exact anatomical localization of right hemisphere lesions that lead to left spatial neglect is still debated. The effect of confounding factors such as acute diaschisis and hypoperfusion, visual field defects, and lesion size may account for conflicting results that have been reported in the literature. Here, we present a comprehensive anatomical investigation of the gray- and white matter lesion correlates of left spatial neglect, which was run in a sample 58 patients with subacute or chronic vascular strokes in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Standard voxel-based correlates confirmed the role played by lesions in the posterior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and temporalparietal junction), in the frontal cortex (frontal eye field, middle and inferior frontal gyrus), and in the underlying parietalfrontal white matter. Using a new diffusion tensor imaging-based atlas of the human brain, we were able to run, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the lesion involvement of subcortical white matter pathways. The results of this analysis revealed that, among the different pathways linking parietal with frontal areas, damage to the second branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF II) was the best predictor of left spatial neglect. The group study also revealed a subsample of patients with neglect due to focal lesion in the lateraldorsal portion of the thalamus, which connects the premotor cortex with the inferior parietal lobule. The relevance of fronto-parietal disconnection was further supported by complete in vivo tractography dissection of white matter pathways in 2 patients, one with and the other without signs of neglect. These 2 patients were studied both in the acute phase and 1 year after stroke and were perfectly matched for age, handedness, stroke onset, lesion size, and for cortical lesion involvement. Taken together, the results of the present study support the hypothesis that anatomical disconnections leading to a functional breakdown of parietalfrontal networks are an important pathophysiological factor leading to chronic left spatial neglect. Here, we propose that different loci of SLF disconnection on the rostro-caudal axis can also be associated with disconnection of short-range white matter pathways within the frontal or parietal areas. Such different local disconnection patterns can play a role in the important clinical variability of the neglect syndrome.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:This study identified a clinically significant subset of patients with glioma with tumor outside of contrast enhancement present at autopsy and subsequently developed a method for detecting nonenhancing tumor using radio-pathomic mapping. We tested the hypothesis that autopsy-based radio-pathomic tumor probability maps would be able to noninvasively identify areas of infiltrative tumor beyond traditional imaging signatures. METHODS:A total of 159 tissue samples from 65 subjects were aligned to MRI acquired nearest to death for this retrospective study. Demographic and survival characteristics for patients with and without tumor beyond the contrast-enhancing margin were computed. An ensemble algorithm was used to predict pixelwise tumor presence from pathological annotations using segmented cellularity (Cell), extracellular fluid, and cytoplasm density as input (6 train/3 test subjects). A second level of ensemble algorithms was used to predict voxelwise Cell, extracellular fluid, and cytoplasm on the full data set (43 train/22 test subjects) using 5-by-5 voxel tiles from T1, T1 + C, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and apparent diffusion coefficient as input. The models were then combined to generate noninvasive whole brain maps of tumor probability. RESULTS:Tumor outside of contrast was identified in 41.5% of patients, who showed worse survival outcomes (hazard ratio = 3.90, P < .001). Tumor probability maps reliably tracked nonenhancing tumor on a range of local and external unseen data, identifying tumor outside of contrast in 69% of presurgical cases that also showed reduced survival outcomes (hazard ratio = 1.67, P = .027). CONCLUSION:This study developed a multistage model for mapping gliomas using autopsy tissue samples as ground truth, which was able to identify regions of tumor beyond traditional imaging signatures.

N2  -  Introduction: Perinatal stroke (PS) is a focal vascular brain injury and the leading cause of hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Motor impairments last a lifetime but treatments are limited. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance motor learning in adults but tDCS effects on motor learning are less studied in children. Imaging-based simulations of tDCS-induced electric fields (EF) suggest differences in the developing brain compared to adults but have not been applied to common pediatric disease states. We created estimates of tDCS-induced EF strength using five tDCS montages targeting the motor system in children with PS [arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) or periventricular infarction (PVI)] and typically developing controls (TDC) aged 6-19 years to explore associates between simulation values and underlying anatomy.Methods: Simulations were performed using SimNIBS using T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted images. After tissue segmentation and tetrahedral mesh generation, tDCS-induced EF was estimated based on the finite element model (FEM). Five 1mA tDCS montages targeting motor function in the paretic (non-dominant) hand were simulated. Estimates of peak EF strength, EF angle, field focality, and mean EF in motor cortex (M1) were extracted for each montage and compared between groups.Results: Simulations for eighty-three children were successfully completed (21 AIS, 30 PVI, 32 TDC). Conventional tDCS montages utilizing anodes over lesioned cortex had higher peak EF strength values for the AIS group compared to TDC. These montages showed lower mean EF strength within target M1 regions suggesting that peaks were not necessarily localized to motor network-related targets. EF angle was lower for TDC compared to PS groups for a subset of montages. Montages using anodes over lesioned cortex were more sensitive to variations in underlying anatomy (lesion and tissue volumes) than those using cathodes over non-lesioned cortex.Discussion:Individualized patient-centered tDCS EF simulations are prudent for clinical trial planning and may provide insight into the efficacy of tDCS interventions in children with PS.

N2  -  Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) allows new insights into tissue composition and organization by assessing its magnetic property. Previous QSM studies have already demonstrated that magnetic susceptibility is highly sensitive to myelin density and fiber orientation as well as to para-and diamagnetic trace elements. Image resolution in QSM with current approaches is limited by the long acquisition time of 3D scans and the need for high signal to noise ratio (SNR) to solve the dipole inversion problem.
We here propose a new total-generalized-variation (TGV) based method for QSM reconstruction, which incorporates individual steps of phase unwrapping, background field removal and dipole inversion in a single iteration, thus yielding a robust solution to the reconstruction problem. This approach has beneficial characteristics for low SNR data, allowing for phase data to be rapidly acquired with a 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. The proposed method was evaluated with a numerical phantom and in vivo at 3 and 7 T.; Compared to total variation (TV), TGV-QSM enforced higher order smoothness which yielded solutions closer to the ground truth and prevented stair-casing artifacts. The acquisition time for images with 1 mm isotropic resolution and whole brain coverage was 10 s on a clinical 3 Tesla scanner.; In conclusion, 3D EPI acquisition combined with single-step TGV reconstruction yields reliable QSM images of the entire brain with 1 mm isotropic resolution in seconds. The short acquisition time combined with the robust reconstruction may enable new QSM applications in less compliant populations, clinical susceptibility tensor imaging, and functional resting state examinations.

N2  -  Objectives: To assess in a large population of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) the relevance of brain lesion location and frequency in predicting 1-year conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS).
Methods: In this multicenter, retrospective study, clinical and MRI data at onset and clinical follow-up at 1 year were collected for 1,165 patients with CIS. On T2-weighted MRI, we generated lesion probability maps of white matter (WM) lesion location and frequency. Voxelwise analyses were performed with a nonparametric permutation-based approach (p < 0.05, cluster-corrected).; Results: In CIS patients with hemispheric, multifocal, and brainstemcerebellar onset, lesion probability map clusters were seen in clinically eloquent brain regions. Significant lesion clusters were not found in CIS patients with optic nerve and spinal cord onset. At 1 year, clinically definite MS developed in 26% of patients. The converting group, despite a greater baseline lesion load compared with the nonconverting group (7 +- 8.1 cm(3) vs 4.6 +- 6.7 cm(3), p < 0.001), showed less widespread lesion distribution (18% vs 25% of brain voxels occupied by lesions). High lesion frequency was found in the converting group in projection, association, and commissural WM tracts, with larger clusters being in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and cingulum.; Conclusions: Higher frequency of lesion occurrence in clinically eloquent WM tracts can characterize CIS subjects with different types of onset. The involvement of specific WM tracts, in particular those traversed by fibers involved in motor function and near the corpus callosum, seems to be associated with a higher risk of clinical conversion to MS in the short term.

N2  -  Introduction
Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), which is based on Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) protocols, is becoming increasingly important for neurosurgical applications. However, its use in this context is limited in part by significant spatial distortion inherent to EPI.; Method; We evaluated an efficient algorithm for EPI distortion correction (EPIC) across 814 DWI scans from 250 brain tumor patients and quantified the magnitude of geometric distortion for whole brain and multiple brain regions.; Results; Evaluation of the algorithm's performance revealed significantly higher mutual information between T1-weighted pre-contrast images and corrected b = 0 images than the uncorrected b = 0 images (p < 0.001). The distortion magnitude across all voxels revealed a median EPI distortion effect of 2.1 mm, ranging from 1.2 mm to 5.9 mm, the 5th and 95th percentile, respectively. Regions adjacent to bone-air interfaces, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal poles, and brain stem, were the regions most severely affected by DWI distortion.; Conclusion; Using EPIC to estimate the degree of distortion in 814 DWI brain tumor images enabled the creation of a topographic atlas of DWI distortion across the brain. The degree of displacement of tumors boundaries in uncorrected images is severe but can be corrected for using EPIC. Our results support the use of distortion correction to ensure accurate and careful application of DWI to neurosurgical practice.

N2  -  Reduction of the cerebral perfusion pressure caused by vessel occlusion or stenosis is a cause of neurological symptoms and border-zone infarctions The aim of this article is to describe perfusion patterns in hemodynamic stroke, to give a practical approach for the assessment of colour encoded CT- and MR-perfusion maps and to demonstrate the clinical use of comprehensive imaging in the workup of patients with hemodynamic stroke.
Five patients with different duration cause and degree of hemodynamic stroke were selected. The patients shared the typical presentation with fluctuating and transient symptoms. All were examined by MR or CT angiography and MR or CT perfusion in the symptomatic phase All patients were examined with diffusion weighted imaging. All five cases showed the altered perfusion patterns of hemodynamic insufficiency with a slight or marked Increase in CBV in the supply area of the affected vessel and only slightly reduced or maintained CBF. The perfusion disturbances were most easily detected on the MTT maps. Border-zone Infarctions were seen in all cases.; The typical pattern for hemodynamic insufficiency is characterized by increased CB V, normal or decreased CBF and prolonged MTT in the affected areas The increased CBV is the hallmark of stressed autoregulation. Reading the color-encoded perfusion maps enables a quick and robust assessment of the cerebral pet fusion and its characteristic patterns. Internal border-zone infarctions can be regarded as a marker for hemodynamic insufficiency. Finding of the typical rosary-like pattern of DWI lesions should call for further work up.

N2  -  Background Acute lacunar ischaemic stroke, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes are all features of cerebral small vessel disease. It is unclear why some small vessel disease lesions present with acute stroke symptoms, whereas others typically do not.
Aim To test if lesion location could be one reason why some small vessel disease lesions present with acute stroke, whereas others accumulate covertly.; Methods We identified prospectively patients who presented with acute lacunar stroke symptoms with a recent small subcortical infarct confirmed on magnetic resonance diffusion imaging. We compared the distribution of the acute infarcts with that of white matter hyperintensity and lacunes using computational image mapping methods.; Results In 188 patients, mean age 67 +- standard deviation 12 years, the lesions that presented with acute lacunar ischaemic stroke were located in or near the main motor and sensory tracts in (descending order): posterior limb of the internal capsule (probability density 0.2mm(3)), centrum semiovale (probability density = 0.15mm(3)), medial lentiform nucleus lateral thalamus (probability density = 0.09mm(3)), and pons (probability density = 0. 02mm(3)). Most lacunes were in the lentiform nucleus (probability density = 0.01-0.04mm(3)) or exter-nal capsule (probability density = 0.05mm(3)). Most white matter hyperintensities were in centrum semiovale (except for the area affected by the acute symptomatic infarcts), external capsules, basal ganglia, and brainstem, with little overlap with the acute symptomatic infarcts (analysis of variance, P < 0.01).; Conclusions Lesions that present with acute lacunar ischaemic stroke symptoms may be more likely noticed by the patient through affecting the main motor and sensory tracts, whereas white matter hyperintensity and asymptomatic lacunes mainly affect other areas. Brain location could at least partly explain the symptomatic vs. covert development of small vessel disease.

N2  -  Aims: Late auditory evoked potentials, and notably mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3 responses, can be used as part of the multimodal prognostic evaluation in post-anoxic disorders of consciousness (DOC). MMN response preferentially stems from the temporal cortex and the arcuate fascicu-lus. Situations with discrepant evaluations, for example MMN absent but P3 present, are frequent and difficult to interpret. We hypothesize that dis-crepant MMN-/P3+ results could reflect a higher prevalence of lesions in MMN generating regions. This study presents correlations between neurophysiological and neuroradiological results.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 38 post-anoxic DOC patients. Brain lesions were analyzed on 3T MRI both anatomically and through computation of the local arcuate fasciculus fractional anisotropy values on Diffusion Tensor Imaging sequences. Neurophysiological data and outcome were also analyzed.Results: Our cohort included 8 MMN-/P3+, 7 MMN+/P3+, 21 MMN-/P3-and 2 MMN-/P3+ patients, assessed ata median delay of 20.5 days since cardiac arrest. Our results show that MMN-/P3+ patients tended to have fewer temporal and basal ganglia lesions than MMN-/P3-patients, and more than MMN+/P3+ patients (p-values for trend: p = 0.02 for temporal and p = 0.02 for basal ganglia lesions). There was a statistical difference across groups for mean fractional anisotropy values in the arcuate fasciculus (p = 0.008). The percentage of patients regaining consciousness at three months in MMN-/P3+ patients was higher than in MMN-/P3-patients and lower than in MMN+/P3+ patients.Conclusion: This study suggests that discrepancies in late auditory evoked potentials may be linked to focal post-anoxic brain lesions, visible on brain MRI.

N2  -  Background: Subcaudate tractotomy is a functional ablative procedure performed for treatment-resistant psychiatric disease, targeting the white matter tracts ventral to the head of the caudate nucleus. The white matter anatomy of this region has extensive interindividual variability, and this is thought to impact upon the treatment response to ablative and deep brain stimulation procedures. Objective: We aim to assess in detail the white matter tract anatomy and topographic variability underlying subcaudate tractotomy. Methods: 74 non-depressed adult volunteers underwent MRI including diffusion tensor imaging. Individualized regions of interest were formed in both hemispheres using native non-normalized data to simulate a subcaudate tractotomy. Tractography and analysis were performed and the exact tract locations measured including mean distances and standard deviations to assess variability. Results: The cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, corticostriatal fibres, and corticothalamic fibres were consistently demonstrated. The location of the cingulum bundle was consistent across subjects, but there was extensive interindividual variability in the topographic location of the other tracts. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a detailed analysis of the white matter tracts and their anatomical variability underlying subcaudate tractotomy. This has significant implications for neurosurgical targeting. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  Turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences have been applied to estimate T-2 relaxation times in clinically feasible scan times. However, T-2 estimations using TSE pulse sequences has been shown to differ considerable from reference standard sequences due to several sources of error. The purpose of this work was to apply voxel-sensitivity formalism to correct for one such source of error introduced by differing phase encoding profile orders with dual-echo TSE pulse sequences. The American College of Radiology phantom and the brains of two healthy volunteers were imaged using dual-echo TSE as well as 32-echo spin-echo acquisitions and T-2 estimations from uncorrected and voxel-sensitivity formalism-corrected dual-echo TSE and 32-echo acquisitions were compared. In all regions of the brain and the majority of the analyses of the American College of Radiology phantom, voxel-sensitivity formalism correction resulted in considerable improvements in dual-echo TSE T-2 estimation compared with the 32-echo acquisition, with improvements in T-2 value accuracy ranging from 5.2% to 18.6%.

N2  -  Background: Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion MRI (dMRI) have been asso-ciated with cell density and tissue anisotropy across tumors, but it is unknown whether these associations persist at the microscopic level. Purpose: To quantify the degree to which cell density and anisotropy, as determined from histology, account for the intra-tumor variability of MD and FA in meningioma tumors. Furthermore, to clarify whether other histo-logical features account for additional intra-tumor variability of dMRI parameters. Materials and Methods: We performed ex-vivo dMRI at 200 mu m isotropic resolution and histological imaging of 16 excised meningioma tumor samples. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to map MD and FA, as well as the in-plane FA (FAIP). Histology images were analyzed in terms of cell nuclei density (CD) and structure anisotropy (SA; obtained from structure tensor analysis) and were used separately in a regression analysis to predict MD and FAIP, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was also trained to predict the dMRI parameters from histology patches. The association between MRI and histology was analyzed in terms of out-of-sample (R,S) on the intra-tumor level and within-sample R2 across tumors. Regions where the dMRI parameters were poorly predicted from histology were analyzed to identify features apart from CD and SA that could influence MD and FAIP, respectively. Results: Cell density assessed by histology poorly explained intra-tumor variability of MD at the mesoscopic level (200 mu m), as median R,S = 0.04 (interquartile range 0.01-0.26). Structure anisotropy explained more of the variation in FAIP (median R,S = 0.31, 0.20-0.42). Samples with low R,S for FAIP exhibited low variations throughout the samples and thus low explainable variability, however, this was not the case for MD. Across tumors, CD and SA were clearly associated with MD (R2 = 0.60) and FAIP (R2 = 0.81), respectively. In 37% of the samples (6 out of 16), cell density did not explain intra-tumor variability of MD when compared to the degree explained by the CNN. Tumor vascularization, psammoma bodies, microcysts, and tissue cohesivity were asso-ciated with bias in MD prediction based solely on CD. Our results support that FAIP is high in the presence of elongated and aligned cell structures, but low otherwise.

T2  -  MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS

N2  -  Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the concerns of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and has been related to myelin loss. Different neuroimaging methods have been used to quantify myelin and relate it to cognitive dysfunctions, among them Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and, more recently, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with C-11-PIB.
Objective: To investigate different myelin imaging modalities as predictors of cognitive dysfunction.; Methods: Fifty-one MS patients and 24 healthy controls underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment and MTR, DTI (Axial Diffusion-AD and Fractional Anisotropy-FA maps), and C-11-PIB PET images in a PETMR hybrid system.; Results: MTR and DTI(FA) differed in patients with or without cognitive impairment. There was an association of DTI(FA) and DTI(AD) with cognition and psychomotor speed for progressive MS, and of C-11-PIB uptake and MTR for relapsing-remitting MS. MTR in the Thalamus (beta=-0.51, p=0.021) and Corpus Callosum (beta=-0.24, p=0.033) were predictive of cognitive impairment. DTI-FA in the Caudate (beta=-26.93, p=0.006) presented abnormal predictive result.; Conclusion: Lower myelin content by C-11-PIB uptake was associated with worse cognitive status. MTR was predictive of cognitive impairment in MS.

N2  -  PURPOSE
Cigarette smoking has been associated with increased occurrence of multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as clinical disability and disease progression in MS. We aimed to assess the effects of smoking on the white matter (WM) in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) using diffusion tensor imaging.; METHODS; Smoker patients with CIS (n=16), smoker healthy controls (n=13), nonsmoker patients with CIS (n=17) and nonsmoker healthy controls (n=14) were included. Thirteen regions-of-interest including nonenhancing T1 hypointense lesion and perilesional WM, and 11 normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions were drawn on color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Lesion load was determined in terms of number and volume of WM hyperintensities.; RESULTS; A tendency towards greater lesion load was found in smoker patients. T1 hypointense lesions and perilesional WM had reduced FA and increased mean diffusivity to a similar degree in smoker and nonsmoker CIS patients. Compared with healthy smokers, smoker CIS patients had more extensive NAWM changes shown by increased mean diffusivity. There was no relationship between diffusion metrics and clinical disability scores, duration of the disease and degree of smoking exposure.; CONCLUSION; Smoker patients showed a tendency towards having greater number of WM lesions and displayed significantly more extensive NAWM abnormalities.

N2  -  Neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) is a rare event that occurs in approximately one in 5000 term or close-to-term infants. Most affected infants will present with seizures. Although a well-recognized clinical entity, many questions remain regarding diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and follow-up modalities. In the absence of a known pathophysiological mechanism and lack of evidence-based guidelines, only supportive care is currently provided. To address these issues, a French national committee set up by the French Neonatal Society (Societe francaise de neonatologie) and the national referral center (Centre national de reference) for arterial ischemic stroke in children drew up guidelines based on an HAS (Haute Autorite de sante [HAS]; French national authority for health) methodology. The main findings and recommendations established by the study group are: (1) among the risk factors, male sex, primiparity, caesarean section, perinatal hypoxia, and fetal/neonatal infection (mainly bacterial meningitis) seem to be the most frequent. As for guidelines, the study group recommends the following: (1) the transfer of neonates with suspected NAIS to a neonatal intensive care unit with available equipment to establish a reliable diagnosis with MRI imaging and neurophysiological monitoring, preferably by continuous video EEG; (2) acute treatment of suspected infection or other life-threatening processes should be addressed immediately by the primary medical team. Persistent seizures should be treated with a loading dose of phenobarbital 20 mg/kg i.v.; (3) MRI of the brain is considered optimal for the diagnosis of NAIS. Diffusion weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient is considered the most sensitive measure for identifying infarct in the neonatal brain. The location and extent of the lesions are best assessed between 2 and 4 days after the onset of stroke; (4) routine testing for thrombophilia (AT, PC PS deficiency, FV Leiden or FII20210A) or for detecting other biological risk factors such as antiphospholipid antibodies, high FVIII, homocysteinemia, the Lp(a) test, the MTHFR thermolabile variant should not be considered in neonates with NAIS Testing for FV Leiden can be performed only in case of a documented family history of venous thromboembolic disease. Testing neonates for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered only in case of clinical events arguing in favor of antiphospholipid syndrome in the mother; (5) unlike childhood arterial ischemic stroke, NAIS has a low 5-year recurrence rate (approximately 1 %), except in those children with congenital heart disease or multiple genetic thrombophilia. Therefore, initiation of anticoagulation or antithrombotic agents, including heparin products, is not recommended in the newborn without identifiable risk factors; (6) the study group recommends that in case of delayed motor milestones or early handedness, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is recommended as early as possible. Newborns should have physical therapy evaluation and ongoing outpatient follow-up. Given the risk of later-onset cognitive, language, and behavioral disabilities, neuropsychological testing in preschool and at school age is highly recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion and diffusion-weighted MR imaging are powerful new imaging techniques for evaluating tissue pathophysiology in association with many neurologic disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging and diffusion-weighted MR imaging in cases of Alzheimer's disease and to assess the role of atrophy in the quantification of cortical perfusion.
METHODS: Thirty-nine participants were studied: 18 patients with moderate cognitive impairment with probable Alzheimer's disease, 16 patients with mild impairment with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease, and 15 group-matched elderly healthy comparison volunteers Relative values of temporoparietal, sensorimotor, and hippocampal regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were measured as a percentage of cerebellar rCBV, and group classification was assessed with logistic regression. Brain atrophy was used as a covariate to assess its role in rCBV quantification. Regions of interest placed on orientation-independence apparent diffusion coefficient maps allowed the calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient values and relative anisotropic indices of the head of the caudate nuclei, thalamus, parietal, frontal, and hippocampal cortices bilaterally, genu and splenium of corpus callosum, and anterior and posterior white matter in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in control volunteers.; RESULTS: Temporoparietal rCBV ratios were reduced bilaterally in the patients with Alzheimer's disease. Sensitivity was 91% in moderately affected patients with Alzheimer's disease and 90% in patients with mild cases. Specificity was 87% in healthy comparison volunteers. Lower values of sensitivity and specificity were obtained for sensorimotor (73%, 50%, and 67%, respectively) and hippocampal cortices (80%, 80%, and 65%, respectively). Using brain atrophy as a covariate, patients with Alzheimer's disease still showed a statistically significant reduction of rCBV compared with control volunteers. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging analysis only showed a trend, with no statistic significance, of reduction of anisotropy in posterior white matter.; CONCLUSION: Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging of rCBV may be an alternative to nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation of patients with Alzheimer's disease. When brain atrophy is used as a covariate, differences in rCBV still persist between patients with Alzheimer's disease and control volunteers, suggesting that perfusion impairment is unrelated to atrophy. No significant results for either white or gray matter were obtained using diffusion-weighted MR imaging.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Intracranial epidermoid cysts are congenital epidermal inclusion cysts derived from ectodermal origin with desquamated skin. The majority of these cysts occur in the cerebellopontine angle cistern. Epidermoid cyst of the pituitary stalk, however, is a rare location. To date, only 4 previous cases have been reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old male presented to our clinic with migraine headaches, dizziness, increased thirst, increased urinary frequency, and impotence. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a rim-enhancing cystic mass with diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging located within the pituitary stalk. The patient underwent a pretemporal approach with gross total resection of the cyst. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful with no new deficits andor endocrinopathies.; CONCLUSION: Epidermoid cyst of the pituitary stalk is an unusual and rare presentation. Four other cases treated via endoscopic approaches have been previously reported in the neurosurgical literature. To our knowledge this is the first case description of an infundibular epidermoid cyst pressing with isolated diabetes insipidus surgically treated via a transcranial pretemporal approach with gross total resection. The patient had a smooth and uneventful post-operative course with persistent diabetes insipidus.

N2  -  The gyral morphology of the region of the primary auditory cortex (PAC) in the human brain is highly variable. and possible asymmetries between the hemispheres have been noted since the beginning of the century. We mapped the location and extent of PAC as identified from gross anatomical landmarks in magnetic resonance scans that had been transformed into Talairach-Tournoux stereotaxic space. Individual maps were averaged to produce a probabilistic map of the region which can be co-registered with any image of brain structure or function that has been similarly transformed. The map can be used to localize a region of interest, such as a lesion, or an activation focus from positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging, within a specified range of probability. We also measured the total volume of the region and found a significant L > R asymmetry both on average and in the majority of subjects. Automatic segmentation of the volumes into grey and white matter revealed larger volumes of white, but not grey matter on the left. This larger volume of cortical connecting fibres may be related to the known left-hemisphere dominance for speech, and a preferential role for left PAC in processing temporal aspects of auditory stimuli is suggested.

N2  -  Primary spinal astrocytoma is a subtype of glioma, the most common spinal cord tumor found in the intradural intramedullary compartment. Spinal astrocytomas account for 6-8% of all spinal cord tumors and are primarily low grade (World Health Organization grade I (WHO I) or WHO II). They are seen in both the adult and pediatric population with the most common presenting symptoms being back pain, sensory dysfunction, or motor dysfunction. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium is the imaging of choice, which usually reveals a hypointense T1 weighted and hyperintense T2 weighted lesion with a heterogeneous pattern of contrast enhancement. Further imaging which may aid in surgical planning includes computerized tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and tractography. Median survival in spinal cord astrocytomas ranges widely. The factors most significantly associated with poor prognosis and shorter median survival are older age at initial diagnosis, higher grade lesion based on histology, and extent of resection. The mainstay of treatment for primary spinal cord astrocytomas is surgical resection, with the goal of preservation of neurologic function, guided by intraoperative neuromonitoring. Adjunctive radiation has been shown beneficial and may increase overall survival. The role of adjunctive chemotherapy is employed, however, its benefit has not been clearly defined. Primary spinal cord astrocytomas are rare and challenging to treat. The gold standard treatment is surgical resection. Second-line treatments include radiation and chemotherapy, although, the optimal regimen for adjunctive therapy has not yet been clearly defined.

N2  -  Accurate detection of early tumor margin is of great preclinical and clinical implications for predicting the survival rate of subjects and assessing the response of tumor microenvironment to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Here, we report a multimodality optical imaging study on in vivo detection of tumor boundary by analyzing neoangiogenesis of tumor microenvironment (microangiography), microcirculatory blood flow (optical Doppler tomography) and tumor proliferation (green fluorescent protein [GFP] fluorescence). Microangiography demonstrates superior sensitivity (77.7 +/- 6.4%) and specificity (98.2 +/- 1.7%) over other imaging technologies (eg, optical coherence tomography) for tumor margin detection. Additionally, we report longitudinal in vivo imaging of tumor progression and show that the abrupt tumor cell proliferation did not occur until local capillary density and cerebral blood flow reached their peak approximately 2 weeks after tumor implantation. The unique capability of longitudinal multimodality imaging of tumor angiogenesis may provide new insights in tumor biology and in vivo assessment of the treatment effects on anti-angiogenesis therapy for brain cancer.

N2  -  Recent multiple sclerosis (MS) MRI research has highlighted the need to move beyond the lesion-centric view and to develop and validate new MR imaging strategies that quantify the invisible burden of disease in the brain and establish much more sensitive and specific surrogate markers of clinical disability. One of the most promising of such measures is myelin-selective MRI that allows the acquisition of myelin water fraction (MWF) maps, a parameter that is correlated to brain white matter (WM) myelination. The aim of our study was to apply the newest myelin-selective MRI method, multi-component Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in a controlled clinical MS pilot trial. This study was designed to assess the capabilities of this new method to explain differences in disease course and degree of disability in subjects spanning a broad spectrum of MS disease severity. The whole-brain isotropically-resolved 3D acquisition capability of mcDESPOT allowed for the first time the registration of 3D MWF maps to standard space, and consequently a formalized voxel-based analysis of the data. This approach combined with image segmentation further allowed the derivation of new measures of MWF deficiency: total deficient MWF volume (DV) in WM, in WM lesions, in diffusely abnormal white matter and in normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Deficient MWF volume fraction (DVF) was derived from each of these by dividing by the corresponding region volume. Our results confirm that lesion burden does not correlate well with clinical disease activity measured with the extended disability status scale (EDSS) in MS patients. In contrast, our measurements of DVF in NAWM correlated significantly with the EDSS score (R-2=0.37; p < 0.001). The same quantity discriminated clinically isolated syndrome patients from a normal control population (p < 0.001) and discriminated relapsing-remitting from secondary-progressive patients (p < 0.05); hence this new technique may sense early disease-related myelin loss and transitions to progressive disease. Multivariate analysis revealed that global atrophy, mean whole-brain myelin water fraction and white matter atrophy were the three most important image-derived parameters for predicting clinical disability (EDSS). Overall, our results demonstrate that mcDESPOT-defined measurements in NAWM show great promise as imaging markers of global clinical disease activity in MS. Further investigation will determine if this measure can serve as a risk factor for the conversion into definite MS and for the secondary transition into irreversible disease progression.

N2  -  ObjectiveThe present study aimed to identify the brain regions involved in upper and lower limb motor and functional recovery after stroke.MethodsTwenty-five patients (mean age 73.4 years; average duration from stroke onset 50.1 months) were examined. Fractional anisotropy (FA) mapping using diffusion tensor imaging, and clinical measures, including the Fugl-Meyer motor assessment of upper and lower limbs, the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Functional Ambulation Category, were used for examinations. Linear regression analyses were carried out with the FA map as a dependent variable, each clinical measure as an independent variable, and patient age as a covariate.ResultsFA in the internal capsule of the posterior limb of the lesioned hemisphere was significantly associated with Fugl-Meyer motor assessment scores for the upper limbs, whereas FAs in the internal capsule of the posterior limb of the lesioned hemisphere, the posterior corpus callosum of the lesioned hemisphere, and the middle cerebellar peduncle of the contralateral hemisphere were associated with Fugl-Meyer motor assessment scores for the lower limb. FA in brain regions with bilateral connection fibers was commonly associated with the score on the Korean version of the MBI and participants' functional ambulation. Furthermore, the FA in the corticospinal tract in the contralesional hemisphere was also associated with the score on the Korean version of the MBI (corrected P<0.05).ConclusionMotor and functional recovery of upper and lower limbs involves different brain regions. This finding is of particular relevance for treatment and recovery in stroke.

N2  -  Purpose: Amino acid PET has shown high accuracy for the diagnosis and prognostication of malignant gliomas, however, this imaging modality is not widely available in clinical practice. This study explores a novel end-to-end deep learning framework ("U-Net") for its feasibility to detect high amino acid uptake glioblastoma regions (i.e., metabolic tumor volume) using clinical multimodal MRI sequences. Methods: T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), apparent diffusion coefficient map, contrast-enhanced T1, and alpha-[C-11]-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT)-PET images were analyzed in 21 patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. U-Net system with data augmentation was implemented to deeply learn non-linear voxel-wise relationships between intensities of multimodal MRI as the input and metabolic tumor volume from AMT-PET as the output. The accuracy of the MRI- and PET-based volume measures to predict progression-free survival was tested. Results: In the augmented dataset using all four MRI modalities to investigate the upper limit of U-Net accuracy in the full study cohort, U-Net achieved high accuracy (sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value [PPV]/negative predictive value [NPV]: 0.85/1.00/0.81/1.00, respectively) to predict PET-defined tumor volumes. Exclusion of FLAIR from the MRI input set had a strong negative effect on sensitivity (0.60). In repeated hold out validation in randomly selected subjects, specificity and NPV remained high (1.00), but mean sensitivity (0.62), and PPV (0.68) were moderate. AMT-PET-learned MRI tumor volume from this U-net model within the contrast-enhancing volume predicted 6-month progression-free survival with 0.86/0.63 sensitivity/specificity. Conclusions: These data indicate the feasibility of PET-based deep learning for enhanced pretreatment glioblastoma delineation and prognostication by clinical multimodal MRI.

N2  -  Objective
To assess whether hippocampal sclerosis (HS) severity is mirrored at the level of large-scale networks.; Methods; We studied preoperative high-resolution anatomical and diffusion-weighted MRI of 44 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with histopathologic diagnosis of HS (n = 25; TLE-HS) and isolated gliosis (n = 19; TLE-G) and 25 healthy controls. Hippocampal measurements included surface-based subfield mapping of atrophy and T2 hyperintensity indexing cell loss and gliosis, respectively. Whole-brain connectomes were generated via diffusion tractography and examined using graph theory along with a novel network control theory paradigm that simulates functional dynamics from structural network data.; Results; Compared to controls, we observed markedly increased path length and decreased clustering in TLE-HS compared to controls, indicating lower global and local network efficiency, while TLE-G showed only subtle alterations. Similarly, network controllability was lower in TLE-HS only, suggesting limited range of functional dynamics. Hippocampal imaging markers were positively associated with macroscale network alterations, particularly in ipsilateral CA1-3. Systematic assessment across several networks revealed maximal changes in the hippocampal circuity. Findings were consistent when correcting for cortical thickness, suggesting independence from gray matter atrophy.; Conclusions; Severe HS is associated with marked remodeling of connectome topology and structurally governed functional dynamics in TLE, as opposed to isolated gliosis, which has negligible effects. Cell loss, particularly in CA1-3, may exert a cascading effect on brain-wide connectomes, underlining coupled disease processes across multiple scales.

N2  -  Since ADC reduction reflects intracellular edema which is an early indicator of ischemic cellular metabolic stress, we hypothesized that a decrease in ADC as determined by diffusion weighted MR imaging could be attenuated by SOD expression in transgenic mice during reperfusion following focal cerebral ischemia. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed to evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) reduction by constructing ADC maps with a color scale to localize ADC change in transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and wild type (Wt) mice during 1 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 1 h reperfusion. Heat shock. protein (hsp) 70-kDa mRNA analysis was evaluated as a marker of sublethal cell stress by in situ hybridization after 4 h reperfusion for comparison with Nissl staining of adjacent sections to assess infarction. Sequential ADC maps were prepared in Tg mice with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to permit comparison with Wt mice. Tg mice showed substantial recovery of the ADC lesion after reperfusion, while Wt mice showed no recovery. There was no difference between Tg and Wt mice in the size or distribution of the ADC lesion during ischemia. The area with strong expression of hsp70 mRNA in the ischemic hemisphere was substantially larger in the Tg mice. Nissl staining showed less damage of brain tissue in Tg mice than Wt mice especially in the cortex after 4 h reperfusion following 1 h MCAO. Results demonstrate that antioxidant effects of human CuZn-SOD reduce cellular edema due to oxidative stress during reperfusion but not during ischemia after I h MCAO. Hsp70 could be one of the proteins that mediates protection by SOD against oxidative stress. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose: Differentiating glioblastoma from brain metastases is important for therapy planning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was described as a promising tool, however with conflicting results.
Aim: of this study was to analyze the clinical utility of DTI for the differentiation of brain metastases and glioblastoma.; Methods: 294 patients (165 glioblastoma, 129 brain metastases) with preoperative DTI were included in this retrospective study. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured via regions of interest (ROIs) in the contrast-enhancing tumor, the necrosis and the FLAIR-hyperintense non-enhancing peritumoral region (NEPTR). Two neuroradiologists classified patient cases as glioblastoma or brain metastases without and with knowledge of FA values.; Results: Glioblastoma showed significantly higher FA(contrast) (median glioblastoma = 0.33, metastases = 0.23; P < 0.001) whereas no significant difference was observed for FA(NEPTR) (0.21 vs. 0.22; P = 0.28) and for FA(necrosis) (0.17 vs. 0.18, P = 0.37). FA improved diagnostic accuracy of the neuroradiologists significantly from an AUC of 0.840.85 (Reader1Reader2) to 0.890.92.; Conclusions: Glioblastoma show significantly higher FA values in the contrast enhancing tumor part than brain metastases. Implementation of a ROI-based measurement of FA values and FA color maps in clinical routine helps to differentiate between glioblastoma and brain metastases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Object. The integration of state-of-the-art neuroimaging into treatment planning may increase the therapeutic potential of stereotactic radiosurgery. Functional neuroimaging, including functional MRI, navigated brain stimulation, and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography, may guide the orientation of radiation beams to decrease the dose to critical cortical and subcortical areas. The authors describe their method of integrating functional neuroimaging technology into radiosurgical treatment planning using the CyberKnife radiosurgery system.
Methods. The records of all patients who had undergone radiosurgery for brain lesions at the CyberKnife Center of the University of Messina, Italy, between July 2010 and July 2012 were analyzed. Among patients with brain lesions in critical areas, treatment planning with the integration of functional neuroimaging was performed in 25 patients. Morphological and functional imaging data sets were coregistered using the Multiplan dedicated treatment planning system. Treatment planning was initially based on morphological data; radiation dose distribution was then corrected in relation to the functionally relevant cortical and subcortical areas. The change in radiation dose distribution was then calculated.; Results. The data sets could be easily and reliably integrated into the Cyberknife treatment planning. Using an inverse planning algorithm, the authors achieved an average 17% reduction in the radiation dose to functional areas. Further gain in terms of dose sparing compromised other important treatment parameters, including target coverage, conformality index, and number of monitor units. No neurological deficit due to radiation was recorded at the short-term follow-up.; Conclusions. Radiosurgery treatments rely on the quality of neuroimaging. The integration of functional data allows a reduction in radiation doses to functional organs at risk, including critical cortical areas, subcortical tracts, and vascular structures. The relative simplicity of integrating functional neuroimaging into radiosurgery warrants further research to implement, standardize, and identify the limits of this procedure.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of functional neuronavigation in surgeries of adult cerebral gliomas.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 375 cases of adult cerebral glioma patients who underwent microsurgical treatment between 2011 and 2017 in our department. Among them, 142 patients underwent surgery using functional neuronavigation (group A), and the other 233 patients were operated on without the help of functional neuronavigation (group B). For both groups, we categorized them into several subgroups according to the lesion locations.; RESULTS: A significant difference in the gross total resection rate was observed between group A and group B (P = 0.001 for overall; P = 0.036 for EO area; and P = 0.004 for BBT area). The postoperative complication rate of group A was much lower than that of group B (P = 0.003 for overall; and P = 0.016 for BBT area). The postoperative 6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of all patients in group A was significantly higher than that of group B. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed significant increases in the median survival time of group A compared with that of group B (P< 0.001 for overall; P = 0.012 for EO area; P = 0.006 for BBT area), and the Cox proportional regression analysis estimated the hazard ratio of the functional neuronavigation to be 0.533, helping reduce the risk of death by 46.7%.; CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the application of neuronavigation in adult glioma surgery can improve postoperative quality of life and lengthen the survival time of patients, especially in cases involving the brainstem and the eloquent area.

N2  -  Background and purpose: Virtual magnetic resonance elastography (vMRE) is an experimental imaging modality designed to non-invasively predict the haptic properties of tissues. The modality is sensitive to tissue stiffness and fibrosis. Information about meningioma consistency prior to resection is of great interest in neurological surgery as the surgical plan and outcome may be affected by the tumor's stiffness. In this study, we assessed the ability of vMRE to predict the intraoperative consistency and mechanical heterogeneity of intracranial meningiomas. Materials and methods: We included 12 patients scheduled for meningioma resection, of which one patient was found to have a solitary fibrous tumor on histological examination. All participants underwent preoperative vMRE and intraoperative consistency grading. Results and Conclusions: Intraoperative qualitative consistency correlated positively with vMRE-based consistency assessment (odds ratio 5.63, 95% CI 1.12-28.30, p = 0.04) at b1000. Mechanically homogenous tumors had significantly lower Delta mean stiffness than heterogeneous tumors (8.13 vs 18.07 kPa, p = 0.01). This study thus demonstrates a possible clinical application of vMRE in predicting the intraoperative consistency and mechanical heterogeneity of meningiomas. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

N2  -  Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) may represent a valuable tool in the early diagnosis of spinal cord diseases. The purpose of this paper was to test the feasibility of a single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE) DWI in normal and abnormal spinal cord, and to evaluate its use in routine clinical imaging. We used a SSFSE sensitive to diffusion (b = 600 s/mm(2)) with multi-slice or single slice technique to study normal (32 cases) or abnormal (39 cases) spinal cords. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated. Single slice sequences were significantly more reliable than multi-Slice sequences for measurement of ADC. In normal subjects, mean ADC values were remarkably similar at both cervical and thoracic levels. Increased ADC values were detected in patients with cord trauma, myelitis, dural malformation, glioma, syringomyelia or metastasis, whereas decreased ADC values were detected in a patient with cervical intraspinal metastasis. This is the first report of the feasibility of a single slice SSFSE diffusion sequence for routine spinal cord imaging. The measurement of ADC may be of diagnostic value for the insight it offers on the pathophysiology of parenchymal damage.

N2  -  Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI provide information about differences in macro-and microvasculature when executed with gradient-echo (GE; sensitive to macrovasculature) and spin-echo (SE; sensitive to microvasculature) contrast. This study investigated whether there are differences between macro- and microvascular transit time heterogeneity (MVTH and mu VTH) and tissue oxygen tension (PO2(mit)) in newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. Fifty-seven patients with glioblastoma (25 newly-diagnosed/32 recurrent) were examined with GE-and SE-DSC perfusion sequences, and a quantitative blood-oxygen-level-dependent (qBOLD) approach. Maps of MVTH, mVTH and coefficient of variation (MCOV and mCOV) were calculated from GE-and SE- DSC data, respectively, using an extended flow-diffusion equation. PO(2)mit maps were calculated from qBOLD data. Newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma showed significantly lower (P <= 0.001) mCOV values compared to both normal brain and macrovasculature (MCOV) of the lesions. Recurrent glioblastoma had significantly higher mVTH (P = 0.014) and mCOV (P = 0.039) as well as significantly lower PO2(mit) values (P = 0.008) compared to newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. The macrovasculature, however, showed no significant differences. Our findings provide evidence of microvascular adaption in the disorganized tumor vasculature for retaining the metabolic demands in stress response of therapeutically-uncontrolled glioblastomas. Thus, mVTH and PO2(mit) mapping gives insight into the tumor microenvironment (vascular and hypoxic niches) responsible for therapy resistance.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE. Recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) arises from areas of microscopic tumor infiltration that have yet to disrupt the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesize that these microscopic foci of invasion cause subtle variations in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and FLAIR signal detectable with the use of computational big-data modeling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twenty-six patients with native GBM were studied immediately after undergoing gross total tumor resection. Within the peritumoral region, areas of future GBM recurrence were identified through coregistration of follow-up MRI examinations. The likelihood of tumor recurrence at each individual voxel was assessed as a function of signal intensity on ADC maps and FLAIR images. Both single and combined multivariable logistic regression models were created.; RESULTS. A total of 419,473 voxels of data (105,477 voxels of data within tumor recurrence and 313,996 voxels of data on surrounding peritumoral edema) were analyzed. For future areas of recurrence, a 9.5% decrease in the ADC value (p < 0.001) and a 9.2% decrease in signal intensity on FLAIR images (p < 0.001) were shown, compared with findings for the surrounding peritumoral edema. Logistic regression revealed that the amount of signal loss on both ADC maps and FLAIR images correlated with the likelihood of tumor recurrence. A combined multiparametric logistic regression model was more specific in the prediction of tumor recurrence than was either single-variable model alone.; CONCLUSION. Areas of future GBM recurrence exhibit small but highly statistically significant differences in signal intensity on ADC maps and FLAIR images months before the development of abnormal enhancement occurs. A multiparametric logistic model calibrated to these changes can be used to estimate the burden of microscopic nonenhancing tumor and predict the location of recurrent disease. Computational big-data modeling performed at the voxel level is a powerful technique capable of discovering important but subtle patterns in imaging data.

N2  -  The goal of glioma surgery is maximal safe resection. These intrinsic brain neoplasms, however, lack a clear margin and frequently infiltrate eloquent areas of the brain thus making their surgical resection challenging. This review first focuses on discussion of preoperative investigations that aid in anatomical and functional tumor characterization that help define tumor extent and determine the feasibility of complete resection. The second part of this review outlines intraoperative adjuncts that help identify tumor infiltrated tissues during surgery to maximize the extent of resection. In addition, we discuss the principles of intraoperative functional cortical and subcortical mapping and monitoring that enable maximal tumor resection while minimizing the risk of postoperative neurological deficit. Combined use of different modalities before and during surgery is encouraged to meet surgical goals and to ensure best patient outcome.

N2  -  Objective: We examined imaging surrogates of white matter microstructural abnormalities which may precede white matter lesions (WML) and represent a relevant marker of cerebrovascular injury in adults in midlife.
Methods: In 698 community-dwelling adults (mean age 50 years +- 3.5 SD) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study, WML were identified on structural MR and fractional anisotropy (FA), representing WM microstructural integrity, was derived using Diffusion Tensor Imaging. FA and WML maps were overlaid on a parcellated T1-template, based on an expert-delineated brain atlas, which included 42 WM tract ROIs. Analyses occurred in stages: 1) WML were quantified for the different tracts (i.e., frequency, volume, volume relative to tract size); 2) the interdependence of FA in normal appearing WM (NAWM) and WML was examined across tracts; 3) associations of NAWM FA and hypertension status were assessed controlling for WML volume. In the latter analysis, both overall hypertension (i.e. hypertension vs. normotension and prehypertension vs. normotension) and hypertension categorized by antihypertensive treatment status (yesno) and blood pressure control (e.g., diastolic < 90 mmHg, systolic < 140 mmHg), were assessed.; Results: WML were widely distributed across different WM tracts, however, WML volume was small. Mean NAWM FA was lower in participants with vs. participants without WML in given tracts. Hypertension was significantly associated with lower mean NAWM FA globally across tracts, both before and after adjustment for WML volume. Moreover, the magnitude of this association differed by treatment status and the level of control of the hypertension.; Conclusions: In middle-aged adults, NAWM FA could represent a relevant marker of cerebrovascular injury when WML are minimally present.

N2  -  Repeated kindled seizures induce long-lasting physiological and morphological alterations in the hippocampal formation. In the dentate gyrus (DG), the morphological alterations induced by kindled seizures include loss of polymorphic neurons in the hilus, messy fiber axon sprouting, and synaptic reorganization of the messy fiber pathway. In this study, quantitative stereological methods were used to determine the distribution and time course of neuronal loss induced by 3, 30, or 150 kindled generalized tonic-clonic seizures in hippocampal, limbic, and neocortical pathways. Neuronal loss was observed in the hilus of the DG and CA1 after three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and progressed in these sites to 49% and 44% of controls after 150 seizures. Neuronal loss was also observed in CA3, entorhinal cortex, and the rostral endopyriform nucleus after 30 seizures, and was detected in the granule cell layer and CA2 after 150 seizures. There was no evidence of neuronal loss in the somatosensory cortex after 150 seizures, The time course of the neuronal loss demonstrated selective vulnerability of hippocampal neuronal populations to seizure-induced injury, and suggests that even brief seizures may induce excitotoxic injury in vulnerable neuronal populations. Repeated brief seizures induced neuronal loss in a distribution that resembled hippocampal sclerosis, the most common lesion observed in human epilepsy. The results demonstrated that kindling induces alterations in neural circuitry in a variety of locations in the limbic system, and suggest that hippocampal sclerosis may be acquired in human epilepsy as a consequence of repeated seizures.

N2  -  Connectomics generates comprehensive maps of brain networks, represented as nodes and their pairwise connections. The functional roles of nodes are defined by their direct and indirect connectivity with the rest of the network. However, the network context is not directly accessible at the level of individual nodes. Similar problems in language processing have been addressed with algorithms such as word2vec that create embeddings of words and their relations in a meaningful low-dimensional vector space. Here we apply this approach to create embedded vector representations of brain networks or connectome embeddings (CE). CE can characterize correspondence relations among brain regions, and can be used to infer links that are lacking from the original structural diffusion imaging, e.g., inter-hemispheric homotopic connections. Moreover, we construct predictive deep models of functional and structural connectivity, and simulate network-wide lesion effects using the face processing system as our application domain. We suggest that CE offers a novel approach to revealing relations between connectome structure and function.

N2  -  Background: Scientific research is typically performed by expert individuals or groups who investigate potential solutions in a sequential manner. Given the current worldwide exponential increase in technical innovations, potential solutions for any new problem might already exist, even though they were developed to solve a different problem. Therefore, in crowdsourcing ideation, a research question is explained to a much larger group of individuals beyond the specialist community to obtain a multitude of diverse, outside-the-box solutions. These are then assessed in parallel by a group of experts for their capacity to solve the new problem. The 2 key problems in brain tumor surgery are the difficulty of discerning the exact border between a tumor and the surrounding brain, and the difficulty of identifying the function of a specific area of the brain. Both problems could be solved by a method that visualizes the highly organized fiber tracts within the brain; the absence of fibers would reveal the tumor, whereas the spatial orientation of the tracts would reveal the area's function. To raise awareness about our challenge of developing a means of intraoperative, real-time, noninvasive identification of fiber tracts and tumor borders to improve neurosurgical oncology, we
Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a crowdsourcing ideation campaign for finding novel solutions to challenges in neuroscience. The purpose of this paper is to introduce our chosen crowdsourcing method and discuss it in the context of the current literature.; Methods: We ran a prize-based crowdsourcing ideation competition called HORAO on the commercial platform HeroX. Prize money previously collected through a crowdfunding campaign was offered as an incentive. Using a multistage approach, an expert jury first selected promising technical solutions based on broad, predefined criteria, coached the respective solvers in the second stage, and finally selected the winners in a conference setting. We performed a postchallenge web-based survey among the solvers crowd to find out about their backgrounds and demographics.; Results: Our web-based campaign reached more than 20,000 people (views). We received 45 proposals from 32 individuals and 7 teams, working in 26 countries on 4 continents. The postchallenge survey revealed that most of the submissions came from single solvers or teams working in engineering or the natural sciences, with additional submissions from other nonmedical fields. We engaged in further exchanges with 3 out of the 5 finalists and finally initiated a successful scientific collaboration with the winner of the challenge.; Conclusions: This open innovation competition is the first of its kind in medical technology research. A prize-based crowdsourcing ideation campaign is a promising strategy for raising awareness about a specific problem, finding innovative solutions, and establishing new scientific collaborations beyond strictly disciplinary domains.

N2  -  Stroke lesion-volume estimates derived from calculated water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provide a quantitative surrogate end-point for investigating the efficacy of drug treatment or studying the temporal evolution of cerebral ischemia. Methodology is described for estimating ischemic lesion volumes in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) based on absolute and percent-reduction threshold values of the water ADC at 3 h post-MCAO. Volume estimates derived from average ADC (ADC(av)) maps were compared with those derived from post-mortem histological sections. Optimum ADC thresholds were established as those that provided the best correlation and one-to-one correspondence between ADC- and histologically derived lesion-volume estimates. At 3 h post-MCAO, an absolute-ADC(av), threshold of 47 x 10(-1) mm(2)/s (corresponding to a 33% reduction in ADC(av), based on a contralateral hemisphere comparison) provided the most accurate estimate of percent hemispheric lesion volume (%HLV). Experimental and data analysis issues for improving and validating the usefulness of DWI as a surrogate endpoint for the quantification of ischemic lesion volume are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Object. A growing number of published studies have recently demonstrated the role of resection in overall survival (OS) for patients with gliomas. In this retrospective study, the authors objectively investigated the role of the extent of resection (EOR) in OS in patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs).
Methods. Between 1998 and 2011, 190 patients underwent surgery for LGGs. All surgical procedures were conducted under corticosubcortical stimulation. The EOR was established by analyzing the pre- and postoperative volumes of the gliomas on T2-weighted MRI studies. The difference between the preoperative tumor volumes was also investigated by measuring the volumetric difference between the T2- and T1-weighted MRI images (Delta VT2T1) to evaluate how the diffusive tumor-growing pattern affected the EOR achieved.; Results. The median preoperative tumor volume was 55 cm(3), and in almost half of the patients the EOR was greater than 90%. In this study, patients with an EOR of 90% or greater had an estimated 5-year OS rate of 93%, those with EOR between 70% and 89% had a 5-year OS rate of 84%, and those with EOR less than 70% had a 5-year OS rate of 41% (p < 0.001). New postoperative deficits were noted in 43.7% of cases, while permanent deficits occurred in 3.16% of cases. There were 41 deaths (21.6%), and the median follow-up was 4.7 years.; A further volumetric analysis was also conducted to compare 2 different intraoperative protocols (Series I intraoperative electrical stimulation alone vs Series 2 intraoperative stimulation plus overlap of functional MRIfiber tracking diffusion tensor imaging data on a neuronavigation system). Patients in Series I had a median EOR of 77%, while those in Series 2 had a median EOR of 90% (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that OS is influenced not only by EOR (p = 0.001) but also by age (p = 0.003), histological subtype (p = 0.005), and the Delta VT2T1 value (p < 0.0001). Progression-free survival is similarly influenced by histological subtype (fibrillary astrocytoma, p = 0.003), EOR (p < 0.0001), and Delta VT2T1 value (p < 0.0001), as is malignant progression free survival (p = 0.003, p < 0.0001, and p <0.0001, respectively). Finally, the study shows that the higher the Delta VT2T1 value, the less extensive the currently possible resection, highlighting an apparent correlation between the Delta VT2T1 value itself and EOR (p <0.0001).; Conclusions. The EOR and the Delta VT2T1 values are the strongest independent predictors in improving OS as well as in delaying tumor progression and malignant transformation. Furthermore, the Delta VT2T1 value may be useful as a predictive index for EOR. Finally, due to intraoperative corticosubcortical mapping and the overlap of functional data on the neuronavigation system, major resection is possible with an acceptable risk and a significant increase in expected OS.

N2  -  In subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS), pathology is more frequent near the inner and outer surfaces of the brain. Here, we sought to explore if in subjects with primary progressive MS (PPMS) cortical lesion load is selectively associated with the severity of periventricular normal appearing white matter (NAWM) damage, as assessed with diffusion weighted imaging.
To this aim, twenty-four subjects with PPMS and twenty healthy controls were included in the study. Using diffusion data, skeletonized mean diffusivity (MD) NAWM maps were computed excluding WM lesions and a 2 mm-thick peri-lesional rim. The supra-tentorial voxels between 2 and 6 mm of distance from the lateral ventricles were included in the periventricular NAWM mask while the voxels between 6 and 10 mm from the lateral ventricles were included in the deep NAWM mask; mean MD values were then computed separately for these two masks. Lastly, cortical lesions were assessed on phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) images and cortical thickness was quantified on volumetric T1 images.; Our main result was the observation in the PPMS group of a significant correlation between periventricular NAWM MD values and cortical lesion load, with a greater cortical lesion burden being associated with more abnormal periventricular NAWM MD. Conversely, there was no correlation between cortical lesion load and deep NAWM MD values or periventricular WM lesions.; Our data thus suggest that a common - and relatively selective - factor plays a role in the development of both cortical lesion and periventricular NAWM abnormalities in PPMS.

N2  -  Objective To characterise, using conventional and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI, the nature and distribution of lesions and the extent of damage in the brain normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and grey matter (GM) from a relatively large population of paediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Methods Brain conventional and DT MRI scans were acquired from 48 patients with paediatric MS (10 clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), 38 relapsing remitting (RR) MS), 30 adult CIS, 27 adult RRMS, 15 paediatric healthy controls (HC) and 18 adult HC. T2-lesion probability maps and DT MRI of lesions, NAWM and GM were compared among controls and MS groups.; Results T2-visible lesion volumes did not differ among patient groups, but T2 lesions were more frequently located in the posterior periventricular regions in adult RRMS patients than in adult CIS and paediatric RRMS patients. Adult RRMS patients had a significantly higher lesion average mean diffusivity than paediatric RRMS patients. No DT MRI changes in the NA tissues were found in paediatric and adult CIS patients. DT MRI abnormalities were limited to the NAWM in paediatric RRMS patients, while they involved the NAWM and GM in adult RRMS patients. The extent of NAWM involvement was similar between adult and paediatric RRMS patients and was significantly correlated with T2-visible lesion burden.; Conclusions A less severe intrinsic lesion damage, a less frequent lesion occurrence in the posterior periventricular WM and the sparing of GM may help to explain the favourable short-medium-term disease outcome of paediatric MS.

N2  -  Background Preoperative differential diagnosis between primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma (GBM) is important because these tumors require different surgical strategies. This study investigated the usefulness of dual isotope, iodine-123-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodo-amphetamine (I-123-IMP) and thallium-201 chloride single-photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) for the differential diagnosis. Methods Twenty-five PCNSL patients and 27 GBM patients who underwent dual isotope imaging, I-123-IMP and Tl-201 SPECT, are included. Tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio was calculated from the ratio of maximum tracer counts in the lesion to the mean counts in the contralateral cerebral cortex. The mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficient values (ADC(mean) and ADC(min,) respectively) on magnetic resonance imaging were also analyzed. Results Delayed phase I-123-IMP SPECT was the most useful imaging examination for the differentiation between PCNSL and GBM compared with early phase I-123-IMP SPECT, early and delayed phase Tl-201 SPECT, ADC(mean), and ADC(min). However, the median T/N ratios of PCNSL and GBM were 1.32 and 0.83, respectively, in the delayed phase I-123-IMP SPECT. On the other hand, the median T/N ratios of PCNSL and GBM were 3.10 and 2.34, respectively, in the delayed phase Tl-201 SPECT, with excellent tumor detection. Conclusion Delayed phase I-123-IMP SPECT could differentiate between PCNSL and GBM with high accuracy, but T/N ratio was low and tumor detection was poor. Tl-201 SPECT was useful for estimation of the malignancy and localization of the tumors with high T/N ratio. Dual isotope I-123-IMP and Tl-201 SPECT was useful for the preoperative diagnosis of PCNSL and GBM.

N2  -  Background: Preoperatively acquired diffusion tensor image (DTI) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) have been proved to be effective in providing more anatomical and functional information; however, the brain deformation induced by brain shift and tumor resection severely impairs the correspondence between the image space and the patient space in image-guided neurosurgery.
Method: To address the brain deformation, we developed a hybrid non-rigid registration method to register high-field preoperative MRI with low-field intra-operative MRI in order to recover the deformation induced by brain shift and tumor resection. The registered DTI and BOLD are fused with low-field intra-operative MRI for image-guided neurosurgery.; Results: The proposed hybrid registration method was evaluated by comparing the landmarks predicted by the hybrid registration method with the landmarks identified in the low-field intra-operative MRI for 10 patients. The prediction error of the hybrid method is 1.92 +- 0.54 mm, and the compensation accuracy is 74.3 +- 5.0%. Compared to the landmarks far from the resection region, those near the resection region demonstrated a higher compensation accuracy (P-value = .003) although these landmarks had larger initial displacements.; Conclusions: The proposed hybrid registration method is able to bring preoperatively acquired BOLD and DTI into the operating room and compensate for the deformation to augment low-field intra-operative MRI with rich anatomical and functional information.

N2  -  The implementation of intraoperative augmented reality fiber tractography (iARFT) into the surgical workflow for high-grade supratentorial gliomas has been shown to be effective and safe in maximizing the extent of resection and progression-free survival through the surgeon's enhanced 3-dimensional awareness of the spatial localization of fiber tracts.1-3 Primary motor area tumors present special challenges due to the high eloquence of the precentral gyrus and risk of postoperative onset or worsening of motor deficits, as well as limited postoperative plasticity.4 Although essential, electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) techniques have a number of limitations with respect to primary motor pathways, including a higher risk of intraoperative stimulation-evoked seizures, a risk of false negatives in the presence of preoperative deficits, a nonnegligible risk of permanent deterioration even in the presence of negative stimulation maps, and, most importantly, limited spatial resolution.4-8 The rationale for integrating ESM and iAR-FT is to compensate for the limitations of the former in terms of morphologic and spatial representation of fiber tracts. The benefits of coupling iAR-FT with ESM techniques allow for continuous integrated anatomical-functional feedback during surgery. In Video 1 we describe the key technical aspects and benefits of iAR-FT-assisted surgery for maximal safe gross total resection of a primary motor area grade IV astrocytoma.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the correlation between electrical conductivity and sodium concentration, both measured in vivo, in the human brain.
Methods: Conductivity measurements were performed on samples with different sodium (Na+) and agarose concentrations using a dielectric probe, and the correlation between conductivity and Na+ content was evaluated. Subsequently, brain conductivity and total Na+ content maps were measured in 8 healthy subjects using phase-based MREPT and sodium MRI, respectively. After co-registration and spatial normalization to the 1 mm 152 MNI brain atlas, the relationship between conductivity and tissue sodium concentration (TSC) was examined within different brain regions.; Results: The conductivities of agarose gels increased linearly with NaCl concentration, while remaining almost independent of agarose content. When measured in healthy subjects, conductivities showed positive correlation with total tissue sodium concentration (R = 0.39, P < 0.005). The same trend was found in gray matter (R = 0.36, P < 0.005) and in white matter (R = 0.28, P < 0.05).; Conclusion: Tissue conductivity shows a positive correlation with total sodium concentration. Conductivity might serve as a novel technique to visualize the total tissue electrolyte concentration, although refinements in the consideration of e.g., tissue water content, would be necessary to improve the quantitative value.

N2  -  The present study aimed to explore the role of texture analysis with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps based on different regions of interest (ROI) in determining glioma grade. Thirty patients with glioma underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). ADC values were determined from the following three ROIs: i) whole tumor; ii) solid portion; and iii) peritumoral edema. Texture features were compared between high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and low-grade gliomas (LGGs) using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the unpaired Student's t-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the optimum threshold for inhomogeneity values in discrimination of HGGs from LGGs. With a spearman rank correlation model, the aforementioned ADC inhomogeneity values were correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index. With whole tumor ROI, inhomogeneity values proved to be significantly different between HGGs and LGGs (P< 0.001). With solid portion ROI, inhomogeneity and median values showed significant difference between HGGs and LGGs (P= 0.001 and P= 0.043, respectively). With peritumoral edema ROI, entropy and edema volume demonstrated positive results (P= 0.016, P< 0.001). The whole tumor inhomogeneity parameter performed with better diagnostic accuracy (P= 0.048) than selecting the solid portion ROI. The association between inhomogeneity and Ki-67 labeling index was significantly positive in whole tumor and solid portion ROI (R= 0.628, P< 0.001 and R= 0.470, P= 0.009). Texture analysis of DWI based on different ROI can provide various significant parameters to evaluate tumor heterogeneity, which were correlated with tumor grade. Particularly, the inhomogeneity value derived from whole tumor ROI provided high diagnostic value and predicting the status of tumor proliferation.

N2  -  Surgical management of deep-seated brain tumors requires precise functional navigation and minimally invasive surgery. Preoperative mapping using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS), intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), and minimally invasive parafascicular surgery (MIPS) act together in a functional-sparing approach. nTMS also provides a rehabilitation tool to maximize functional recovery. This is a single-center retrospective proof-of-concept cohort study between January 2022 and June 2023 of patients admitted for surgery with motor eloquent deep-seated brain tumors. The study enrolled seven adult patients, five females and two males, with a mean age of 56.28 years old. The lesions were located in the cingulate gyrus (three patients), the central core (two patients), and the basal ganglia (two patients). All patients had preoperative motor deficits. The most common histological diagnosis was metastasis (five patients). The MIPS approach to the mid-cingulate lesions involved a trajectory through the fronto-aslant tract (FAT) and the fronto-striatal tract (FST). No positive nTMS motor responses were resected as part of the outer corridor for MIPS. Direct cortical stimulation produced stable motor-evoked potentials during the surgeries with no warning signs. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in three patients and near-total resection (NTR) in four patients. Post-operatively, all patients had a deterioration of motor function with no ischemia in the postoperative imaging (cavity-to-CST distance 0-4 mm). After nTMS with low-frequency stimulation in the contralateral motor cortex, six patients recovered to their preoperative functional status and one patient improved to a better functional condition. A combined Tractography-MIPS-IONM-TMS approach provides a successful functional-sparing approach to deep-seated motor eloquent tumors and a rehabilitation framework for functional recovery after surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In fat embolism, free fatty acid is more toxic than neutral fat in terms of tissue damage. We evaluated the hyperacute embolic effects of triolein and oleic acid in cat brains by using MR imaging and electron microscopy.
METHODS: T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were performed in cat brains after the injection of triolein (group 1, n = 8) or oleic acid (group 2, n = 10) into the internal carotid artery. MR images were quantitatively assessed by comparing the signal intensity ratios of the lesions with their counterparts on T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Electron microscopic findings in group I were compared with those in group 2.; RESULTS: Qualitatively, MR images revealed two types of lesions. Type 1 lesions were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and hypointense on ADC maps. Type 2 lesions were isointense or mildly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and isointense on ADC maps. Quantitatively, the signal intensity ratios of type 1 lesions in group 2 specimens were significantly higher on T2-weighted images (P = .013)1(P = .027) and lower on ADC maps compared with those of group 1. Electron microscopy of type I lesions in both groups revealed more prominent widening of the perivascular space and swelling of the neural cells in group 2, in contrast to notable endothelial defects in group 1.; CONCLUSION. MR and electron microscopic data on cerebral fat embolism induced by either triolein or oleic acid revealed characteristics suggestive of both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in the hyperacute stage. Tissue damage appeared more severe in the oleic acid group than in the triolein group.

N2  -  The work is motivated by a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study of the differential tumour-healthy tissue change in contrast uptake induced by radiation. The goal is to determine the time in which there is maximal contrast uptake (a surrogate for permeability) in the tumour relative to healthy tissue. A notable feature of the data is its spatial heterogeneity. Zhang and co-workers have discussed two parallel approaches to 'denoise' a single image of change in contrast uptake from baseline to one follow-up visit of interest. In this work we extend the image model to explore the longitudinal profile of the tumour-healthy tissue contrast uptake in multiple images over time. We fit a two-stage model. First, we propose a longitudinal image model for each subject. This model simultaneously accounts for the spatial and temporal correlation and denoises the observed images by borrowing strength both across neighbouring pixels and over time. We propose to use the Mann-Whitney U-statistic to summarize the tumour contrast uptake relative to healthy tissue. In the second stage, we fit a population model to the U-statistic and estimate when it achieves its maximum. Our initial findings suggest that the maximal contrast uptake of the tumour core relative to healthy tissue peaks around 3 weeks after initiation of radiotherapy, though this warrants further investigation.

N2  -  Objective To investigate the value of histogram analysis of T1 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in predicting the grade, subtype, and proliferative activity of meningioma. Methods This prospective study comprised 69 meningioma patients who underwent preoperative MRI including T1 mapping and DWI. The histogram metrics, including mean, median, maximum, minimum, 10th percentiles (C10), 90th percentiles (C90), kurtosis, skewness, and variance, of T1 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were extracted from the whole tumour and peritumoural oedema using FeAture Explorer. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between low- and high-grade tumours. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the differential diagnostic performance. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to further classify meningioma subtypes. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated to analyse the correlations between histogram parameters and Ki-67 expression. Results High-grade meningiomas showed significantly higher mean, maximum, C90, and variance of T1 (p = 0.001-0.009), lower minimum, and C10 of ADC (p = 0.013-0.028), compared to low-grade meningiomas. For all histogram parameters, the highest individual distinctive power was T1 C90 with an AUC of 0.805. The best diagnostic accuracy was obtained by combining the T1 C90 and ADC C10 with an AUC of 0.864. The histogram parameters differentiated 4/6 pairs of subtype pairs. Significant correlations were identified between Ki-67 and histogram parameters of T1 (C90, mean) and ADC (C10, kurtosis, variance). Conclusion T1 and ADC histogram parameters may represent an in vivo biomarker for predicting the grade, subtype, and proliferative activity of meningioma.

N2  -  Little is currently known about the alterations in the topological organization of the white matter (WM) structural networks in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present study, we used diffusion tensor imaging and deterministic tractography to map the WM structural networks in 39 MS patients and 39 age-and gender-matched healthy controls. Graph theoretical methods were applied to investigate alterations in the network efficiency in these patients. The MS patients and the controls exhibited efficient small-world properties in their WM structural networks. However, the global and local network efficiencies were significantly decreased in the MS patients compared with the controls, with the most pronounced changes observed in the sensorimotor, visual, default-mode, and language areas. Furthermore, the decreased network efficiencies were significantly correlated with the expanded disability status scale scores, the disease durations, and the total WM lesion loads. Together, the results suggest a disrupted integrity in the large-scale brain systems in MS, thus providing new insights into the understanding of MS connectome. Our data also suggest that a topology-based brain network analysis can provide potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and for monitoring the progression and treatment effects for patients with MS.

N2  -  Accumulating evidence suggests that tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) may be the endogenous ligand of the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor. The vast majority of TIP39-containing neurons are localized in two regions, the subparafascicular area at the thalamic-mid brain junction, and the medial paralemniscal nucleus in the rostral pons. In contrast to the restricted localization of TIP39-containing cell bodies, TIP39-containing fibers have a widespread distribution. TIP39 neurons were lesioned electrolytically to determine the origin of TIP39-containing fibers within different parts of the rat CNS. Following bilateral lesions of the medial subparafascicular area including the subparafascicular nucleus, TIP39-immunoreactive fibers almost completely disappeared from forebrain regions including the anterior limbic cortical areas, the shell and cone portions of the nucleus accumbens, the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the amygdaloid nuclei, the fundus striati, the subiculum, the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, and the hypothalamic paraventricular, dorsomedial and arcuate nuclei. Unilateral lesions of the medial and the lateral subparafascicular area demonstrated that the projections are ipsilateral and that medial lesions produce higher reductions in the density of TIP39 fibers except in the amygdala and the hypothalamus. Following lesions of the medial paralemniscal nucleus, TIP39-immunoreactive fibers disappeared from the medial geniculate, body, the periaqueductal gray, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, the external cortex of the inferior colliculus, the cuneiform nucleus, the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the subcoeruleus area, the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, the periolivary nuclei, and the spinal cord, suggesting that these regions receive TIP39-containing fibers from the medial paralemniscal nucleus, and unilateral lesions demonstrated that the projections are ipsilateral. The projections of the TIP39-containing cells in the subparafascicular area suggest their involvement in limbic and endocrine functions, while the projections of the TIP39-containing cells in the medial paralemniscal nucleus suggest their involvement in auditory and nociceptive functions.

N2  -  To determine if apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) can discriminate between posterior fossa brain tumours on a multicentre basis. A total of 124 paediatric patients with posterior fossa tumours (including 55 Medulloblastomas, 36 Pilocytic Astrocytomas and 26 Ependymomas) were scanned using diffusion weighted imaging across 12 different hospitals using a total of 18 different scanners. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were produced and histogram data was extracted from tumour regions of interest. Total histograms and histogram metrics (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis and 10th, 20th and 50th quantiles) were used as data input for classifiers with accuracy determined by tenfold cross validation. Mean ADC values from the tumour regions of interest differed between tumour types, (ANOVA P<0.001). A cut off value for mean ADC between Ependymomas and Medulloblastomas was found to be of 0.984x10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) with sensitivity 80.8% and specificity 80.0%. Overall classification for the ADC histogram metrics were 85% using Naive Bayes and 84% for Random Forest classifiers. The most commonly occurring posterior fossa paediatric brain tumours can be classified using Apparent Diffusion Coefficient histogram values to a high accuracy on a multicentre basis.

N2  -  The purpose of this study was to develop a voxel-wise analytical solution to a glioma growth model using serial diffusion MRI. These cell invasion, motility, and proliferation level estimates (CIMPLE maps) provide quantitative estimates of microscopic tumor growth dynamics. After an analytical solution was found, noise simulations were performed to predict the effects that perturbations in apparent diffusion coefficient values and the time between apparent diffusion coefficient map acquisitions would have on the accuracy of CIMPLE maps. CIMPLE maps were then created for 53 patients with gliomas with WHO grades of II-IV. MR spectroscopy estimates of the choline-to-N-acetylaspartate ratio were compared to cell proliferation estimates in CIMPLE maps using Pearson's correlation analysis. Median differences in cell proliferation and diffusion rates between WHO grades were compared. A strong correlation (R-2 = 0.9714) and good spatial correspondence were observed between MR spectroscopy measurements of the choline-to-N-acetylaspartate ratio and CIMPLE map cell proliferation rate estimates. Estimates of cell proliferation and diffusion rates appear to be significantly different between low- (WHO II) and high-grade (WHO III-IV) gliomas. Cell diffusion rate (motility) estimates are highly dependent on the time interval between apparent diffusion coefficient map acquisitions, whereas cell proliferation rate estimates are additionally influenced by the level of noise present in apparent diffusion coefficient maps.

N2  -  Purpose: To review the efficacy of a recall system for bi-parametric non-contrast prostate MRI (bp-MRI). Methods: A bi-parametric protocol was instituted in July 2020 for all patients who had a prostate MRI requested, excluding those after treatment of prostate cancer, patients with hip prosthesis or pacemaker, and those who lived out-of-town. The protocol consisted of tri-planar T2-weighted and diffusion weighted images (DWI) (b = 50, 800 s/mm2 for ADC map; b = 1,500 s/mm2 acquired separately) in accordance with the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data system (PI-RADS) v2.1 guidelines. After interpretation of bp-MRI exams, patients with equivocal (PI-RADS 3) lesions in peripheral zone (PZ) or any technical limitations were recalled for contrast administration.Results: Out of 909 bp-MRI scans performed from July 2020 to April 2021, only 52 (5.7 %) were recalled, of which 46 (88.5 %) attended. Amongst these, 41/52 (78.8 %) were recalled for PZ PI-RADS 3 lesions, while the rest of 11 (21.2 %) cases were recalled for technical reasons. Mean time to subsequent recall scan was 11.6 days. On assessment of post-contrast imaging, 29/46 (63 %) cases were upgraded to PI-RADS 4 while 17/46 (37 %) remained PI-RADS 3. This system avoided contrast-agent use in 857 patients, with contrast cost savings of euro64,620 (US$68,560) and 214 hours 15 minutes of scanner time was saved. This allowed 255 additional bp-MRI scans to be performed, reducing the waitlist from 1 year to 2-3 weeks.Conclusion: A bi-parametric prostate MRI protocol with a robust recall system for contrast administration not only saved time eliminating the marked backlog but was also more cost efficient without compromising the quality of patient care.

N2  -  Objective We tried to reveal how the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) was affected in patients with glioblastoma treated with chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) in the period following the treatment, by multiparametric MRI. Materials and methods 43 multiparametric MRI examinations of 17 patients with glioblastoma treated with CRT were examined. A total of six different series or maps were analyzed in the examinations: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) maps, Gradient Echo (GRE) sequence, Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequences. Each sequence in each examination was examined in detail with 14 Region of Interest (ROI) measurements. The obtained values were proportioned to the contralateral NAWM values and the results were recorded as normalized values. Time dependent changes of normalized values were statistically analyzed. Results The most prominent changes in follow-up imaging occurred in the perilesional region. In perilesional NAWM, we found a decrease in normalized FA (nFA), rCBV (nrCBV), rCBF (nrCBF), ASL (nASL)values (p < 0.005) in the first 3 months after treatment, followed by a plateau and an increase approaching pretreatment values, although it did not reach. Similar but milder findings were present in other NAWM areas. In perilesional NAWM, nrCBV values were found to be positively high correlated with nrCBF and nASL, and negatively high correlated with nADC values (r: 0.963, 0.736, - 0.973, respectively). We also found high correlations between the mean values of nrCBV, nrCBF, nASL in other NAWM areas (r: 0.891, 0.864, respectively). Discussion We showed that both DSC and ASL perfusion values decreased correlatively in the first 3 months and showed a plateau after 1 year in patients with glioblastoma treated with CRT, unlike the literature. Although it was not as evident as perfusion MRI, it was observed that the ADC values also showed a plateau pattern following the increase in the first 3 months. Further studies are needed to explain late pathophysiological changes. Because of the high correlation, our results support ASL perfusion instead of contrast enhanced perfusion methods.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a widely used medical imaging modality for diagnosis and monitoring of cerebral stroke. The identification of exact location of stroke lesion helps in perceiving its characteristics, an essential part of diagnosis and treatment planning. This task is challenging due to the typical shape of the stroke lesion. This paper proposes an efficient method for computer-aided delineation of stroke lesions from DWI images.
Proposed methodology comprises of three steps. At the initial step, image contrast has been improved by applying fuzzy intensifier leading to the better visual quality of the stroke lesion. In the following step, a two-class (stroke lesion area vs. non-stroke lesion area) segmentation technique based on Gaussian mixture model has been designed for the localization of stroke lesion. To eliminate the artifacts which would appear during segmentation process, a binary morphological post-processing through area operator has been defined for exact delineation of the lesion area.; The performance of the proposed methodology has been compared with the manually delineated images (ground truth) obtained from different experts, individually. Quantitative evaluation with respect to various performance measures (such as dice coefficient, Jaccard score, and correlation coefficient) shows the efficient performance of the proposed technique.

N2  -  Virtual dissection of diffusion MRI tractograms is cumbersome and needs extensive knowledge of white matter anatomy. This virtual dissection often requires several inclusion and exclusion regions-of-interest that make it a process that is very hard to reproduce across experts. Having automated tools that can extract white matter bundles for tract-based studies of large numbers of people is of great interest for neuroscience and neurosurgical planning. The purpose of our proposed method, named RecoBundles, is to segment white matter bundles and make virtual dissection easier to perform. This can help explore large tractograms from multiple persons directly in their native space. RecoBundles leverages latest state-of-the-art streamline-based registration and clustering to recognize and extract bundles using prior bundle models. RecoBundles uses bundle models as shape priors for detecting similar streamlines and bundles in tractograms. RecoBundles is 100% streamline-based, is efficient to work with millions of streamlines and, most importantly, is robust and adaptive to incomplete data and bundles with missing components. It is also robust to pathological brains with tumors and deformations. We evaluated our results using multiple bundles and showed that RecoBundles is in good agreement with the neuroanatomical experts and generally produced more dense bundles. Across all the different experiments reported in this paper, RecoBundles was able to identify the core parts of the bundles, independently from tractography type (deterministic or probabilistic) or size. Thus, RecoBundles can be a valuable method for exploring tractograms and facilitating tractometry studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Awake craniotomy is currently considered the gold standard to maximise the extent of resection and to minimise postoperative deficits in patients with supratentorial tumours near eloquent areas. In addition to direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the cortex, intraoperative subcortical mapping is increasingly used as it optimises the benefit-to-risk ratio by decreasing (permanent) postoperative neurological deficits. However, only little attention has been paid to subcortical mapping procedures and especially the tasks to be used.
In this article, language and non-language testing at the subcortical level is described and discussed by means of three right-handed cases with a glioma in the left hemisphere. To assess subcortical functions, a multimodal test named the Quick Mixed Test was developed (QMT). Pre-, intra- and postoperative test results are described and discussed in detail.; Based on the analysis of these preliminary observations, a number of clinical recommendations for intraoperative subcortical mapping may be made: (1) the selection of a set of language and non-language tests needs to be tailored according to the functional corticosubcortical regions affected by the tumoral lesion and the patient's characteristics (jobhobbydaily life activities); (2) language and non-language tests should be presented in a multimodal and alternating way during subcortical stimulation since this approach enables screening various functions simultaneously or in a very short period of time and (3) spontaneous speech is a useful adjunct to standardised tests since it most resembles daily life conversation.; Administration of multimodal tests during subcortical DES such as the experimental QMT may facilitate identification of eloquent pathways leading to avoidance of permanent neurological impairments.

N2  -  PurposeThis study aimed to describe our institutional use of a commercially available mixed reality viewer within a multi-disciplinary planning workflow for awake craniotomy surgery and to report an assessment of its usability.Materials and methodsThree Tesla MRI scans, including 32-direction diffusion tensor sequences, were reconstructed with BrainLab Elements auto-segmentation software. Magic Leap mixed reality viewer headsets were registered to a shared virtual viewing space to display image reconstructions. System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of the mixed reality system.ResultsThe awake craniotomy planning workflow utilises the mixed reality viewer to facilitate a stepwise discussion through four progressive anatomical layers; the skin, cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter tracts and tumour with surrounding vasculature. At each stage relevant members of the multi-disciplinary team review key operative considerations, including patient positioning, cortical and subcortical speech mapping protocols and surgical approaches to the tumour.The mixed reality system was used for multi-disciplinary awake craniotomy planning in 10 consecutive procedures over a 5-month period. Ten participants (2 Anaesthetists, 5 Neurosurgical trainees, 2 Speech therapists, 1 Neuropsychologist) completed System Usability Scale assessments, reporting a mean score of 71.5. Feedback highlighted the benefit of being able to rehearse important steps in the procedure, including patient positioning and anaesthetic access and visualising the testing protocol for cortical and subcortical speech mapping.ConclusionsThis study supports the use of mixed reality for multidisciplinary planning for awake craniotomy surgery, with an acceptable degree of usability of the interface. We highlight the need to consider the requirements of non-technical, non-neurosurgical team members when involving mixed reality activities.

N2  -  Background. Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. Each tumor comprises multiple genetically distinct clonal populations with different therapeutic sensitivities. This has implications for targeted therapy and genetically informed paradigms. Contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI and conventional sampling techniques have failed to resolve this heterogeneity, particularly for nonenhancing tumor populations. This study explores the feasibility of using multiparametric MRI and texture analysis to characterize regional genetic heterogeneity throughout MRI-enhancing and nonenhancing tumor segments.
Methods. We collected multiple image-guided biopsies from primary GBM patients throughout regions of enhancement (ENH) and nonenhancing parenchyma (so called brain-around-tumor,  BAT). For each biopsy, we analyzed DNA copy number variants for core GBM driver genes reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas. We co-registered biopsy locations with MRI and texture maps to correlate regional genetic status with spatially matched imaging measurements. We also built multivariate predictive decision-tree models for each GBM driver gene and validated accuracies using leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV).; Results. We collected 48 biopsies (13 tumors) and identified significant imaging correlations (univariate analysis) for 6 driver genes: EGFR, PDGFRA, PTEN, CDKN2A, RB1, and TP53. Predictive model accuracies (on LOOCV) varied by driver gene of interest. Highest accuracies were observed for PDGFRA (77.1%), EGFR (75%), CDKN2A (87.5%), and RB1 (87.5%), while lowest accuracy was observed in TP53 (37.5%). Models for 4 driver genes (EGFR, RB1, CDKN2A, and PTEN) showed higher accuracy in BAT samples (n = 16) compared with those from ENH segments (n = 32).; Conclusion MRI and texture analysis can help characterize regional genetic heterogeneity, which offers potential diagnostic value under the paradigm of individualized oncology.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) helps to determine the distribution of motor eloquent areas prior to brain surgery. Yet, the eloquence of primary motor areas frontal to the precentral gyrus identified via nTMS is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resection of nTMS-positive prerolandic motor areas and its correlation with postsurgical impairment of motor function.; METHODS: Forty-three patients with rolandic or prerolandic gliomas (WHO grade I-IV) underwent nTMS prior to surgery. Only patients without ischemia within the motor system in postoperative MRI diffusion sequences were enrolled. Based on the 3-dimensional fusion of preoperative nTMS motor mapping data with postsurgical MRI scans, we identified nTMS points that were resected in the infiltration zone of the tumor. We then classified the resected points according to the localization and latency of their motor evoked potentials. Surgery-related paresis was graded as transient (<= 6 weeks) or permanent (>6 weeks).; RESULTS: Out of 43, 31 patients (72%) showed nTMS-positive motor points in the prerolandic gyri. In general, 13 out of 43 patients (30%) underwent resection of nTMS points. Ten out of these patients showed postoperative paresis. There were 2 (15%) patients with a transient and 8 (62%) with a permanent surgery-related paresis. In 3 cases (23%), motor function remained unimpaired.; CONCLUSION: After resection of nTMS-positive motor points, 62% of patients suffered from a new permanent paresis. Thus, even though they are located in the superior or middle frontal gyrus, these cortical areas must undergo intraoperative mapping.

N2  -  Essential tremor and Parkinson's disease-associated tremor are extremely prevalent within the field of movement disorders. The ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus has been commonly used as both a neuromodulatory and neuroablative target for the treatment of these forms of tremor. With both deep brain stimulation and Gamma Knife radiosurgery, there is an abundance of literature regarding the surgical planning, targeting, and outcomes of these methodologies. To date, there have been no reports of frameless, linear accelerator (LINAC)-based thalomotomies for tremor.
The authors report the case of a patient with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, with poor tremor improvement with medication, who was offered LINAC-based thalamotomy. High-resolution 0.9-mm isotropic MR images were obtained, and simulation was performed via CT with 1.5-mm contiguous slices. The VIM thalamic nucleus was determined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based segmentation on FSL using probabilistic tractography. The supplemental motor and premotor areas were the cortical target masks. The authors centered their isocenter within the region of the DTI-determined target and treated the patient with 140 Gy in a single fraction. The DTI-determined target had coordinates of 14.2 mm lateral and 8.36 mm anterior to the posterior commissure (PC), and 3 mm superior to the anterior commissure (AC)-PC line, which differed by 3.30 mm from the original target determined by anatomical considerations (15.5 mm lateral and 7 mm anterior to the PC, and 0 mm superior to the AC-PC line). There was faint radiographic evidence of lesioning at the 3-month follow-up within the target zone, which continued to consolidate on subsequent scans. The patient experienced continued right upper-extremity resting tremor improvement starting at 10 months until it was completely resolved at 22 months of follow-up.; Frameless LINAC-based thalamotomy guided by DTI-based thalamic segmentation is a feasible method for achieving radiosurgical lesions of the VIM thalamus to treat tremor. https:thejns.orgdoiabs10.31712016.10.JNS161603

N2  -  Rationale and Objectives: The peritumoral region of glioblastoma (GBM) is composed of infiltrating tumor cells and vasogenic edema, which are difficult to distinguish manually on MRI. To distinguish tumor cell infiltration and vasogenic edema in GBM peritumoral regions, it is crucial to develop a method that is precise, effective, and widely applicable. Materials and Methods: We retrieved the image characteristics of 379,730 voxels (marker of tumor infiltration) from 28 non-enhanced gliomas and 365,262 voxels (marker of edema) from the peritumoral edema region of 14 meningiomas on conventional MRI sequences (T1-weighted image, the contrast-enhancing T1-weighted image, the T2-weighted image, the T2 -fluid attenuated inversion recovery image, and the apparent diffusion coefficient map). Using the SVM classifier, a model for predicting tumor cell infiltration and vasogenic edema at the voxel level was developed. The accuracy of the model's predictions was then evaluated using 15 GBM patients who underwent stereotactic biopsies. Results: The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the prediction model were 0.93, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.85 in the training set, and 0.90, 0.82, 0.83, and 0.83 in the test set (704,992 voxels), respectively. The pathology verification of 28 biopsy points with an accuracy of 0.79. Conclusion: At the voxel level, it seems possible to forecast tumor cell infiltration and vasogenic edema in the peritumoral region of GBM based on conventional MRI sequences.

N2  -  Background: Mutism and dense retrograde amnesia are found both in organic and dissociative contexts. Moreover, dissociative symptoms may be modulated by right prefrontal activity. A single case, M. R., developed left hemiparesis, mutism and retrograde amnesia after a high-voltage electric shock without evidence of lasting brain lesions. M. R. suddenly recovered from his mutism following a mild brain trauma 2 years later. Methods: M.R.'s neuropsychological pattern and anatomoclinical correlations were studied through (i) language and memory assessment to characterize his deficits, (ii) functional neuroimaging during a standard language paradigm, and (iii) assessment of frontal and left insular connectivity through diffusion tractography imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation. A control evaluation was repeated after recovery. Findings: M. R. recovered from the left hemiparesis within 90 days of the accident, which indicated a transient right brain impairment. One year later, neurobehavioral, language and memory evaluations strongly suggested a dissociative component in the mutism and ret-rograde amnesia. Investigations (including MRI, fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, EEG and r-TMS) were normal. Twentyseven months after the electrical injury, M. R. had a very mild head injury which was followed by a rapid recovery of speech. However, the retrograde amnesia persisted. Discussion: This case indicates an interaction of both organic and dissociative mechanisms in order to explain the patient's symptoms. The study also illustrates dissociation in the time course of the two different dissociative symptoms in the same patient. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  Background: The particular function of the left anterior human insula on emotional arousal has been illustrated with several case studies. Only after left hemispheric insula lesions, patients lose their pleasure in habits such as listening to joyful music. In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI) activation in the left anterior insula has been associated with both processing of emotional valence and arousal. Tight interactions with different areas of the prefrontal cortex are involved in bodily response monitoring and cognitive appraisal of a given stimulus. Therefore, a large left hemispheric lesion including the left insula should impair the bodily response of chill experience (objective chill response) but leave the cognitive aspects of chill processing (subjective chill response) unaffected.
Methods: We investigated a patient (MC) with a complete left hemispheric media cerebral artery stroke, testing fMRI representation of pleasant (music) and unpleasant (harsh sounds) chill response.; Results: Although chill response to both pleasant and unpleasant rated sounds was confirmed verbally at passages also rated as chilling by healthy participants, skin conductance response was almost absent in MC. For a healthy control (HC) objective and subjective chill response was positively associated. Bilateral prefrontal fMRI-response to chill stimuli was sustained in MC whereas insula activation restricted to the right hemisphere. Diffusion imaging together with lesion maps revealed that left lateral tracts were completely damaged but medial prefrontal structures were intact.; Conclusion: With this case study we demonstrate how bodily response and cognitive appraisal are differentially participating in the internal monitor of chill response.

N2  -  Rationale:Recovery of injured AF in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been reported. In this study, we report on a patient with TBI who recovered from an injury to Broca's portion of AF in the dominant hemisphere, diagnosed by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).Patient concerns:A 28-year-old right-handed male patient suffered head trauma resulting from sliding while riding a motorcycle.Diagnoses:He was diagnosed with a traumatic contusional hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hemorrhage in the left fronto-temporal lobe.Interventions:He underwent craniectomy on the left fronto-temporal area, and hematoma removal for the subdural hemorrhage in the neurosurgery department of a university hospital. Two weeks after the injury, he was transferred to the rehabilitation department of another university hospital. He showed severe aphasia and brain MRI showed leukomalactic lesion in the left frontal lobe.Outcomes:The result WAB for the patient showed severe aphasia, with an aphasia quotient of 45.3 percentile. However, his aphasia improved rapidly by 9 months with an aphasia quotient at the 100.0 percentile. 2-week DTT detected discontinuity in the subcortical white matter at the branch to Broca's area of left AF. By contrast, on 9-month DTT, the discontinued portion of left AF was elongated to the left Broca's area.Lessons:Recovery of injured Broca's portion of AF in the dominant hemisphere along with excellent improvement of aphasia was demonstrated in a patient with TBI. This study has important implications in brain rehabilitation because the mechanism of recovery from aphasia following TBI has not been elucidated.

N2  -  Background Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with NSCLC showing a less aggressive clinical course and lower chemo- and radio sensitivity compared to SCLC. Early adequate therapy is highly desirable and depends on a reliable classification of tumor type. The apparent diffusion coefficient is a noninvasive neuroimaging marker with the potential to differentiate between major histological subtypes. Here we determine the sensitivity and specificity of the apparent diffusion coefficient to distinguish between NSCLC and SCLC. Methods We enrolled all NSCLC and SCLC patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2019 at the University Medical Center Gottingen. Cranial MR scans were visually inspected for brain metastases and the ratio of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated by dividing the ADC measured within the solid part of a metastasis by a reference ADC extracted from an equivalent region in unaffected tissue on the contralateral hemisphere. Results Out of 411 enrolled patients, we detected 129 patients (83 NSCLC, 46 SCLC) with sufficiently large brain metastases with histologically classified lung cancer and no hemorrhage. We analyzed 185 brain metastases, 84 of SCLC and 101 of NSCLC. SCLC brain metastases showed an ADC ratio of 0.68 +/- 0.12 SD, and NSCLC brain metastases showed an ADC ratio of 1.47 +/- 0.31 SD. Receiver operating curve statistics differentiated brain metastases of NSCLC from SCLC with an area under the curve of 0.99 and a 95% CI of 0.98 to 1, p < 0.001. Youden's J cut-point is 0.97 at a sensitivity of 0.989 and a specificity of 0.988. Conclusions In patients with lung cancer and brain metastases with solid tumor parts, ADC ratio enables an ad hoc differentiation of SCLC and NSCLC, easily achieved during routine neuroradiological examination. Non-invasive MR imaging enables an early-individualized management of brain metastases from lung cancer. Trial registration: The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00023016).

N2  -  Background. Glioma is the most common fatal malignant tumor of the CNS. Early detection of glioma grades based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) properties is considered one of the most recent noninvasive promising tools in the assessment of glioma grade and could be helpful in monitoring patient prognosis and response to therapy.Aim. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of DWI at both standard and highbvalues (b = 1000 s/mm(2)andb = 3000 s/mm(2)) to distinguish high-grade glioma (HGG) from low-grade glioma (LGG) in clinical practice based on histopathological results.Materials and Methods. Twenty-three patients with glioma had DWI at l.5 T MR using two differentbvalues (b = 1000 s/mm(2)andb = 3000 s/mm(2)) at Al-Shifa Medical Complex after obtaining ethical and administrative approvals, and data were collected from March 2019 to March 2020. Minimum, maximum, and mean of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured through drawing region of interest (ROI) on a solid part at ADC maps. Data were analyzed by using the MedCalc analysis program, version 19.0.4, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done, and optimal cutoff values for grading gliomas were determined. Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.Results. The obtained results showed the ADC(mean), ADC(ratio), ADC(max), and ADC(min)were performed to differentiate between LGG and HGG at both standard and highbvalues. Moreover, ADC values were inversely proportional to glioma grade, and these differences are more obvious at highbvalue. Minimum ADC values using standardbvalue were 1.13 +/- 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.89 +/- 0.85 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, and 0.82 +/- 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for grades II, III, and IV, respectively. Concerning highbvalue, ADC(min)values were 0.76 +/- 0.07 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, 0.61 +/- 0.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, and 0.48 +/- 0.07 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for grades II, III, and IV, respectively. ADC values were inversely correlated with results of glioma grades, and the correlation was stronger at ADC(3000)(r = -0.722,P <= 0.001). The ADC(3000)achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.618, 100% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, and 85.7% accuracy for glioma grading at a cutoff point of <= 0.618 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. The highbvalue showed stronger agreement with histopathology compared with standardbvalue results (k = 0.89 and 0.79), respectively.Conclusion. The ADC values decrease with an increase in tumor cellularity. Meanwhile, highbvalue provides better tissue contrast by reflecting more tissue diffusivity. Therefore, ADC-derived parameters at highbvalue are more useful in the grading of glioma than those obtained at standardbvalue. They might be a better surrogate imaging sequence in the preoperative evaluation of gliomas.

N2  -  The inhibitory effects of stimulation in the caudal part of the ipsilateral or contralateral ventral posterior lateral (VPLc) thalamus nucleus were examined in recordings from 52 spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in the lumbosacral enlargement of anesthetized monkeys [Macaca fascicularis]. The stimulation site in the contralateral VPLc nucleus was also employed to activate STT cells antidromically. STT neurons were classified as wide dynamic range (WDR) or high threshold (HT) on the basis of their responses to mechanical stimulation of their cutaneous receptive fields. Strong inhibitory effects were noted following stimulation in either the ipsilateral or the contralateral VPLc nucleus. Inhibition affected both WDR and HT neurons. Responses to innocuous and noxious cutaneous mechanical stimuli as well as to noxious heat were reduced. Inhibition often outlasted the duration of the stimulus train. The average latency to onset of inhibition following the beginning of the stimulus train was 33.7 ms (n = 40). The responses of STT cells to electrical stimulation of A- and C-fibers in the sural nerve were reduced during stimulation in the VPLc nuclei. Responses to C-fibers were inhibited to a greater extent than were responses to myelinated afferents. Mapping experiments were done in 8 monkeys to determine the distribution of thalamic sites producing inhibition of STT cells. The most powerful inhibition resulted from stimulation within the VPL and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei. In some cases inhibition was produced using stimulus currents < 25 .mu.A. Lesions of the upper cervical spinal cord were effective in eliminating inhibition produced by ipsilateral VPLc stimulation only when the lesions included the dorsolateral funiculi (DLF) bilaterally and the ventral part of the ipsilateral lateral funiculus. Pathways that might mediate the inhibitory effect of thalamic stimulation on STT neurons are discussed. These include a thalamocortical-corticofugal pathway and pathways excited by the antidromic activation of STT or brain stem axons. Antidromic volleys in STT axons could activate descending inhibitory pathways from the medial brain stem via axon collaterals or, alternatively, they might activate a propriospinal inhibitory system.

N2  -  Introduction
In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed to predict tissue outcome in acute stroke patients using machine learning methods incorporating multiparametric imaging data. Most methods include diffusion and perfusion parameters as image-based parameters but do not include any spatial information although these parameters are spatially dependent, e.g. different perfusion properties in white and gray brain matter. This study aims to investigate if including spatial features improves the accuracy of multi-parametric tissue outcome prediction.; Materials and methods; Acute and follow-up multi-center MRI datasets of 99 patients were available for this study. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost machine learning models were trained and tested using acute MR diffusion and perfusion features and known follow-up lesions. Different combinations of atlas coordinates and lesion probability maps were included as spatial information. The stroke lesion predictions were compared to the true tissue outcomes using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the Dice metric.; Results; The statistical analysis revealed that including spatial features significantly improves the tissue outcome prediction. Overall, the XGBoost and random forest models performed best in every setting and achieved state-of-the-art results regarding both metrics with similar improvements achieved including Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space coordinates or voxel-wise lesion probabilities.; Conclusion; Spatial features should be integrated to improve lesion outcome prediction using machine learning models.

N2  -  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes injury that occurs to the brain as a result of trauma. It should be appreciated as a heterogeneous, dynamic pathophysiological process that starts from the moment of impact and continues over time with sequelae potentially seen many years after the initial event. Primary traumatic brain lesions that may occur at the moment of impact include contusions, haematomas, parenchymal fractures and diffuse axonal injury. The presence of extra-axial intracranial lesions such as epidural and subdural haematomas and subarachnoid haemorrhage must be anticipated as they may contribute greatly to secondary brain insult by provoking brain herniation syndromes, cranial nerve deficits, oedema and ischaemia and infarction. Imaging is fundamental to the management of patients with TBI. CT remains the imaging modality of choice for initial assessment due to its ease of access, rapid acquisition and for its sensitivity for detection of acute haemorrhagic lesions for surgical intervention. MRI is typically reserved for the detection of lesions that may explain clinical symptoms that remain unresolved despite initial CT. This is especially apparent in the setting of diffuse axonal injury, which is poorly discerned on CT. Use of particular MRI sequences may increase the sensitivity of detecting such lesions: diffusion-weighted imaging defining acute infarction, susceptibility-weighted imaging affording exquisite data on microhaemorrhage. Additional advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI may provide important information regarding coexistent structural and functional brain damage. Gaining robust prognostic information for patients following TBI remains a challenge. Advanced MRI sequences are showing potential for biomarkers of disease, but this largely remains at the research level. Various global collaborative research groups have been established in an effort to combine imaging data with clinical and epidemiological information to provide much needed evidence for improvement in the characterisation and classification of TBI and in the identity of the most effective clinical care for this patient cohort. However, analysis of collaborative imaging data is challenging: the diverse spectrum of image acquisition and postprocessing limits reproducibility, and there is a requirement for a robust quality assurance initiative. Future clinical use of advanced neuroimaging should ensure standardised approaches to image acquisition and analysis, which can be used at the individual level, with the expectation that future neuroimaging advances, personalised to the patient, may improve prognostic accuracy and facilitate the development of new therapies.

N2  -  Recent findings suggest that the topography and propagation of lesions in Alzheimer's disease are related to functional connectivity, either showing that regions of high global connectivity are more vulnerable or that lesions propagate neuron-to-neuron from a starting area called the epicentre, thus involving specific connectivity. However, the relative influence of specific and global connectivity and their differential impact on the three main neuroimaging biomarkers of the disease (atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition) have never been investigated to date. Forty-two healthy elderly subjects and 35 amyloid-beta positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients underwent resting-state functional MRI, anatomical T-1-weighted MRI, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and florbetapir-PET scans. All patients also underwent follow-up T-1-weighted MRI, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and florbetapir-PET scans 18 months later to assess the lesion propagation. The epicentre was defined per modality as the most altered region at baseline in patients compared to controls. Maps of global and specific functional connectivity were computed from the resting-state functional MRI data of the healthy elderly subjects. Global connectivity corresponds to the connectivity strength of each grey matter area with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other grey matter areas) while specific connectivity refers to the connectivity of a single specific brain region (the epicentre) with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other brain regions). Maps of baseline alterations and propagation were computed for grey matter atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition in patients. Regression analyses were performed across the 239 brain regions to assess the links between global or specific functional connectivity in healthy elderly subjects and Alzheimer's disease-related baseline disruptions or alteration propagation. Atrophy at baseline was predicted by specific connectivity and inversely correlated with global connectivity, while hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition were positively influenced by both global and specific connectivity. Regarding longitudinal changes, atrophy spread in regions with high specific connectivity while hypometabolism propagated in areas showing high global connectivity. This is the first study to show that global connectivity has an opposite relationship with atrophy versus hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition, suggesting that the high level of functional connectivity found in hubs exerts a differential influence on these Alzheimer's disease lesions. These results sustain the hypotheses of higher vulnerability of hubs to hypometabolism and amyloid-beta deposition versus transneuronal propagation of atrophy from the epicentre to connected regions, in Alzheimer's disease. Global and specific connectivity exert a differential influence on, and provide complementary information to predict, the topography of Alzheimer's disease lesions and their propagation.

N2  -  Objectives: A delayed stroke-like leukoencephalopathy has been observed in patients receiving methotrexate (MTX) for childhood leukemia. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) may help to distinguish between ischemic stroke and chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy. Although conventional MRI correlates have been described for this stroke-like syndrome, DWI data are largely unavailable. Our objective is to present a retrospective analysis of the DWI findings in four patients who suffered subacute neurotoxicity after intrathecal MTX.
Design: We reviewed the medical records of four patients, who were seen by us between July 2000 and February 2004 for sudden onset of a central neurological syndrome within days of intrathecal MTX. Patients underwent standardized MRI within 48 h of symptom onset; MRI included DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.; Results: DWI of all patients revealed well-demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter corresponding to areas of restricted proton diffusion on ADC maps. Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalization of ADC abnormalities.; Conclusions: DWI findings in this cohort seem to reflect cytotoxic edema within cerebral white matter suggesting a reversible metabolic derangement, rather than ischemia, as the basis for this syndrome.

N2  -  This article reports a case of Mills' syndrome that initially manifested as atrophy of one cerebral hemisphere and decreased brain metabolism, which developed into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the fourth year of the disease. Mills' syndrome is a rare type of motor neuron disease, with only over 20 cases reported since 1990, but most lack imaging such as PET and DTI. This article provides a complete report of the 18F-FDG-PET and DTI images consistent with the characteristics of Mills' syndrome. In addition, we have discovered some new phenomena, which have certain clinical and teaching values. Firstly, the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes on the side of the lesion in the pyramidal tract of this patient were significantly atrophic, indicating that unilateral brain lobe atrophy may be a new feature of Mills' syndrome. Secondly, although there were no abnormalities in three EMG tests taken during the 4 years prior to the onset of the disease, amyotrophy and ALS-like EMG features appeared in the fourth year, suggesting that some Mills' syndrome may progress more rapidly to ALS. This highlights the importance of regular follow-up electromyography in Mills' syndrome patients.

N2  -  A 5-month-old boy with Walker-Warburg syndrome is reported. On MR imaging a characteristic pontomesencephalic kink was evident. Collicular fusion, hydrocephalus, callosal dysgenesis, cobblestone lissencephaly, small cerebellar cysts, pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, and bilateral subretinal hemorrhages were noted. ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps of an echoplanar diffusion MR imaging sequence revealed an elevated diffusion pattern throughout the cerebral white matter, manifested with prominently high ADC values, ranging from 1.82 to 2.45 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. This corresponded to prominent hypomyelination. On the other hand, ADC values of the lissencephalic cortex were normal, ranging from 0.95 to 0.97 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. In addition, ADC values from the hypoplastic cerebellar hemispheres, and from the hypoplastic pons were normal.

N2  -  Objective: To characterize the effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy and early reperfusion on diffusion-weighted (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) changes observed following acute ischemic injury. Methods: Twelve patients were evaluated prospectively using echo planar DWI and bolus tracking PWI. Six patients received IV rt-PA 0.9 mg/kg and were compared with six patients who did not. Patients receiving rt-PA were initially imaged (T1) 3 to 5 hours postictus (mean, 4 hours 20 minutes)whereas those not treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA);were imaged 4 to 7 hours postictus (mean, 5 hours, 25 minutes), Follow-up imaging was performed 3 to 6 hours (T2), 24 to 36 hours (T3), 5 to 7 days (T4),and 30 days (T5) after the first:scan in all patients. Lesion volumes were measured on both DWI and time-to-peak maps constructed from PW images. Results: PWI was performed successfully at T1 and T3 in 11 of 12 patients. In the group that received IV tPA, initial PT;VI volumes were less than DWI volumes in five of six patients (83%), whereas only one of five patients (20%) not receiving tPA had PWI ( DWI volume (p = 0.08). PWI normalized by 24 to 36 hours (T3) in 6 of 11 patients (early reperfusers), with 5 of 6 of these early reperfusers having received tPA. The aggregate: apparent diffusion coefficient ADC) values for the early reperfusers were consistently higher at T2 (p = 0.04), T3 (p = 0.002), and T4 (p = 0.0005). Five of six patients with early reperfusion demonstrated regions of elevated ADC within, the ischemic zone (mean ipsilateral ADC/contralateral ADC, 1.46 +/- 0.19) by 24 to 36 hours, whereas none of the nonearly reperfusers showed these regions of elevated ADC (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Early reperfusion is seen more frequently with IV tPA therapy. In addition, the study showed that ADC may undergo early increases that are tied closely to, reperfusion and marked ADC heterogeneity may exist within the same lesion; Early reperfusion is seen more frequently with IV tPA therapy.

N2  -  Background and Purpose - Multiple brain infarcts are often seen on diffusion-weighted images in cardioembolic stroke patients. Recently, mobile aortic plaques (MAPs) have been proposed as embolic sources. However, the clinical characteristics of patients with MAPs are unclear.
Methods - We prospectively studied patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent transesophageal echocardiography. The patients were classified into 3 groups based on transesophageal echocardiography findings: atheromatous aortic plaques <4 mm, atheromatous aortic plaques >= 4 mm without mobility, and MAPs. Based on their diffusion-weighted image findings, the patients were divided into 3 subgroups: (1) single lesion; (2) multiple lesions in a single vascular territory; and (3) multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories. We assessed the clinical characteristics and the diffusion-weighted image findings of stroke patients with MAPs.; Results - One hundred sixty-seven patients (age, 70 +- 12 years; 98 males) were enrolled; 128 (77%) had atheromatous aortic plaques <4 mm, 27 (16%) had atheromatous aortic plaques <4 mm, and 12 (7%) had MAPs. Older age, male gender, coronary artery disease, and cerebral arterial stenotic lesions were seen most frequently in patients with MAPs. On diffusion-weighted image findings, patients with MAPs were most frequent in the multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories group (P = 0.001). On multiple logistic regression analysis, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.22; P = 0.039), arterial stenotic lesions (OR: 4.71; 95% CI: 1.35 to 16.41; P = 0.015), and mobile aortic plaques (OR: 14.44; 95% CI: 2.87 to 72.66; P = 0.001) were significantly associated with the multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories group.; Conclusions - MAPs were not uncommonly observed in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MAPs could cause multiple brain infarcts on diffusion-weighted images.

N2  -  Suppressing and flexibly adapting actions are a critical part of our daily behavioral repertoire. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients show clear impairments in this type of action control; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we tested whether white matter integrity of cortico-subcortical pathways could account for impairments in task switching, an important component of executive functioning. Twenty young adults with TBI and eighteen controls performed a switching task requiring attention to global versus local stimulus features. Diffusion weighted images were acquired and whole brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to explore where white matter damage was associated with switching impairment. A crossing fiber model and probabilistic tractography further identified the specific fiber populations. Relative to controls, patients with a history of TBI had a higher switch cost and were less accurate. The TBI group showed a widespread decline in fractional anisotropy (FA) throughout the TBSS skeleton. FA in the superior corona radiata showed a negative relationship with switch cost. More specifically, this involved cortico-subcortical loops with the (pre-)supplementary motor area and superior frontal gyrus. These findings provide evidence for damage to frontal-subcortical projections in TBI, which is associated with task switching impairments. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2459-2469, 2014.

N2  -  Introduction: In Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA), mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment remain debated. We aimed to assess the association of cognitive impairment with the degree and the topography of cerebral hypoperfusion in MMA. Methods: A retrospective analysis of neuropsychological and perfusion MRI data from adults with MMA was performed. Ischemic and haemorrhagic lesion masks were created to account for cerebral lesions in the analysis of cerebral perfusion. Whole brain volume of hypoperfused parenchyma was outlined on perfusion maps using different Tmax thresholds from 4 to 12 s. Regional analysis produced mean Tmax values at different regions of interest. Analyses compared perfusion ratios in patients with and without cognitive impairment, with multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors. Results: Cognitive impairment was found in 20/48 (41.7%) patients. Attention/processing speed and memory were equally impaired (24%) followed by executive domain (23%). After adjustment, especially for lesion volume, hypoperfused parenchyma volume outlined by Tmax > 4 s or Tmax > 5 s thresholds was an independent factor of cognitive impairment (OR for Tmax > 4 s = 1.06 [CI 95% 1.008-1.123]) as well as attention/processing speed (OR for Tmax > 4 s = 1.07 [CI 95% 1.003-1.133]) and executive domains (OR for Tmax > 5 s = 1.08 [CI 95% 1.004-1.158]). Regarding cognitive functions, patients with processing speed and flexibility impairment had higher frontal Tmax compared to other ROIs and to patients with normal test scores. Discussion: Cerebral hypoperfusion emerged as an independent factor of cognitive impairment in MMA particularly in attention/processing speed and executive domains, with a strong contribution of frontal areas. Conclusion: Considering this association, revascularization surgery could improve cognitive impairment.

N2  -  The structure and function of the brain can be described by complex network models, and the topological properties of these models can be quantified by graph theoretical analysis. This has given insight into brain regions, known as hubs, which are critical for integrative functioning and information transfer, both fundamental aspects of cognition. In this manuscript a hypothesis is put forward for the concept of cognitive eloquence in neurosurgery; that is regions (cortical, subcortical and white matter) of the brain which may not necessarily have readily identifiable neurological function, but if injured may result in disproportionate cognitive morbidity. To this end, the effects of neurosurgical resection on cognition is reviewed and an overview of the role of complex network analysis in the understanding of brain structure and function is provided. The literature describing network, behavioral, and cognitive effects resulting from lesions to, and disconnections of, centralized hub regions will be emphasized as evidence for the espousal of the concept of cognitive eloquence.

N2  -  Objectives: Acute cerebral infarction may coexist with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) because lacunae and hypertensive ICH share common risk factors and small-vessel pathology. We sought to determine the frequency and predictors of new ischemic lesions (NIL) on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), in patients with acute hypertensive ICH, and to investigate whether NIL predicts subsequent clinical cerebrovascular events.
Methods: This prospective study enrolled 97 patients with acute hypertensive ICH diagnosed within 3 days after onset. DWI and gradient echo T2*-weighted imaging were performed 5 days after onset. NIL was defined as hyperintense DWI lesions accompanying low intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Patients were regularly followed up for subsequent clinical cerebrovascular events or vascular deaths.; Results: Forty-nine asymptomatic NILs were observed in 26 (26.8%) patients, with 37 of the 49 NILs (75.5%) located in subcortical white matter or brainstem. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that baseline microbleeds >2 and moderate to severe white matter leukoaraiosis were independently associated with NIL. During a median follow-up of 42 months (interquartile range, 38-47 months), 9 patients experienced clinical cerebrovascular events or vascular deaths. Cox proportional hazards models showed that NILs were independently associated with the composite of clinical cerebrovascular events or vascular death and marginally associated with clinical ischemic stroke.; Conclusions: NILs frequently occur during the acute phase of ICH and are mainly associated with small-vessel pathogenesis. NILs occurring together with ICH may be a useful marker to identify patients at high risk of future clinical cerebrovascular events or vascular death. Neurology (R) 2012;79:848-855

N2  -  Background and Purpose: The etiologic diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes is of particular importance when considering syndromes of vascular or degenerative origin. The purpose of this study is to find differences in the white-matter architecture between those two groups in elderly patients.
Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients were prospectively included (multiple-system atrophy, n= 5; Parkinson's disease, n=15; progressive supranuclear palsy, n=9; vascular parkinsonism, n= 6), with a mean age of 76 years. Patients with multiple-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease were grouped as having parkinsonian syndromes of degenerative origin. Brain MRIs included diffusion tensor imaging. Fractional anisotropy and mean-diffusivity maps were spatially normalized, and group analyses between parkinsonian syndromes of degenerative origin and vascular parkinsonism were performed using a voxel-based approach.; Results: Statistical parametric-mapping analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data showed decreased fractional anisotropy value in internal capsules bilaterally in patients with vascular parkinsonism compared to parkinsonian syndromes of degenerative origin (p = 0.001) and showed a lower mean diffusivity in the white matter of the left superior parietal lobule (p = 0.01).; Fractional anisotropy values were found decreased in the middle cerebellar peduncles in multiplesystem atrophy compared to Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. The mean diffusivity was increased in those regions for these subgroups.; Conclusion: Clinically defined vascular parkinsonism was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy in the deep white matter (internal capsules) compared to parkinsonian syndromes of degenerative origin. These findings are consistent with previously published neuropathological data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in white matter integrity between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy controls, as determined using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data.
Methods. Twelve patients with SLE (mean age 42 years range 15-61 years) diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology 1982 revised criteria for SLE and 28 healthy controls (mean age 46 years range 21-61 years) were included in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3.0T scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated for each patient. TBSS analysis was used to compare the FA maps. The TBSS technique projects the FA data into a common space through the use of an initial approximate nonlinear registration, followed by projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (mean FA skeleton). The cluster results were corrected for multiple comparisons across space, and a threshold of significance of 0.05 was used.; Results. The white matter of tracts in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the fasciculus uncinatus, as well as the fornix, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (corticospinal tract), and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (anterior thalamic radiation) of patients with SLE showed reduced integrity as compared with normal subjects.; Conclusion. In this preliminary study, the integrity of white matter tracts in areas around limbic structures and in the internal capsule was found to be reduced. Larger studies could improve our understanding of the pathologic mechanisms behind the reduced white matter tract integrity in SLE.

N2  -  Imaging of brain metastases (BMs) has advanced greatly over the past decade. In this review, we discuss the main challenges that BMs pose in clinical practice and describe the role of imaging.
Firstly, we describe the increased incidence of BMs of different primary tumours and the rationale for screening. A challenge lies in selecting the right patients for screening: not all cancer patients develop BMs in their disease course. Secondly, we discuss the imaging techniques to detect BMs. A three-dimensional (3D) T1W MRI sequence is the golden standard for BM detection, but additional anatomical (susceptibility weighted imaging, diffusion weighted imaging), functional (perfusion MRI) and metabolic (MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography) information can help to differentiate BMs from other intracranial aetiologies.; Thirdly, we describe the role of imaging before, during and after treatment of BMs. For surgical resection, imaging is used to select surgical patients, but also to assist intraoperatively (neuronavigation, fluorescence-guided surgery, ultrasound). For treatment planning of stereotactic radiosurgery, MRI is combined with CT. For surveillance after both local and systemic therapies, conventional MRI is used. However, advanced imaging is increasingly performed to distinguish true tumour progression from pseudoprogression.; FInally, future perspectives are discussed, including radiomics, new biomarkers, new endogenous contrast agents and theranostics.

N2  -  Auditory word comprehension is a cognitive process that involves the transformation of auditory signals into abstract concepts. Traditional lesion-based studies of stroke survivors with aphasia have suggested that neocortical regions adjacent to auditory cortex are primarily responsible for word comprehension. However, recent primary progressive aphasia and normal neurophysiological studies have challenged this concept, suggesting that the left temporal pole is crucial for word comprehension. Due to its vasculature, the temporal pole is not commonly completely lesioned in stroke survivors and this heterogeneity may have prevented its identification in lesion-based studies of auditory comprehension. We aimed to resolve this controversy using a combined voxel-based- and structural connectome-lesion symptom mapping approach, since cortical dysfunction after stroke can arise from cortical damage or from white matter disconnection. Magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging-based structural connectome), auditory word comprehension and object recognition tests were obtained from 67 chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors. We observed that damage to the inferior temporal gyrus, to the fusiform gyrus and to a white matter network including the left posterior temporal region and its connections to the middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and cingulate cortex, was associated with word comprehension difficulties after factoring out object recognition. These results suggest that the posterior lateral and inferior temporal regions are crucial for word comprehension, serving as a hub to integrate auditory and conceptual processing. Early processing linking auditory words to concepts is situated in posterior lateral temporal regions, whereas additional and deeper levels of semantic processing likely require more anterior temporal regions.

N2  -  Structural MRI, electrophysiology, and functional MRI (fMRI) elucidate different aspects of damage and repair in demyelinating diseases. We combined them to investigate why patients with optic neuritis (ON) exhibit a wide variation in severity of acute visual loss, with the following objectives: (1) To determine how structural and electrophysiological changes in the anterior and posterior visual pathways contribute to acute visual loss. (2) To combine these data with fMRI, to investigate whether cortical activity modulates visual acuity. The visual system of 28 patients with acute unilateral ON was assessed. Linear regression modeling was used to identify parameters associated with acute visual loss, and to determine whether fMRI activity was associated with vision, after accounting for structural and electrophysiological predictors, age, and gender. Optic nerve lesion length and visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitude were associated with visual loss. Bilateral activation in the extra-striate occipital cortex correlated directly with vision, after adjusting for optic nerve lesion length, VEP amplitude, and demographic characteristics. These data suggest that acute visual loss is associated with the extent of inflammation and conduction block in the optic nerve, but not with pathology in the optic radiations or occipital cortex. The association of better vision with greater fMRI responses, after accounting for factors which reduce afferent input, suggests a role for adaptive neuroplasticity within the association cortex of the dorsal stream of higher visual processing. Longitudinal studies will clarify whether different extra-striate cortical regions play a role in adaptive plasticity in the acute and chronic stages of injury. Hum Brain Mapp 31:276-286, 2010.

N2  -  BackgroundRelative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) obtained from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is widely used to distinguish high grade glioma recurrence from post treatment radiation effects (PTRE). Application of rCBV thresholds yield maps to distinguish between regional tumor burden and PTRE, a biomarker termed the fractional tumor burden (FTB). FTB is generally measured using conventional double-dose, single-echo DSC-MRI protocols; recently, a single-dose, dual-echo DSC-MRI protocol was clinically validated by direct comparison to the conventional double-dose, single-echo protocol. As the single-dose, dual-echo acquisition enables reduction in the contrast agent dose and provides greater pulse sequence parameter flexibility, there is a compelling need to establish dual-echo DSC-MRI based FTB mapping. In this study, we determine the optimum standardized rCBV threshold for the single-dose, dual-echo protocol to generate FTB maps that best match those derived from the reference standard, double-dose, single-echo protocol. MethodsThe study consisted of 23 high grade glioma patients undergoing perfusion scans to confirm suspected tumor recurrence. We sequentially acquired single dose, dual-echo and double dose, single-echo DSC-MRI data. For both protocols, we generated leakage-corrected standardized rCBV maps. Standardized rCBV (sRCBV) thresholds of 1.0 and 1.75 were used to compute single-echo FTB maps as the reference for delineating PTRE (sRCBV < 1.0), tumor with moderate angiogenesis (1.0 < sRCBV < 1.75), and tumor with high angiogenesis (sRCBV > 1.75) regions. To assess the sRCBV agreement between acquisition protocols, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed between the mean tumor sRCBV values across the patients. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimum dual-echo sRCBV threshold. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared between the obtained optimized threshold (1.64) and the standard reference threshold (1.75) for the dual-echo sRCBV threshold. ResultsThe mean tumor sRCBV values across the patients showed a strong correlation (CCC = 0.96) between the two protocols. The ROC analysis showed maximum accuracy at thresholds of 1.0 (delineate PTRE from tumor) and 1.64 (differentiate aggressive tumors). The reference threshold (1.75) and the obtained optimized threshold (1.64) yielded similar accuracy, with slight differences in sensitivity and specificity which were not statistically significant (1.75 threshold: Sensitivity = 81.94%; Specificity: 87.23%; Accuracy: 84.58% and 1.64 threshold: Sensitivity = 84.48%; Specificity: 84.97%; Accuracy: 84.73%). ConclusionsThe optimal sRCBV threshold for single-dose, dual-echo protocol was found to be 1.0 and 1.64 for distinguishing tumor recurrence from PTRE; however, minimal differences were observed when using the standard threshold (1.75) as the upper threshold, suggesting that the standard threshold could be used for both protocols. While the prior study validated the agreement of the mean sRCBV values between the protocols, this study confirmed that their voxel-wise agreement is suitable for reliable FTB mapping. Dual-echo DSC-MRI acquisitions enable robust single-dose sRCBV and FTB mapping, provide pulse sequence parameter flexibility and should improve reproducibility by mitigating variations in preload dose and incubation time.

N2  -  Introduction: Angiotropic lymphoma is a rare large B-cell lymphoma involving the intravascular compartment without local tissue or vessel wall infiltration.
Case Report: A 48-year-old male presented with 8 months of progressive paraparesis and bowel and bladder incontinence. Initial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed high protein, lymphocytic pleocytosis, high IgG synthesis, but no oligoclonal bands. Brain imaging at presentation was unrevealing. Electromyography revealed evidence of bilateral lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy R > L. A trial of intravenous solumedrol resulted in significant improvement in weakness. He had multiple hospital admissions for worsening lower extremity weakness, altered mental status, and new-onset upper extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed abnormal hyper-intense T2 signal at T7-T8 level. Visual-evoked potentials revealed significant slowing of conduction in both optic nerves. Repeat electromyography showed a moderate to severe motor axonal polyneuropathy with secondary demyelination in the upper and lower extremities. A working diagnosis of encephalomyeloradiculoneuritis was made because of signs of polyradiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy. Patient had 3 trials of intravenous solumedrol with transient improvement in symptoms. The magnetic resonance imaging brain on his sixth hospital admission revealed multiple areas of restricted diffusion throughout the brain parenchyma. The patient underwent a right frontal lobe biopsy, which showed large CD-20(+) neoplastic lymphocytes within small arteries, veins, and capillaries with no extension to surrounding brain parenchyma. The findings were consistent with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.; Conclusion: Angiotropic lymphoma is a rare disease with frequent involvement of central nervous system and skin that can present with neurological involvement of both the peripheral and central nervous system.

N2  -  Objective: To assess the relationship between cognition and brain white matter (WM) lesion distribution and frequency in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS).
Methods: MRI-based T2 lesion probability map (LPM) was used to assess the relevance of brain lesion location for cognitive impairment in a group of 142 consecutive patients with RRMS. Significance of voxelwise analyses was p<0.05, cluster-corrected for multiple comparisons. The Rao Brief Repeatable Battery was administered at the time of brain MRI to categorize the MS population into cognitively preserved (CP) and cognitively impaired (CI).; Results: Out of 142 RRMS, 106 were classified as CP and 36 as CI. Although the CI group had greater WM lesion volume than the CP group (p = 0.001), T2 lesions tended to be less widespread across the WM. The peak of lesion frequency was almost twice higher in CI (61% in the forceps major) than in CP patients (37% in the posterior corona radiata). The voxelwise analysis confirmed that lesion frequency was higher in CI than in CP patients with significant bilateral clusters in the forceps major and in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p<0.05, corrected). Low scores of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test correlated with higher lesion frequency in these WM regions.; Conclusions: Overall these results suggest that in MS patients, areas relevant for cognition lie mostly in the commissural fiber tracts. This supports the notion of a functional (multiple) disconnection between grey matter structures, secondary to damage located in specific WM areas, as one of the most important mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment in MS.

N2  -  Electrical stimulation of the mandibular canine tooth pulp in barbiturate-anesthetized cats activated myelinated A-.beta.-fibers in the inferior alveolar (dental) nerve and evoked a complex pattern of short-latency potentials that were recorded epidurally from the cortex. Three far-field components (FFP designated I, IIa,b, and IIa,b) and 2 early near-field components (ENFP designated P1 and N1) were identified from computer-averaged potentials recorded over the contralateral lateral sigmoid gyrus or ipsilateral presylvian/anterior coronal gyri. Several corroborative lines of evidence indicated that tooth pup-evoked FFP and ENFP originate from the following genrator sources: I, inferior alveolar (dental) nerve/semilunar (gasserian) ganglion; IIa,b, trigeminal lemniscal fibers from the principal (main) sensory nucleus; IIIa,b, thalamocortical fibers from the thalamic ventral postereomedial nucelus; P1, N1, cytoarchitectural area 3 on the banks of the coronal or orbital sulcus. The latencies and waveforms of volume-conducted, surface-recorded potentials were not significantly different from those recorded at putative generator sites along the trigeminal lemniscal projection system. The short latencies and distribution of surface- and depth- recorded tooth pulp-evoked potentials suggested bilateral, trisynaptic paths from peripheral nerve to cortical neurons. Amplitude measurements of FFP and ENFP recorded at the cortical, epidural surface were compared to calculated values based on a mathematical model of 2 concentric spheres of inhomogeneous media in which a single equivalent dipole is radially oriented at some distance from the center. The morphology and distribution of FFP and ENFP are discussed in relationship to source geometry. Surface- and depth-recorded tooth pulp-evoked potentials had recovery functions that were covariant with rates of stimulation. In addition, stimulation of putative generator sites along the trigeminal lemniscal system reproduced portions of the tooth pulp-evoked surface-recorded potentials. Selective ablation of trigeminal cortical area 3 abolished ENFP and lesions of lemniscal brain stem sites abolished FFP. Disruption of extralemniscal brain stem sites had no effect on the surface-recorded evoked potentials examined. These findings and other supporting evidence from previous studies imply that the projection of fast-conducting tooth pulp input to the cortex may subserve a nonnociceptive modality and participate in sensorimotor integration.

N2  -  Biomathematical modeling of glioma growth has been developed to optimize treatments delivery and to evaluate their efficacy. Simulations currently make use of anatomical knowledge from standard MRI atlases. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces are obtained by automatic thresholding of the MNI atlas, leading to an approximate representation of real anatomy. To correct such inaccuracies, an expert-revised CSF segmentation map of the MNI atlas was built. Several virtual glioma growth patterns of different locations were generated, with and without using the expert-revised version of the MNI atlas. The adequacy between virtual and radiologically observed growth patterns was clearly higher when simulations were based on the expert-revised atlas. This work emphasizes the need for close collaboration between clinicians and researchers in the field of brain tumor modeling.

N2  -  Chronic aphasia is a common consequence of a left-hemisphere stroke. Since the early insights by Broca and Wemicke, studying the relationship between the loci of cortical damage and patterns of language impairment has been one of the concerns of aphasiology. We utilized multivariate classification in a cross-validation framework to predict the type of chronic aphasia from the spatial pattern of brain damage. Our sample consisted of 98 patients with five types of aphasia (Broca's, Wernicke's, global, conduction, and anomic), classified based on scores on the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). Binary lesion maps were obtained from structural MRI scans (obtained at least 6 months poststroke, and within 2 days of behavioural assessment); after spatial normalization, the lesions were parcellated into a disjoint set of brain areas. The proportion of damage to the brain areas was used to classify patients aphasia type. To create this parcellation, we relied on five brain atlases; our classifier (support vector machine SVM) could differentiate between different kinds of aphasia using any of the five parcellations. In our sample, the best classification accuracy was obtained when using a novel parcellation that combined two previously published brain atlases, with the first atlas providing the segmentation of grey matter, and the second atlas used to segment the white matter. For each aphasia type, we computed the relative importance of different brain areas for distinguishing it from other aphasia types; our findings were consistent with previously published reports of lesion locations implicated in different types of aphasia. Overall, our results revealed that automated multivariate classification could distinguish between aphasia types based on damage to atlasdefined brain areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Quantitative MRI methods have recently gained extensive interest and are seeing substantial developments; however, their application in single patient vs control group comparisons is often limited by inherent statistical difficulties. One such application is detecting malformations of cortical development (MCDs) behind drug resistant epilepsies, a task that, especially when based solely on conventional MR images, may represent a serious challenge. We aimed to develop a novel straightforward voxel-wise evaluation method based on the Mahalanobis-distance, combining quantitative MRI data into a multidimensional parameter space and detecting lesion voxels as outliers. Simulations with standard multivariate Gaussian distribution and resampled DTI-eigenvalue data of 45 healthy control subjects determined the optimal critical value, cluster size threshold, and the expectable lesion detection performance through ROC-analyses. To reduce the effect of false positives emanating from registration artefacts and gyrification differences, an automatic classification method was applied, fine-tuned using a leave-one-out strategy based on diffusion and T1-weighted data of the controls. DWI processing, including thorough corrections and robust tensor fitting was performed with ExploreDTI, spatial coregistration was achieved with the DARTEL tools of SPM12. Additional to simulations, clusters of outlying diffusion profile, concordant with neuroradiological evaluation and independent calculations with the MAP07 toolbox were identified in 12 cases of a 13 patient example population with various types of MCDs. The multidimensional approach proved sufficiently sensitive in pinpointing regions of abnormal tissue microstructure using DTI data both in simulations and in the heterogeneous example population. Inherent limitations posed by registration artefacts, age-related differences, and the different or mixed pathologies limit the generalization of specificity estimation. Nevertheless, the proposed statistical method may aid the everyday examination of individual subjects, ever so more upon extending the framework with quantitative information from other modalities, e.g. susceptibility mapping, relaxometry, or perfusion.

N2  -  Background and PurposeMalignant cerebral edema (MCE) secondary to ischemic stroke is a highly morbid condition. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the only treatment for MCE that has been shown to reduce mortality. We examined whether early infarction and/or hypoperfusion in specific topographic regions was predictive of the need for later DC. MethodsA retrospective database of patients evaluated for large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke at Stanford between 2010 and 2019 was used. Thirty patients with LVO and baseline perfusion MRI who underwent DC were evaluated. Propensity matching based on age, lesion size, and recanalization status was performed on the remaining cohort. Baseline masks of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) + T-max >6 seconds lesions were generated using automated perfusion software. Voxel-based lesion symptom maping was used to perform logistic regression at each voxel to generate statistical maps of lesion location associated with DC. Hemispheres were combined to increase statistical power. ResultsSixty patients were analyzed. After adjusting for age, lesion size, and recanalization status as covariates, scattered cortical regions, predominately within the temporal and frontal lobe, were mildly to moderately predictive of the need for DC (z-scores: 2.4-6.74, p < .01). ConclusionsScattered temporal and frontal lobe regions on baseline diffusion and perfusion MRI were found to be mildly to moderately predictive of the need for subsequent DC in patients with LVO stroke.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) preferred to infiltrate into white matter (WM) be-yond the recognizable tumor margin.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether fiber density (FD) and structural brain connectome can provide meaningful information about WM destruction and glioma cell infiltration. METHODS: GBM cases were collected based on inclusion criteria, and baseline information and preoperative MRI results were obtained. GBM lesions were automatically segmented into necrosis, contrast-enhanced tumor, and edema areas. We obtained the FD map to compute the FD and lnFD values in each subarea and reconstructed the structural brain connectome to obtain the topological metrics in each subarea. We also divided the edema area into a nonenhanced tumor (NET) area and a normal WM area based on the contralesional lnFD value in the edema area, and computed the NET ratio.RESULTS: Twenty-five GBM cases were included in this retrospective study. The FD/lnFD value and topological metrics (aCp, aLp, aEg, aEloc, and ar) were significantly correlated with GBM subareas, which represented the extent of WM destruction and glioma cell infiltration. The FD/lnFD values and topological parameters were correlated with the NET ratio. In particular, the lnFD value in the edema area was correlated with the NET ratio (coefficient, 0.92). Therefore, a larger lnFD value indicates more severe glioma infiltration in the edema area and suggests an extended resection for better clinical outcomes.CONCLUSION: The FD and structural brain connectome in this study provide a new insight into glioma infiltration and a different consideration of their clinical application in neuro-oncology.

N2  -  IntroductionPost-stroke fatigue is frequently present in young adults, but its underlying mechanism is still unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between lesion location, network efficiency and chronic post-stroke fatigue based on voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and structural network connectivity analysis. Patients and MethodsOne hundred and thirty five young patients, aged 18-50 years, with a first-ever transient ischemic attack or cerebral infarction from the Follow-Up of Transient ischemic attack and stroke patients and Unelucidated Risk factor Evaluation (FUTURE) study, underwent 1.5T MRI and were assessed for fatigue using the self-report Checklist Individual Strength. Stroke lesions were manually segmented, and structural network efficiency was calculated using the diffusion MRI-based brain networks and graph theory for each patient. Univariate and multivariate analyses was performed to study the associations between MRI parameters and chronic post-stroke fatigue. In addition, we used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to analyze the relationship between the lesion location and chronic post-stroke fatigue. ResultsMean age at index event was 39.0 years (SD +/- 8.2), and mean follow-up duration was 11.0 years (SD +/- 8.0). 50 patients (37%) had post-stroke fatigue. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping showed no significant relation between stroke lesions and the presence of chronic post-stroke fatigue. Furthermore, there were no significant associations between the lesion size or network efficiency, and the presence of chronic post-stroke fatigue. DiscussionWe did not find any association between stroke characteristics (lesion location and size) and chronic post-stroke fatigue (CIS20-R), nor associations between structural brain network connectivity and post-stroke fatigue on the long term in young stroke patients.

N2  -  We present an application of a previously developed agent-based glioma model (Chen et al 2009 Biosystems 95 234-42) for predicting spatio-temporal tumor progression using a patient-specific MRI lattice derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) data. Agents representing collections of migrating glioma cells are initialized based upon voxels at the outer border of the tumor identified on T1-weighted (Gd+) MRI at an initial time point. These simulated migratory cells exhibit a specific biologically inspired spatial search paradigm, representing a weighting of the differential contribution from haptotactic permission and biomechanical resistance on the migration decision process. ADC data from 9 months after the initial tumor resection were used to select the best search paradigm for the simulation, which was initiated using data from 6 months after the initial operation. Using this search paradigm, 100 simulations were performed to derive a probabilistic map of tumor invasion locations. The simulation was able to successfully predict a recurrence in the dorsal/posterior aspect long before it was depicted on T1-weighted MRI, 18 months after the initial operation.

N2  -  In the past, changes of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in glioblastoma multiforme have been shown to be related to specific genes and described as being associated with survival. The purpose of this study was to investigate diffusion imaging parameters in combination with genome-wide expression data in order to obtain a comprehensive characterisation of the transcriptomic changes indicated by diffusion imaging parameters. Diffusion-weighted imaging, molecular and clinical data were collected prospectively in 21 patients. Before surgery, MRI diffusion metrics such as axial (AD), radial (RD), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assessed from the contrast enhancing tumour regions. Intraoperatively, tissue was sampled from the same areas using neuronavigation. Transcriptional data of the tissue samples was analysed by Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) thus classifying genes into modules based on their network-based affiliations. Subsequent Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified biological functions or pathways of the expression modules. Network analysis showed a strong association between FA and epithelial-to-mesenchymal- transition (EMT) pathway activation. Also, patients with high FA had a worse clinical outcome. MD correlated with neural function related genes and patients with high MD values had longer overall survival. In conclusion, FA and MD are associated with distinct molecular patterns and opposed clinical outcomes.

N2  -  We combined tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging to assess white matter (WM) tract-specific short-term changes in early primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and their relationships with clinical progression. Twenty-one PPMS patients within 5 years from onset underwent MT and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at baseline and after 12 months. Patients' disability was assessed. DTI data were processed to compute fractional anisotropy (FA) and to generate a common WM skeleton, which represents the tracts that are common to all subjects using TBSS. The MT ratio (MTR) was computed from MT data and co-registered with the DTI. The skeletonization procedure derived for FA was applied to each subject's MTR image to obtain a skeletonised MTR map for every subject. Permutation tests were used to assess (i) changes in FA, principal diffusivities, and MTR over the follow-up, and (ii) associations between changes in imaging parameters and changes in disability. Patients showed significant decreases in MTR over one year in the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral corticospinal tract (CST), thalamic radiations, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. These changes were located both within lesions and the normal-appearing WM. No significant longitudinal change in skeletonised FA was found, but radial diffusivity (RD) significantly increased in several regions, including the CST bilaterally and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. MTR decreases, RD increases, and axial diffusivity decreases in the CC and CST correlated with a deterioration in the upper limb function. We detected tract-specific multimodal imaging changes that reflect the accrual of microstructural damage and possibly contribute to clinical impairment in PPMS. We propose a novel methodology that can be extended to other diseases to map cross-subject and tract-specific changes in MTR. Hum Brain Mapp 35:723-733, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T2  -  SURGERY SIMULATION AND SOFT TISSUE MODELING, PROCEEDINGS

N2  -  A critical challenge for the neurosurgeon during surgery is to be able to preserve healthy tissue and minimize the disruption of critical anatomical structures while at the same time removing as much tumor tissue as possible. Over the past several years we have developed intraoperative image processing algorithms with the goal of augmenting the surgeon's capacity to achieve maximal tumor resection while minimizing the disruption to normal tissue. The brain of the patient often changes shape in a nonrigid fashion over the course of a surgery, due to loss of cerebrospinal fluid, concomitant pressure changes, the impact of anaesthetics and the surgical resection itself. This further increases the challenge of visualizing and navigating critical brain structures. The primary concept of our approach is to exploit intraoperative image acquisition to directly visualize the morphology of brain as it changes over the course of the surgery, and to enhance the surgeon's capacity to visualize critical structures by projecting extensive preoperative data into the intraoperative configuration of the patient's brain.
Our approach to tracking brain changes during neurosurgery has been previously described. We identify key structures in volumetric preoperative and intraoperative scans, and use the constraints provided by the matching of these key surfaces to compute a biomechanical simulation of the volumetric brain deformation. The recovered volumetric deformation field can then be applied to preoperative data sets, such as functional MRI (fMRI) or diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) in order to warp this data into the new configuration of the patient's brain. In recent work we have constructed visualizations of preoperative fMRI and DT-MRI, and intraoperative MRI showing a close correspondence between the matched data. A further challenge of intraoperative image processing is that augmented visualizations must be presented to the neurosurgeon at a rate compatible with surgical decision making. We have previously demonstrated our biomechanical simulation of brain deformation can be executed entirely during neurosurgery. We used a generic atlas to provide surrogate information regarding the expected location of critical anatomical structures, and were able to project this data to match the patient and to display the matched data to the neurosurgeon during the surgical procedure. The use of patient-specific DTI and fMRI preoperative data significantly improves the localization of critical structures. The augmented visualization of intraoperative data with relevant preoperative data can significantly enhance the information available to the neurosurgeon.

T2  -  DIAGNOSTICS

N2  -  A 54-year-old male suffered from direct head trauma resulting from a fall while working. At approximately two months after the accident, he began to feel pain (burning sensation) and swelling of the dorsum of the right hand and wrist. He showed the following clinical features among the clinical signs and symptoms of revised diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS): spontaneous pain, mechanical hyperalgesia, vasodilation, skin temperature asymmetries, skin color changes, swelling, motor weakness. No specific lesion was observed on brain MRI taken at ten weeks after onset. Plain X-ray, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies for the right upper extremity detected no abnormality. A three-phase bone scan showed hot uptake in the right wrist in the delayed image. On two-month diffusion tensor tractography, partial tearing of the corticospinal tract (CST) was observed at the subcortical white matter in both hemispheres (much more severe in the left CST). In addition, the fiber number of the right CST was significantly decreased than that of seven normal control subjects. CRPS I of the right hand in this patient appeared to be related to traumatic axonal injury of the left CST following mild traumatic brain injury.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Axonal injury is a key player of disability in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Yet, detecting and measuring it in vivo is challenging. The neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) proposes a novel framework for probing axonal integrity in vivo. NODDI at 3.0 Tesla was used to quantify tissue damage in pwMS and its relationship with disease progression.
Methods Eighteen pwMS (4 clinically isolated syndrome, 11 relapsing remitting, and 3 secondary progressive MS) and nine age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a brain MRI, inclusive of clinical sequences and a multi-shell diffusion acquisition. Parametric maps of axial diffusivity (AD), neurite density index (ndi), apparent isotropic volume fraction (ivf), and orientation dispersion index (odi) were fitted. Anatomically matched regions of interest were used to quantify AD and NODDI-derived metrics and to assess the relations between these measures and those of disease progression.; Results AD, ndi, ivf, and odi significantly differed between chronic black holes (cBHs) and T2-lesions, and between the latter and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). All metrics except ivf significantly differed between NAWM located next to a cBH and that situated contra-laterally. Only NAWM odi was significantly associated with T2-lesion volume, the timed 25-foot walk test and disease duration.; Conclusions NODDI is sensitive to tissue injury but its relationship with clinical progression remains limited.

N2  -  Background. High-grade gliomas with mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene family confer longer overall survival relative to their IDH-wild-type counterparts. Accurate determination of the IDH genotype preoperatively may have both prognostic and diagnostic value. The current study used a machine-learning algorithm to generate a model predictive of IDH genotype in high-grade gliomas based on clinical variables and multimodal features extracted from conventional MRI.
Methods. Preoperative MRIs were obtained for 120 patients with primary grades III (n = 35) and IV (n = 85) glioma in this retrospective study. IDH genotype was confirmed for grade III (3235, 91%) and IV (2285, 26%) tumors by immunohistochemistry, spectrometry-based mutation genotyping (OncoMap), or multiplex exome sequencing (OncoPanel). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive, and all mutated tumors were collapsed into one IDH-mutated cohort. Cases were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 90) or validation cohort (n = 30). A total of 2970 imaging features were extracted from pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient map. Using a random forest algorithm, nonredundant features were integrated with clinical data to generate a model predictive of IDH genotype.; Results. Our model achieved accuracies of 86% (area under the curve AUC = 0.8830) in the training cohort and 89% (AUC = 0.9231) in the validation cohort. Features with the highest predictive value included patient age as well as parametric intensity, texture, and shape features.; Conclusion. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we achieved accurate prediction of IDH genotype in high-grade gliomas with preoperative clinical and MRI features.

N2  -  The m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the cerebral cortex has traditionally been thought of as an autoreceptor located on cholinergic fibers that originate from neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. We now provide evidence for widespread localization of the m2 receptor in noncholinergic neurons and fibers of the cerebral cortex. The cellular and subcellular distribution of the m2 receptor protein and mRNA were examined in normal monkeys and in monkeys in which the cortical cholinergic afferents were selectively lesioned by injection of the specific immunotoxin, anti-p75(NTR)-saporin into the nucleus basalis. Both in normal and immunolesioned monkeys, the m2 mRNA and protein were localized in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons. In pyramidal neurons, membrane-associated receptor immunoreactivity was found exclusively in dendritic spines receiving asymmetric synapses, indicating that the m2 receptor may modulate excitatory neurotransmission at these sites. In nonpyramidal neurons, the m2 immunoreactivity was present along the cytoplasmic surface of membranes in cell bodies, dendrites and axons. Both in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons of normal and lesioned monkeys, the m2 receptor was located peri-and extra-synaptically, suggesting that it may be contacted by acetylcholine via volume transmission. The localization of the m2 receptor in cortical neurons and the sparing of m2 immunoreactivity in lesioned monkeys indicates that the m2 receptor is synthesized largely within the cortex and/or is localized to noncholinergic terminals of either intrinsic or extrinsic origin. These findings open the possibility that the loss of the m2 receptor in Alzheimer's disease may in part be due to degenerative changes in m2 positive neurons of the cortex rather than entirely due to the loss of autoreceptors.

N2  -  Introduction We describe the imaging findings encountered in GBM patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade and assess the potential of quantitative MRI biomarkers to differentiate patients who derive therapeutic benefit from those who do not.
Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on longitudinal MRIs obtained on recurrent GBM patients enrolled on clinical trials. Among 10 patients with analyzable data, bidirectional diameters were measured on contrast enhanced T1 (pGd-T1WI) and volumes of interest (VOI) representing measurable abnormality suggestive of tumor were selected on pGdT1WI (pGdT1 VOI), FLAIR-T2WI (FLAIR VOI), and ADC maps. Intermediate ADC (IADC) VOI represented voxels within the FLAIR VOI having ADC in the range of highly cellular tumor (0.7-1.1 x 10(-3) mm(2)s) (IADC VOI). Therapeutic benefit was determined by tissue pathology and survival on trial. IADC VOI, pGdT1 VOI, FLAIR VOI, and RANO assessment results were correlated with patient benefit.; Results Five patients were deemed to have received therapeutic benefit and the other five patients did not. The average time on trial for the benefit group was 194 days, as compared to 81 days for the no benefit group. IADC VOI correlated well with the presence or absence of clinical benefit in 10 patients. Furthermore, pGd VOI, FLAIR VOI, and RANO assessment correlated less well with response.; Conclusion MRI reveals an initial increase in volumes of abnormal tissue with contrast enhancement, edema, and intermediate ADC suggesting hypercellularity within the first 06 months of immunotherapy. Subsequent stabilization and improvement in IADC VOI appear to better predict ultimate therapeutic benefit from these agents than conventional imaging.

N2  -  Objective: The objective was to evaluate diagnostic performance of dynamic susceptibility-contrast perfusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and glioblastoma.
Materials and methods: Twenty-three glioblastomas and 11 PCNSLs were analyzed with uncorrected cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio, fifth percentile value of cumulative apparent diffusion coefficient histogram (ADC(5%)), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) using regions of interest created semiautomatically on enhancing areas.; Results: Uncorrected CBV ratio was highly capable of differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma, as well as SUVmax and ADC(5%).; Conclusions: Uncorrected CBV ratio demonstrates high diagnostic performance comparable to SUVmax.

N2  -  Stimulating the brain to drive its adaptive plastic potential is promising to accelerate rehabilitative outcomes in stroke. The ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) is invariably facilitated. However, evidence supporting its efficacy is divided, indicating that we may have overgeneralized its potential. Since the M1 and its corticospinal output are frequently damaged in patients with serious lesions and impairments, ipsilesional premotor areas (PMAs) could be useful alternates instead. We base our premise on their higher probability of survival, greater descending projections, and adaptive potential, which is causal for recovery across the seriously impaired. Using a conceptual model, we describe how chronically stimulating PMAs would strongly affect key mechanisms of stroke motor recovery, such as facilitating the plasticity of alternate descending output, restoring interhemispheric balance, and establishing widespread connectivity. Although at this time it is difficult to predict whether PMAs would be better, it is important to at least investigate whether they are reasonable substitutes for the M1. Even if the stimulation of the M1 may benefit those with maximum recovery potential, while that of PMAs may only help the more disadvantaged, it may still be reasonable to achieve some recovery across the majority rather than stimulate a single locus fated to be inconsistently effective across all.

N2  -  Executive functions are high-level cognitive processes involving abilities such as working memory/updating, set-shifting and inhibition. These complex cognitive functions are enabled by interactions among widely distributed cognitive networks, supported by white matter tracts. Executive impairment is frequent in neurological conditions affecting white matter; however, whether specific tracts are crucial for normal executive functions is unclear. We review causal and correlation evidence from studies that used direct electrical stimulation during awake surgery for gliomas, voxel-based and tract-based lesion-symptom mapping, and diffusion tensor imaging to explore associations between the integrity of white matter tracts and executive functions in healthy and impaired adults. The corpus callosum was consistently associated with all executive processes, notably its anterior segments. Both causal and correlation evidence showed prominent support of the superior longitudinal fasciculus to executive functions, notably to working memory. More specifically, strong evidence suggested that the second branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus is crucial for all executive functions, especially for flexibility. Global results showed left lateralization for verbal tasks and right lateralization for executive tasks with visual demands. The frontal aslant tract potentially supports executive functions, however, additional evidence is needed to clarify whether its involvement in executive tasks goes beyond the control of language. Converging evidence indicates that a right-lateralized network of tracts connecting cortical and subcortical grey matter regions supports the performance of tasks assessing response inhibition, some suggesting a role for the right anterior thalamic radiation. Finally, correlation evidence suggests a role for the cingulum bundle in executive functions, especially in tasks assessing inhibition. We discuss these findings in light of current knowledge about the functional role of these tracts, descriptions of the brain networks supporting executive functions and clinical implications for individuals with brain tumours.
Ribeiro et al. review evidence from studies exploring associations between the integrity of white matter tracts and executive function in healthy and impaired adults. Causal and correlation evidence shows prominent involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus in all executive domains.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate differences in lesions and surrounding normal appearing white matter (NAWM) by perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with acute and chronic ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis (MS).
Methods: Study subjects included 45 MS patients, 22 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 20 patients with chronic ischemic stroke. All subjects underwent T(2)-weighted imaging (WI), flair attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), DWI and dynamic contrast enhanced PWI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and mean transit time (MTT) maps were generated and values were calculated in the acute and chronic ischemic and demyelinating lesions, and in NAWM for distances of 5, 10 and 15 mm. Fifty-three acute ischemic and 33 acute demyelinating lesions, and 775 chronic ischemic and 998 chronic demyelinating lesions, were examined. Univariate, multivariate and data mining analyses were used to examine the feasibility of a prediction model between different lesion types. Correctly and incorrectly classified lesions, true positive (TP), false positive (FP) and precision rates were calculated.; Results: Patients with acute ischemic lesions presented more prolonged mean MTT values in lesions (p = 0.002) and surrounding NAWM for distances of 5, 10 and 15 mm (all p < 0.0001) than those with acute demyelinating lesions. In multinomial logistic regression analysis, 65 of 86 acute lesions were correctly classified (75.6%). The TP rates were 81.1% for acute ischemic lesions and 66.7% for acute demyelinating lesions. The FP rates were 33.3% for acute ischemic and 18.9% for acute demyelinating lesions. The precision was 79.6% for classification of acute ischemic lesions and 68.8% for prediction of acute demyelinating lesions. The logistic model tree decision algorithm revealed that prolonged MTT of surrounding NAWM for a distance of 15 mm (>= 7459.2 ms) was the best classifier of acute ischemic versus acute demyelinating lesions. Patients with chronic ischemic lesions presented higher mean ADC (p, 0.0001) and prolonged MTT (p = 0.013) in lesions, and in surrounding NAWM for distances of 5, 10 and 15 mm (all p < 0.0001), compared to the patients with chronic demyelinating lesions. Data mining analyses did not show reliable predictability for correctly discerning between chronic ischemic and chronic demyelinating lesions. The precision was 56.7% for classification of chronic ischemic and 58.9% for prediction of chronic demyelinating lesions.; Discussion: We found prolonged MTT values in lesions and surrounding NAWM of patients with acute and chronic ischemic stroke when compared to MS patients. The use of PWI is a promising tool for differential diagnosis between acute ischemic and acute demyelinating lesions. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the extent of hemodynamic abnormalities in lesions and surrounding NAWM in patients with MS. Neurol Res 2008; 30: 816-826

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The tissue selectivity of pulsed field ablation (PFA) provides safety advantages over radiofrequency ablation in treating atrial fibrillation. One-shot PFA catheters have been shown capable of performing pulmonary vein isolation, but not flexible lesion sets such as linear lesions. A novel lattice-tip ablation catheter with a compressible 9-mm nitinol tip is able to deliver either focal radiofrequency ablation or PFA lesions, each in 2 to 5 s.
METHODS: In a 3-center, single-arm, first-in-human trial, the 7.5F lattice catheter was used with a custom mapping system to treat paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Toggling between energy sources, point-by-point pulmonary vein encirclement was performed using biphasic PFA posteriorly and either temperature-controlled irrigated radiofrequency ablation or PFA anteriorly (RFPF or PFPF, respectively). Linear lesions were created using either PFA or radiofrequency ablation.; RESULTS: The 76-patient cohort included 55 paroxysmal and 21 persistent atrial fibrillation patients undergoing either RFPF (40 patients) or PFPF (36 patients) ablation. The pulmonary vein isolation therapy duration time (transpiring from first to last lesion) was 22.6 +- 8.3 minpatient, with a mean of 50.1 RFPF lesionspatient. Linear lesions included 14 mitral (4 RF2 RF+PF8 PF), 34 left atrium roof (12 RF22 PF), and 44 cavotricuspid isthmus (36 RF8 PF) lines, with therapy duration times of 5.1 +- 3.5, 1.8 +- 2.3, and 2.4 +- 2.1 minpatient, respectively. All lesion sets were acutely successful, using 4.7 +- 3.5 minutes of fluoroscopy. There were no device-related complications, including no strokes. Postprocedure esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed minor mucosal thermal injury in 2 of 36 RFPF and 0 of 24 PFPF patients. Postprocedure brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffusion-weighted imaging+fluid-attenuated inversion recovery- and diffusion-weighted imaging+fluid-attenuated inversion recovery+ asymptomatic lesions in 5 and 3 of 51 patients, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: A novel lattice-tip catheter could safely and rapidly ablate atrial fibrillation using either a combined RFPF approach (capitalizing on the safety of PFA and the years of experience with radiofrequency energy) or an entirely PF approach.

N2  -  Recently, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has also been demonstrated as an imaging tool for applications in neurological and neurovascular diseases. However, the use of single-shot diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging for IVIM DWI acquisition leads to suboptimal data quality: for instance, geometric distortion and deteriorated image quality at high spatial resolution. Although the recently commercialized multi-shot acquisition methods, such as multiplexed sensitivity encoding (MUSE), can attain high-resolution and high-quality DWI with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance superior to that of the conventional parallel imaging method, the prolonged scan time associated with multi-shot acquisition is impractical for routine IVIM DWI. This study proposes an acquisition and reconstruction framework based on parametric-POCSMUSE to accelerate the four-shot IVIM DWI with 70% reduction of total scan time (13 min 8 s versus 4 min 8 s). First, the four-shot IVIM DWI scan with 17 b values was accelerated by acquiring only one segment per b value except for b values of 0 and 600 s/mm2. Second, an IVIM-estimation scheme was integrated into the parametric-POCSMUSE to enable joint reconstruction of multi-b images from under-sampled four-shot IVIM DWI data. In vivo experiments on both healthy subjects and patients show that the proposed framework successfully produced multi-b DW images with significantly higher SNRs and lower reconstruction errors than did the conventional acceleration method based on parallel imaging. In addition, the IVIM quantitative maps estimated from the data produced by the proposed framework showed quality comparable to that of fully sampled MUSE-reconstructed images, suggesting that the proposed framework can enable highly accelerated multi-shot IVIM DWI without sacrificing data quality. In summary, the proposed framework can make multi-shot IVIM DWI feasible in a routine MRI examination, with reasonable scan time and improved geometric fidelity.
The proposed reconstruction framework based on parametric-POCSMUSE can enable 3.2-fold scan acceleration compared with four-shot IVIM DWI with MUSE. In addition to being able to produce multi-b DW images with less distortion, it can also derive the IVIM quantitative maps with quality comparable to that of fully sampled four-shot IVIM DWI data.image

N2  -  The aim of the study is to assess the possibilities of the combined approach to using multimodal MRI, neuronavigation, and awake craniotomy in resecting tumors of eloquent areas.
Materials and Methods. The results of 30 successive awake surgical interventions performed in 2017-2019 years in patients with tumors of eloquent areas have been analyzed. The main selection criterion for this type of operations was the location of the tumor in the projection or in the immediate proximity to the cortical centers of speech and motion. To minimize the damage, patients underwent functional MRI and DTI tractography at the prehospital stage to identify cortical regions and white matter tracts involved in the motor and language functions; immediately before the operation the acquired data was loaded into the navigation StealthStation S7 (Medtronic, USA) to plan and monitor surgery stages; during the surgery, direct cortical and subcortical stimulation was performed to identify the motor and speech centers (asleep-awake-asleep technique) with neurolinguistic testing. Karnofsky performance status, assessment of the patient's neurological status, frequency of epileptic seizures before and after the operation, the extent of the tumor resection, and the data analysis after the linguistic testing were used to determine the patients' condition and surgery outcomes.; Results. Improvement of the general state after the operation has been noted in 30% of patients compared to the preoperative condition, no neurological deficit dynamics has been observed in 33% of patients. Postoperative multimodal MRI showed that total tumor removal was achieved in 37% of cases, subtotal in 40%, partial removal resection in 23% of cases.; Conclusion. The combined approach to the brain tumor resection using multimodal MRI, neuronavigation, and awake craniotomy with motor and language areas mapping allows neurosurgeons to minimize the risk of persistent neurological deficit occurrence and provides the possibility to perform maximal resection possible preserving the patients' functional status. The presented methodology is reproducible, permitting one to expand the options of surgical treatment when lesions are localized in eloquent areas.

N2  -  Objective: When gliomas grow in an infiltrative form, high-grade malignant glioma tissue extends beyond the contrast-enhancing tumor boundary, and this diffuse non-enhancing tumor infiltration is not visible on conventional MRI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-derived parameters in a group of patients with pre-operative gliomas, evaluating changes in the solid tumor and peritumoral edema area, and investigating their use for evaluating the recurrence and prognosis of gliomas. Methods: In this retrospective study, 51 patients with gliomas who underwent biopsy or surgery underwent DKI scans before surgery. DKI scans were performed to generate DKI parameter maps of the solid tumor and peritumoral edema areas. In the solid tumor area, the kurtosis parameters showed the highest area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for distinguishing high- and low-grade gliomas (all P < 0.01). Results: In the peritumoral edema area, significant differences were found between groups with grade III and IV gliomas (P < 0.05). DKI parameters were found to correlate with clinical Ki-67 scores within the solid tumor area (MK: R2 = 0.288, P < 0.001; Kr: R2 = 0.270, P < 0.001; Ka: R2 = 0.274, P < 0.001; MD: R2 = 0.223, P < 0.001; FA: R2 = 0.098, P < 0.01). No significant correlations were found between Ki-67 and kurtosis parameters of peritumoral edema. Conclusions: In this study, DKI showed potential utility for studying solid tumor and peritumoral edema of high grade gliomas.

N2  -  Purpose: To rapidly obtain high isotropic-resolution T-2 maps with whole-brain coverage and high geometric fidelity.
Methods: A T-2 blip-updown EPI acquisition with generalized slice-dithered enhanced resolution (T-2-BUDA-gSlider) is proposed. A RF-encoded multi-slab spin-echo (SE) EPI acquisition with multiple TEs was developed to obtain high SNR efficiency with reduced TR. This was combined with an interleaved 2-shot EPI acquisition using blip-updown phase encoding. An estimated field map was incorporated into the joint multi-shot EPI reconstruction with a structured low rank constraint to achieve distortion-free and robust reconstruction for each slab without navigation. A Bloch simulated subspace model was integrated into gSlider reconstruction and used for T-2 quantification.; Results: In vivo results demonstrated that the T-2 values estimated by the proposed method were consistent with gold standard spin-echo acquisition. Compared to the reference 3D fast spin echo (FSE) images, distortion caused by off-resonance and eddy current effects were effectively mitigated.; Conclusion: BUDA-gSlider SE-EPI acquisition and gSlider-subspace joint reconstruction enabled distortion-free whole-brain T-2 mapping in 2 min at similar to 1 mm(3) isotropic resolution, which could bring significant benefits to related clinical and neuroscience applications.

N2  -  We tested our hypothesis that fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of diffusion tensor imaging could be used to differentiate between a solitary brain metastasis and a high-grade glioma. In seven patients with a solitary metastasis and seven patients with a high-grade glioma, FA values of enhancing and non-enhancing parts of the tumour were compared. Additionally, we visually assessed FA maps. No significant difference in the FA values of either the enhancing or non-enhancing part was found between the two groups. In the visual assessment, displacement of subcortical white-matter fibres was found in five of the seven metastasis patients, but in only one glioma patient. Additionally, discrimination between tumour and oedema was possible in three of the seven metastasis patients, but not in any glioma patient. Although FA values are not helpful in differentiating between the two groups, visual differences in FA values can allow the differentiation. Displacement of white-matter fibres is another finding suggestive of metastasis.

N2  -  The neural correlates of stuttering are to date incompletely understood. Although the possible involvement of the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and certain parts of the cerebral cortex in this speech disorder has previously been reported, there are still not many studies investigating the role of white matter fibers in stuttering. Axonal stimulation during awake surgery provides a unique opportunity to study the functional role of structural connectivity. Here, our goal was to investigate the white matter tracts implicated in stuttering, by combining direct electrostimulation mapping and postoperative tractography imaging, with a special focus on the left frontal aslant tract. Eight patients with no preoperative stuttering underwent awake surgery for a left frontal low-grade glioma. Intraoperative cortical and axonal electrical mapping was used to interfere in speech processing and subsequently provoke stuttering. We further assessed the relationship between the subcortical sites leading to stuttering and the spatial course of the frontal aslant tract. All patients experienced intraoperative stuttering during axonal electrostimulation. On postsurgical tractographies, the subcortical distribution of stimulated sites matched the topographical position of the left frontal aslant tract. This white matter pathway was preserved during surgery, and no patients had postoperative stuttering. For the first time to our knowledge, by using direct axonal stimulation combined with postoperative tractography, we provide original data supporting a pivotal role of the left frontal aslant tract in stuttering. We propose that this speech disorder could be the result of a disconnection within a large-scale cortico-subcortical circuit subserving speech motor control.

N2  -  Diffusion-tensor MRI (DT-MRI) yields information about the magnitude, anisotropy, and orientation of water diffusion of brain tissues. Although white matter tractography and eigenvector color maps provide visually appealing displays of white matter tract organization, they do not easily lend themselves to quantitative and statistical analysis. In this study, a set of visual and quantitative tools for the investigation of tensor orientations in the human brain was developed. Visual tools included rose diagrams, which are spherical coordinate histograms of the major eigenvector directions, and 3D scatterplots of the major eigenvector angles. A scatter matrix of major eigenvector directions was used to describe the distribution of major eigenvectors in a defined anatomic region. A measure of eigenvector dispersion was developed to describe the degree of eigenvector coherence in the selected region. These tools were used to evaluate directional organization and the interhemispheric symmetry of DT-MRI data in five healthy human brains and two patients with infiltrative diseases of the white matter tracts. In normal anatomical white matter tracts, a high degree of directional coherence and interhemispheric symmetry was observed. The infiltrative diseases appeared to alter the eigenvector properties of affected white matter tracts, showing decreased eigenvector coherence and interhemispheric symmetry. This novel approach distills the rich, 3D information available from the diffusion tensor into a form that lends itself to quantitative analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.

N2  -  Studies have suggested chronic pain syndromes are associated with neural reorganization in specific regions associated with perception, processing, and integration of pain. Urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) represents a collection of pain syndromes characterized by pelvic pain, namely Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) and Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS), that are both poorly understood in their pathophysiology, and treated ineffectively. We hypothesized patients with UCPPS may have microstructural differences in the brain compared with healthy control subjects (HCs), as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common gastrointestinal pain disorder. In the current study we performed population-based voxel-wise DTI and super-resolution track density imaging (TDI) in a large, two-center sample of phenotyped patients from the multicenter cohort with UCPPS (N = 45), IBS (N = 39), and HCs (N = 56) as part of the MAPP Research Network. Compared with HCs, UCPPS patients had lower fractional anisotropy (FA), lower generalized anisotropy (GA), lower track density, and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in brain regions commonly associated with perception and integration of pain information. Results also showed significant differences in specific anatomical regions in UCPPS patients when compared with IBS patients, consistent with microstructural alterations specific to UCPPS. While IBS patients showed clear sex related differences in FA, MD, GA, and track density consistent with previous reports, few such differences were observed in UCPPS patients. Heat maps illustrating the correlation between specific regions of interest and various pain and urinary symptom scores showed clustering of significant associations along the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop associated with pain integration, modulation, and perception. Together, results suggest patients with UCPPS have extensive microstructural differences within the brain, many specific to syndrome UCPPS versus IBS, that appear to be localized to regions associated with perception and integration of sensory information and pain modulation, and seem to be a consequence of longstanding pain.

N2  -  Purpose: Characterization of lacunar infarction (LI) by use of multimodal MRI including diffusion-and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI, PWI) is difficult because of the small lesion size. Only a few studies evaluated PWI in LI and the results are inconsistent.
Methods: In 16 LI patients who underwent initial MRI within 6 hours after symptom onset and follow-up MRI within 1 week demographics, clinical presentation, and MRI findings were analyzed with special emphasis on DWI and PWI findings. Time to peak maps were classified as showing a normal perfusion pattern or areas of hypoperfusion which were further categorized in mismatch (PWI>DWI), inverse mismatch (PWI<DWI), and match (PWI=DWI). Quantitative perfusion maps were generated and analyzed by use of Signal Processing in NMR-Software (SPIN).; Results: Of the 16 patients (mean age 65.5 +- 12.9 years), 14 (87.5%) were male. Clinical symptoms comprised dysarthria (50%), hemiparesis (81.3%), and hemihypaesthesia (18.8%). Intravenous thrombolysis was performed in 7 (43.8%) patients. Clinical improvement was observed in 12 patients (75 %), while 2 (12.5%) patients showed a deterioration and another 2 (12.5%) a stable course. Acute ischemic lesions (mean volume of 0.46 +- 0.29 cm(3)) were located in the thalamus (n=8, 50%), internal capsule (n=4, 25%), corona Radiata (n=3, 18.8%) and the mesencephalon (n=1, 6.3%). Circumscribed hypoperfusion (mean volume 0.61 +- 0.48 cm(3)) was evident in 10 (62.5%) patients. Of these, 3 patients demonstrated a match, 4 an inverse mismatch, and 3 a mismatch between DWI and PWI lesion. Mean CBF and CBV ratios were 0.65 +- 0.28 and 0.84 +- 0.41 respectively. Growth of DWI lesions was observed in 7 (43.8%) and reversal of DWI lesions in 3 (18.8%) patients.; Conclusions: MRI allows identification of different DWI and PWI patterns in LI, including growth and reversal of ischemic lesions. Consequently, it may serve for a better characterization of this stroke subtype and support treatment decisions in daily clinical practice.

N2  -  In the present study, we identified the most probable trajectories of point-to-point segregated connections between functional attentional centers using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and a novel diffusion tensor imaging-based algorithm for pathway extraction. Cortical regions activated by a visuospatial attention task were subsequently used as seeds for probabilistic fiber tracking in 26 healthy subjects. Combining probability maps of frontal and temporoparietal regions yielded a network that consisted of dorsal and ventral connections. The dorsal connections linked temporoparietal cortex with the frontal eye field and area 44 of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Traveling along superior longitudinal and arcuate fascicles, these fibers are well described in relation to spatial attention. However, the ventral connections, which traveled in the white matter between insula (INS) cortex and putamen parallel to the sylvian fissure, were not previously described for visuospatial attention. Linking temporoparietal cortex with anterior INS and area 45 of IFG, these connections may provide an anatomical substrate for crossmodal cortical integration needed for stimulus perception and response in relation to current intention. The newly anatomically described integral network for visuospatial attention might improve the understanding of spatial attention deficits after white matter lesions.

N2  -  Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration with the preferential involvement of those forming the papillomacular bundle. The optic nerve is considered the main pathological target for LHON. Our aim was to investigate the possible involvement of the post-geniculate visual pathway in LHON patients. We used diffusion-weighted imaging for in vivo evaluation. Mean diffusivity maps from 22 LHON visually impaired, 11 unaffected LHON mutation carriers and 22 healthy subjects were generated and compared at level of optic radiation (OR). Prefrontal and cerebellar white matter were also analyzed as internal controls. Furthermore, we studied the optic nerve and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in post-mortem specimens obtained from a severe case of LHON compared to an age-matched control. Mean diffusivity values of affected patients were higher than unaffected mutation carriers (P<0.05) and healthy subjects (P<0.01) in OR and not in the other brain regions. Increased OR diffusivity was associated with both disease duration (B = 0.002; P<0.05) and lack of recovery of visual acuity (B = 0.060; P<0.01). Post-mortem investigation detected atrophy (41.9% decrease of neuron soma size in the magnocellular layers and 44.7% decrease in the parvocellular layers) and, to a lesser extent, degeneration (28.5% decrease of neuron density in the magnocellular layers and 28.7% decrease in the parvocellular layers) in the LHON LGN associated with extremely severe axonal loss (99%) in the optic nerve. The post-geniculate involvement in LHON patients is a downstream post-synaptic secondary phenomenon, reflecting deafferentation rather than a primary neurodegeneration due to mitochondrial dysfunction of LGN neurons.

N2  -  Phased-array imaging at 1.5 and 3 T significantly improves image quality compared with that in routine 1.5-T head coil studies. These improvements significantly increase lesion detection in patients with focal epilepsy. Semiautomated image-analysis techniques have the potential to improve lesion detection, assess lesion burden more accurately, characterize cortical abnormalities, and determine the location and extent of associated cortical and deep gray nuclei involvement. With increasing interest in understanding the role white matter plays in epileptogenesis and seizure propagation, diffusion tensor imaging may yield useful information about changes in white matter organization. Our current multimodality imaging combines these structural imaging advances with coregistered neurophysiological information obtained with magneto-encephalography and with simultaneous EEG recordings. Our initial experience suggests that multimodality imaging will improve our ability to detect and define the extent of epileptogenic lesions.

N2  -  Somatosensory dysfunction is associated with a high incidence of functional impairment and safety in patients with stroke. With developments in brain mapping techniques, many studies have addressed the recovery of various functions in such patients. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of recovery of somatosensory function. Based on the previous human studies, a review of 11 relevant studies on the mechanisms underlying the recovery of somatosensory function in stroke patients was conducted based on the following topics: (1) recovery of an injured somatosensory pathway, (2) peri-lesional reorganization, (3) contribution of the unaffected somatosensory cortex, (4) contribution of the secondary somatosensory cortex, and (5) mechanisms of recovery in patients with thalamic lesions. We believe that further studies in this field using combinations of diffusion tensor imaging, functional neuroimaging, and magnetoencephalography are needed. In addition, the clinical significance, critical period, and facilitatory strategies for each recovery mechanism should be clarified.

N2  -  Background: Arboviruses are RNA viruses and some have the potential to cause neuroinvasive disease and are a growing threat to global health.Objectives: Our objective is to identify and map all aspects of arbovirus neuroinvasive disease, clarify key concepts, and identify gaps within our knowledge with appropriate future directions related to the improvement of global health.Methods: Sources of Evidence: A scoping review of the literature was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Hinari. Eligibility Criteria: Original data including epidemiology, risk factors, neurological manifestations, neuro-diagnostics, management, and preventive measures related to neuroinvasive arbovirus infections was obtained. Sources of evidence not reporting on original data, non-English, and not in peer-reviewed journals were removed. Charting Methods: An initial pilot sample of 30 abstracts were reviewed by all authors and a Cohen's kappa of kappa = 0.81 (near-perfect agreement) was obtained. Records were manually reviewed by two authors using the Rayyan QCRI software.Results: A total of 171 records were included. A wide array of neurological manifestations can occur most frequently, including parkinsonism, encephalitis/encephalopathy, meningitis, flaccid myelitis, and Guillain-Barr & eacute; syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain often reveals subcortical lesions, sometimes with diffusion restriction consistent with acute ischemia. Vertical transmission of arbovirus is most often secondary to the Zika virus. Neurological manifestations of congenital Zika syndrome, include microcephaly, failure to thrive, intellectual disability, and seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis often shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated albumin, and protein consistent with blood-brain barrier dysfunction.Conclusions: Arbovirus infection with neurological manifestations leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for disease include living and traveling in an arbovirus endemic zone, age, pregnancy, and immunosuppressed status. The management of neuroinvasive arbovirus disease is largely supportive and focuses on specific neurological complications. There is a need for therapeutics and currently, management is based on disease prevention and limiting zoonosis.

N2  -  We investigated immunohistochemically the cellular localization of multifunctional type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the rat basal ganglia and intrastriatal grafts derived from fetal striatal primordia, in comparison with that of calcineurin, a reliable marker for striatal medium-sized spinous neurons. The type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive neurons were of medium size, with a mean diameter of 16.1 +/- 1.8 mu m (average +/- S.D., n = 72, range 13.6-18.3 mu m) and comprised approximately 70% of the total neuronal population in the striatum. Light microscopy showed that the type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive cells had round, triangular or polygonal cell bodies with relatively little cytoplasm. Analysis of serial sections showed that type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin immunoreactivities were co-localized in the striatal neurons examined with a similar distribution pattern. Type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive cells were always immunoreactive for calcineurin and cells negative for type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase showed no apparent calcineurin immunoreactivity. Type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive nerve fibers in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra almost disappeared following striatal ischemic injury produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and cerebral hemitransection, respectively, suggesting that these immunopositive fibers were striatal projections. Thus, most type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-positive neurons in the rat striatum are considered to be of the medium-sized spinous type. Type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or calcineurin immunoreactivity was also observed in a large number of neurons in transplants derived from fetal striatal primordia grafted into striatal ischemic lesions. In addition, type II Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase- or calcineurin-immunoreactive nerve fibers appeared in the deafferented globus pallidus of the host rats, suggesting that the striatopallidal pathway was reformed by striatal projection neurons of the transplants. This finding may also indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated enzymes are useful for tracing striatal projection fibers as endogenous marker proteins.

N2  -  Mapping with local lesions, electrical or chemical stimulation, or recording evoked field potentials or unit spikes revealed localized representations of cardiovascular functions in the cerebellum. In this review, which is based on literatures in the field (including our own publications), I propose that the cerebellum contains five distinct modules (cerebellar corticonuclear microcomplexes) dedicated to cardiovascular control. First, a discrete rostral portion of the fastigial nucleus and the overlying medial portion of the anterior vermis (lobules 1, 11 and 111) conjointly form a module that controls the baroreflex. Second, anterior vermis also forms a micro-complex with the parabrachial nucleus. Third, a discrete caudal portion of the fastigial nucleus and the overlying medial portion of the posterior vermis (lobules VII and VIII) form another module controlling the vestibulosympathetic reflex. Fourth, the medial portion of the uvula may form a module with the nucleus tractus solitarius and parabrachial nucleus. Fifth, the lateral edge of the nodulus and the uvula.. together with the parabrachial nucleus and vestibular nuclei, forms a cardiovascular microcomplex that controls the magnitude and/or timing of sympathetic nerve responses and stability of the mean arterial blood pressure during changes of head position and body posture. The lateral nodulusuvula appears to be an integrative cardiovascular control center involving both the baroreflex and the vestibulosympathetic reflex.

N2  -  Purpose: To demonstrate that diffusion-weighted images should be acquired at the instant of maximum blood velocity in kidneys to extract the perfusion fraction (PF) by the bi-exponential intravoxel incoherent motion model.
Methods: The PF values were measured in Monte-Carlo simulations corresponding to different blood velocities with a constant known PF. The distribution of the measured PF values (PF-distribution) was characterized quantitatively by 3 markers highlighting the deviation of the measurement from the true PF. Diffusion-weighted images of kidneys were acquired in 10 healthy volunteers at the instant of maximal respectively minimal blood velocity in the renal artery (V-max versus V-min acquisition). The PF-distributions measured from the V-max and V-min acquisitions were compared mutually and with simulated PF-distributions using the 3 markers. A radiologist evaluated the quality of the PF maps.; Results: The PF-distributions measured in the simulations were spread around the true PF value, and spreading was reduced as blood velocity increased. A comparison between simulated and in vivo PF-distributions suggests that a similar phenomenon is plausible in vivo. The quality of the PF maps of the V-max-acquisition was scored higher by the radiologist than those of the V-min-acquisition in 95% of cases (19 of 20).; Conclusions: The PF maps are of better quality when the V-max-acquisition is used. We show evidence supporting the hypothesis that the variation of PF along the cardiac cycle is due to oscillations between a poor estimation when the blood velocity is low, and a better estimation when blood velocity is higher.

N2  -  BACKGROUND Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) may cause cavernoma-related epilepsy (CRE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Functional mapping has shown its usefulness during the resection of eloquent lesions including the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of noninvasive functional mapping on decision-making and resection of eloquently located CCM.; METHODS Of 126 patients with intracranial cavernomas, we prospectively included 40 consecutive patients (31.7%) with highly eloquent CCM between 2012 and 2020. We performed functional mapping via navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) motor mapping in 30 cases and nTMS language mapping in 20 cases. Twenty patients suffered from CRE. CCM caused ICH in 18 cases.; RESULTS We used functional mapping data including function-based tractography in all cases. Indication toward (31 cases) or against (9 cases) CCM resection was influenced by noninvasive functional mapping in 36 cases (90%). We resected CCMs in 24 cases, and 7 patients refused the recommendation for surgery. In 19 and 4 cases, we used additional intraoperative neuromonitoring and awake craniotomy, respectively. Patients suffered from transient postoperative motor or language deficits in 2 and 2 cases, respectively. No patient suffered from permanent deficits. After 1 yr of follow-up, anti-epileptic drugs could be discontinued in all patients who underwent surgery but 1 patient.; CONCLUSION Surgery-related deficit rates are low even for highly eloquent CCM and seizure outcome is excellent. The present results show that noninvasive functional mapping and function-based tractography is a useful tool for the decision-making process and during microsurgical resection of eloquently located CCM.

N2  -  Purpose Assess factors in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) related to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay (LoS). Methods Retrospectively, we collected clinical, biochemical, and imaging data of PRES patients. MRI studies were assessed for imaging severity, and complications, including restricted diffusion and hemorrhage. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed for factors associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and LoS. We assessed for association between clinical and biochemical factors and imaging severity grading systems and complications. Results We had 57 subjects with mean +/- SD age of 56.3 +/- 14.5 years and 68.3% were females. In 60 cases, 36.7% had hypertension, 23.3% had chronic renal disease, 18.3% had sepsis, 16.7% were on active chemotherapy, 10% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 10% with active cancer, 6.7% were eclampsia/preeclampsia, and 1.7% had radiotherapy. We had 17 (26.6%) grade 1, 26 (46.8%) grade 2, 17 (26.6%) grade 3 PRES based on vasogenic edema extent, and 28 (46.7%) severe PRES (>= 5 areas) cases. 19 (31.7%) had restricted diffusion with hemorrhage in 19 (31.7%) cases. On multivariate analysis, ICU admissions showed significant association with hypertension (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 0.96-32.23; p = 0.05), and raised INR (OR = 119, 95% CI: 1.1-1244.3; p = 0.04); LoS with HSCT, mean arterial pressure (MAP), intraparenchymal hematoma, and sepsis; and extent of vasogenic edema with restricted diffusion (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 1.5-12.33; p < 0.01). Conclusion In summary, PRES with hypertension and elevated INR are associated with ICU admissions. HSCT, MAP, intraparenchymal hematoma, and sepsis correlated with LoS. Imaging severity grading based on vasogenic edema extent may be better due to association with restricted diffusion.

N2  -  Introduction: During the last decade, a multitude of novel quantitative and semiquantitative MRI techniques have provided new information about the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. Yet, selection of the most relevant contrasts for a given pathology remains challenging. In this work, we developed and validated a method, Gated-Attention MEchanism Ranking of multi-contrast MRI in brain pathology (GAMER MRI), to rank the relative importance of MR measures in the classification of well understood ischemic stroke lesions. Subsequently, we applied this method to the classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, where the relative importance of MR measures is less understood.
Methods: GAMER MRI was developed based on the gated attention mechanism, which computes attention weights (AWs) as proxies of importance of hidden features in the classification. In the first two experiments, we used Trace-weighted (Trace), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted (T1w) images acquired in 904 acutesubacute ischemic stroke patients and in 6,230 healthy controls and patients with other brain pathologies to assess if GAMER MRI could produce clinically meaningful importance orders in two different classification scenarios. In the first experiment, GAMER MRI with a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) was used in conjunction with Trace, ADC, and FLAIR to distinguish patients with ischemic stroke from those with other pathologies and healthy controls. In the second experiment, GAMER MRI with a patch-based CNN used Trace, ADC and T1w to differentiate acute ischemic stroke lesions from healthy tissue. The last experiment explored the performance of patch-based CNN with GAMER MRI in ranking the importance of quantitative MRI measures to distinguish two groups of lesions with different pathological characteristics and unknown quantitative MR features. Specifically, GAMER MRI was applied to assess the relative importance of the myelin water fraction (MWF), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), T1 relaxometry map (qT1), and neurite density index (NDI) in distinguishing 750 juxtacortical lesions from 242 periventricular lesions in 47 MS patients. Pair-wise permutation t-tests were used to evaluate the differences between the AWs obtained for each quantitative measure.; Results: In the first experiment, we achieved a mean test AUC of 0.881 and the obtained AWs of FLAIR and the sum of AWs of Trace and ADC were 0.11 and 0.89, respectively, as expected based on previous knowledge. In the second experiment, we achieved a mean test F1 score of 0.895 and a mean AW of Trace = 0.49, of ADC = 0.28, and of T1w = 0.23, thereby confirming the findings of the first experiment. In the third experiment, MS lesion classification achieved test balanced accuracy = 0.777, sensitivity = 0.739, and specificity = 0.814. The mean AWs of T1map, MWF, NDI, and QSM were 0.29, 0.26, 0.24, and 0.22 (p < 0.001), respectively.; Conclusions: This work demonstrates that the proposed GAMER MRI might be a useful method to assess the relative importance of MRI measures in neurological diseases with focal pathology. Moreover, the obtained AWs may in fact help to choose the best combination of MR contrasts for a specific classification problem.

N2  -  We used indirect brain mapping with virtual lesion tractography to test the hypothesis that the extent of white matter tract disconnection due to white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is associated with corresponding tractspecific cognitive performance decrements. To estimate tract disconnection, WMH masks were extracted from FLAIR MRI data of 481 cognitively intact participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and used as regions of avoidance for fiber tracking in diffusion MRI data from 50 healthy young participants from the Human Connectome Project. Estimated tract disconnection in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, right frontal aslant tract, and right superior longitudinal fasciculus mediated the effects of WMH volume on executive function. Estimated tract disconnection in the left uncinate fasciculus mediated the effects of WMH volume on memory and in the right frontal aslant tract on language. In a subset of ADNI control participants with amyloid data, positive status increased the probability of periventricular WMH and moderated the relationship between WMH burden and tract disconnection in executive function performance.

T2  -  BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR

N2  -  Subcaudate tractotomy (SCT) is a neurosurgical lesioning procedure that can reduce symptoms in medically intractable obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the putative importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in symptomatology, fibers that connect the OFC, SCT lesion, and either the thalamus or brainstem were investigated with two-tensor tractography using an unscented Kalman filter approach. From this dataset, fibers were warped to Montreal Neurological Institute space, and probability maps with center-of-mass analysis were subsequently generated. In comparing fibers from the same OFC region, including medial OFC (mOFC), central OFC (cOFC), and lateral OFC (lOFC), the area of divergence for fibers connected with the thalamus versus the brainstem is posterior to the anterior commissure. At the anterior commissure, fibers connected with the thalamus run dorsal to those connected with the brainstem. As OFC fibers travel through the ventral aspect of the internal capsule, lOFC fibers are dorsal to cOFC and mOFC fibers. Using neuroanatomical comparison, tracts coursing between the OFC and thalamus are likely part of the anterior thalamic radiations, while those between the OFC and brainstem likely belong to the medial forebrain bundle. These data support the involvement of the OFC in OCD and may be relevant to creating differential lesional procedures of specific tracts or to developing deep brain stimulation programming paradigms.

N2  -  Background and ObjectivesFemale patients tend to have greater disability and worse long-term outcomes after stroke than male patients. To date, the biological basis of sex difference in ischemic stroke remains unclear. We aimed to (1) assess sex differences in clinical manifestation and outcomes of acute ischemic stroke and (2) investigate whether the sex disparity is due to different infarct locations or different impacts of infarct in the same location.MethodsThis MRI-based multicenter study included 6,464 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke (< 7 days) from 11 centers in South Korea (May 2011-January 2013). Multivariable statistical and brain mapping methods were used to analyze clinical and imaging data collected prospectively: admission NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, early neurologic deterioration (END) within 3 weeks, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months, and culprit cerebrovascular lesion (symptomatic large artery steno-occlusion and cerebral infarction) locations.ResultsThe mean (SD) age was 67.5 (12.6) years, and 2,641 (40.9%) were female patients. Percentage infarct volumes on diffusion-weighted MRI did not differ between female patients and male patients (median 0.14% vs 0.14%, p = 0.35). However, female patients showed higher stroke severity (NIHSS score, median 4 vs 3, p < 0.001) and had more frequent END (adjusted difference 3.5%; p = 0.002) than male patients. Female patients had more frequent striatocapsular lesions (43.6% vs 39.8%, p = 0.001) and less frequent cerebrocortical (48.2% vs. 50.7% in patients older than 52 years, p = 0.06) and cerebellar (9.1% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.009) lesions than male patients, which aligned with angiographic findings: female patients had more prevalent symptomatic steno-occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (31.1% vs 25.3%; p < 0.001) compared with male patients, who had more frequent symptomatic steno-occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (14.2% vs 9.3%; p < 0.001) and vertebral artery (6.5% vs 4.7%; p = 0.001). Cortical infarcts in female patients, specifically left-sided parieto-occipital regions, were associated with higher NIHSS scores than expected for similar infarct volumes in male patients. Consequently, female patients had a higher likelihood of unfavorable functional outcome (mRS score > 2) than male patients (adjusted absolute difference 4.5%; 95% CI 2.0-7.0; p < 0.001).DiscussionFemale patients have more frequent MCA disease and striatocapsular motor pathway involvement with acute ischemic stroke, along with left parieto-occipital cortical infarcts showing greater severity for equivalent infarct volumes than in male patients. This leads to more severe initial neurologic symptoms, higher susceptibility to neurologic worsening, and less 3-month functional independence, when compared with male patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantifying changes in the human brain that occur as part of normal aging may help in the diagnosis of diseases that affect the elderly and that cause structural changes in the brain. We sought to assess diffusion changes that are inherently related to brain structure during aging.
METHODS: MR scans were obtained from 11 healthy volunteers and 27 patients (ages 26 to 86 years 53.4 +- 17.0 years). Images acquired from the patients either showed no abnormalities, contained minimal periventricular white matter changes, or revealed focal lesions, Maps of the average diffusion constant (D-av) were calculated for each subject. Changes in D-av were determined with distribution analysis (histogram) for the entire brain and compared with region-of-interest measurements from the periventricular white matter and thalamus,; RESULTS: Mean D-av of the entire brain (0.74 +- 0.02 x 10(-5) cm(2)s) showed weaker age dependency compared with the periventricular white matter D-av(0.76 +- 0.04 x 10(-5) cm(2)s), The D-av of the thalamus D-av (0.75 +- 0.03 x 10(-5) cm(2)s) had no age dependency. The age-dependent changes of entire brain D-av may be significant for subjects older than 60 years compared with younger subjects.; CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed minimal changes in the D-av of the entire brain with aging. The mean D-av of the human brain is nearly constant throughout most of adulthood.

N2  -  Several diffusion tensor imaging studies reveal that white matter (WM) lesions are common in children suffering from benign cerebellar tumours who are treated with surgery only. The clinical implications of WM alterations that occur as a direct consequence of cerebellar disease have not been thoroughly studied. Here, we analysed structural and diffusion imaging data from cerebellar patients with chronic surgical lesions after resection for benign cerebellar tumours. We aimed to elucidate the impact of focal lesions of the cerebellum on WM integrity across the entire brain, and to investigate whether WM deficits were associated with behavioural impairment in three different motor tasks. Lesion symptom mapping analysis suggested that lesions in critical cerebellar regions were related to deficits in savings during an eyeblink conditioning task, as well as to deficits in motor action timing. Diffusion imaging analysis of cerebellar WM indicated that better behavioural performance was associated with higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the superior cerebellar peduncle, cerebellum's main outflow path. Moreover, voxel-wise analysis revealed a global pattern of WM deficits in patients within many cerebral WM tracts critical for motor and non-motor function. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between FA and savings within cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways in patients but not in controls, showing that saving effects partly depend on extracerebellar areas, and may be recruited for compensation. These results confirm that the cerebellum has extended connections with many cerebral areas involved in motor/cognitive functions, and the observed WM changes likely contribute to long-term clinical deficits of posterior fossa tumour survivors.

N2  -  Background: Heterogeneity of arterial transit time due to cerebral artery steno-occlusive lesions hampers accurate regional cerebral blood flow measurement by arterial spin labeling (ASL).
Purpose: To assess the feasibility of regional cerebral blood flow measurement by ASL with multiple-delay time sampling in patients with steno-occlusive diseases by comparing with positron emission tomography (PET), and to determine whether regional arterial transit time measured by this ASL technique is correlated with regional mean transit time, a PET index of perfusion pressure.; Material and Methods: Sixteen patients with steno-occlusive diseases received both ASL and O-15-PET. The mean regional cerebral blood flow measured by ASL and PET, regional arterial transit time by ASL, and regional mean transit time by PET were obtained by a region-of-interest analysis. Correlation between regional cerebral blood flow by ASL and that by PET, and correlation between regional arterial transit time by ASL and regional mean transit time by PET were tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient for both absolute and relative values. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to test whether regional arterial transit time by ASL was a significant contributor in modeling regional mean transit time by PET after controlling the effect of regional cerebral blood flow by ASL.; Results: A significant positive correlation was found between regional cerebral blood flow by ASL and that by PET for both absolute (r = 0.520, P < 0.0001) and relative (r = 0.691, P < 0.0001) values. A significant positive correlation was found between regional arterial transit time by ASL and regional mean transit time by PET both for absolute (r = 0.369, P = 0.0002) and relative (r = 0.443, P < 0.0001) values. The regression analysis revealed that regional arterial transit time by ASL was a significant contributor in modeling regional mean transit time by PET after controlling regional cerebral blood flow by ASL (P = 0.0011).; Conclusion: The feasibility of regional cerebral blood flow measurement using ASL with multiple-delay time sampling was confirmed in patients with cerebral artery steno-occlusive diseases. Moreover, it was suggested that mapping of regional arterial transit time has the potential to detect hemodynamic impairment.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To evaluate the performance of multiparametric MR images in differentiation of different regions of the gross tumor area and for assessment of glioma grade.
METHODS Forty-six glioma subjects (18 grade II, 11 grade III, and 17 grade IV) underwent a comprehensive MR and spectroscopic imaging procedure. Maps were generated by subtraction of T1-weighted images from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (Delta T1 map) and T1-weighted images from T2-weighted images (Delta T2 map). Regions of interest (ROIs) were positioned in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), enhancing tumor, hyperintense T2, necrotic region, and immediate and distal peritumoral regions (IPR and DPR). Relative signal contrast was estimated as difference between mean intensities in ROIs and NAWM. Classification using support vector machines was applied to all image series to determine the efficacy of regional contrast measures for differentiation of low- and high-grade lesions and grade III and IV lesions.; RESULTS Delta T1 and Delta T2 maps offered higher contrast as compared to other parametric maps in differentiating enhancing tumor and edematous regions, respectively, and provided the highest classification accuracy for differentiating low- and high-grade tumors, of 91% and 90.4%. CholineN-acetylaspartate maps provided significant contrast for delineating IPR and DPR. For differentiating high-grade gliomas, Delta T2 and Delta T1 maps provided a mean accuracy of 90.9% and 88.2%, which was lower than that obtained using cerebral blood volume (93.7%) and cholinecreatine (93.3%) maps.; CONCLUSION This study showed that subtraction maps provided significant contrast in differentiating several regions of the gross tumor area and are of benefit for accurate tumor grading.

N2  -  This study investigated the role of spontaneous and induced spreading depression (SD) on the evolution of focal ischemia in vivo. We induced focal ischemia in 12 rats using the middle cerebral artery suture occlusion (MCAO) method. Chemical stimulation of nonischemic ipsilateral cortex by potassium chloride application (KCI group; n = 7) and saline (NaCl group; n = 5) was performed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following MCAO, and SD was detected electrophysiologically. Ischemic lesion volumes assessed over 15-minute intervals, evaluated by continuous apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water mapping, demonstrated that the ischemic region increased significantly during 15-minute time epochs with a single SD episode (36.5 +/- 12.9 mm(3), mean +/- SD) or multiple SD episodes (39.8 +/- 22.3) compared with those without SD (13.9 +/- 11.5) (p = 0.0009). Infarct volume at postmortem 24 hours after MCAO was significantly larger in the KCI group, with more total SDs (237.8 +/- 13.8) than the NaCl group (190.5 +/- 12.6) (p = 0.0001). This study demonstrates that ischemia-related and induced SDs increase significantly ischemic lesion volume in vivo, supporting the hypothesis for a causative role of SD in extending focal ischemic injury.

N2  -  Purpose Posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) is a serious complication faced by neurosurgeons and their patients, especially in paediatric medulloblastoma patients. The uncertain aetiology of PFS, myriad of cited risk factors and therapeutic challenges make this phenomenon an elusive entity. The primary objective of this study was to identify associative factors related to the development of PFS in medulloblastoma patient posttumour resection.
Methods This is a retrospective study based at a single institution. Patient data and all related information were collected from the hospital records, in accordance to a list of possible risk factors associated with PFS. These included pre-operative tumour volume, hydrocephalus, age, gender, extent of resection, metastasis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, postoperative meningitis and radiological changes in MRI. Additional variables included molecular and histological subtypes of each patient's medulloblastoma tumour. Statistical analysis was employed to determine evidence of each variable's significance in PFS permanence.; Results A total of 19 patients with appropriately complete data was identified. Initial univariate analysis did not show any statistical significance. However, multivariate analysis for MRI-specific changes reported bilateral DWI restricted diffusion changes involving both right and left sides of the surgical cavity was of statistical significance for PFS permanence.; Conclusion The authors performed a clinical study that evaluated possible risk factors for permanent PFS in paediatric medulloblastoma patients. Analysis of collated results found that post-operative DWI restriction in bilateral regions within the surgical cavity demonstrated statistical significance as a predictor of PFS permanence-a novel finding in the current literature.

N2  -  Recent advancements in radiological techniques have enabled the observation of the topographic distribution of the human corpus callosum. However, its functional connectivity remains to be elucidated. The symptoms of callosal disconnection syndrome (CDS) can potentially reveal the functional connections between the cerebral hemispheres. Herein, we report a patient with CDS, whose callosal lesion was restricted to the posterior midbody, isthmus, and an anterior part of the dorsal splenium. A 53-year-old right-handed woman demonstrated CDS following cerebral infarction associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. She exhibited CDS including ideomotor apraxia, and tactile anomia with the left hand, cross-replication of hand postures, cross-localization of the fingers, and constructional impairment with the right hand. Six months after onset, the left-handed ideomotor apraxia on imitation improved, but that to command did not, which indicated the difference in the nature of the transcallosal connections between ideomotor apraxia on imitation and ideomotor apraxia to command. Longitudinal CDS observation and corpus callosum tractography will prove useful in expanding our understanding of the nature of the organization of interhemispheric information transference.

N2  -  Background: The outcome for patients with hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) is often poor. It is important to establish an accurate prognosis as soon as possible after the insult to guide management. Clinical assessment is not reliable and ancillary investigations, particularly imaging and EEG, are needed to understand the severity of brain injury and the likely outcome.
Methods: We undertook a retrospective study of 39 patients on an intensive therapy unit (ITU) with HIBI who were referred for MRI. The patients were seen consecutively > 57 months. HIBI was due to a variety of insults causing cardiac arrest, hypoperfusion or isolated hypoxia.; Results: The outcome was poor, 29 patients died, 7 were left severely disabled and only 3 made a good recovery. Characteristic imaging changes were seen on MRI. These included extensive changes in the cortex and the deep grey matter present on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging within 6 days of the insult. In other patients, different patterns of involvement of the cortex and basal ganglia occurred. There was no significant difference in the outcome or imaging appearances according to aetiology. A poor prognosis was consistently associated with a non- or poorly responsive EEG rhythm and the presence of periodic generalized phenomena with a very low-voltage background activity.; Conclusion: In this retrospective study of patients with HIBI, MRI and EEG provided valuable information concerning prognosis.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Diffusion MRI is attracting increasing interest for tissue characterization of gliomas, especially after the introduction of antiangiogenic therapy to treat malignant gliomas. The goal of the current study is to elucidate the actual magnitude of the correlation between diffusion MRI and cell density within the tissue. The obtained results were further extended and compared with metabolic imaging with C-11-methionine (MET) PET.
METHODS Ninety-eight tissue samples from 37 patients were stereotactically obtained via an intraoperative neuronavigation system. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and MET PET were performed as routine presurgical imaging studies for these patients. DTI was converted into fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and MET PET images were registered to Gd-administered T1-weighted images that were used for navigation. Metrics of FA, ADC, and tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of MET PET along with relative values of FA (rFA) and ADC (rADC) compared with normal-appearing white matter were correlated with cell density of the stereotactically obtained tissues.; RESULTS rADC was significantly lower in lesions obtained from Gd-enhancing lesions than from nonenhancing lesions. Although rADC showed a moderate but statistically significant negative correlation with cell density (p = 0.010), MET PET showed a superb positive correlation with cell density (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, rFA showed little correlation with cell density.; CONCLUSIONS The presented data validated the use of rADC for estimating the treatment response of gliomas but also caution against overestimating its limited accuracy compared with MET PET.

N2  -  Objective: Image quality in high-field intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is often influenced negatively by susceptibility artifacts. While routine sequences are rather robust, advanced imaging such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is very sensitive to susceptibility resulting in insufficient imaging data. This study aims to analyze intraoperatively acquired DWI to identify the main factors for susceptibility, to compare results with postoperative images and to identify technical aspects for improvement of intraoperative DWI. Methods: 100 patients with intraaxial lesions operated in a high-field iMRI were analyzed retrospectively for the quality of intraoperative DWI in comparison to the postoperative scan. General quality of the MR scan, individual diffusion restrictions, artifacts, and their causes were analyzed. Results: Inclusion criteria were met in 78 patients, 124 diffusion restrictions were included in the comparative analysis. PPV and NPV for the detection of DWI changes intraoperatively were 0.94 and 0.56, respectively (SEN 0.94; SPE 0.56). Image quality was rated significantly (p< 0.0001) worse intraoperatively compared to the postoperative MRI. The main reasons for reduced image quality intraoperatively were air (64%) and artificial material (e.g., compress) (38%) in the resection cavity, as well as positioning of patient's head outside the MR's isocenter 37%. Analysis of surgical approaches showed that frontal craniotomies have the highest risk of limited image quality (40%), whereat better results (15% limited image quality) were seen for all other approaches (p= 0.059). Conclusion: Intraoperative DWI showed reliable results in this analysis. However, image-quality was limited severely in many cases leading to uncertainty in the interpretation. Susceptibility-causing factors might be prevented in many cases, if the surgical team is aware of them. The most important factors are good filling of the resection cavity with irrigation fluid, not placing artificial materials in the resection cavity and adequate positioning of patient's head according to the MR isocenter.

N2  -  Headache is a common symptom in acute ischaemic stroke, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. The aim of this lesion mapping study was to identify brain regions, which are related to the development of headache in acute ischaemic stroke. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke (n = 100) were assessed by brain MRI at 3 T including diffusion weighted imaging. We included 50 patients with stroke and headache as well as 50 patients with stroke but no headache symptoms. Infarcts were manually outlined and images were transformed into standard stereotaxic space using non-linear warping. Voxel-wise overlap and subtraction analyses of lesions as well as non-parametric statistics were conducted. The same analyses were carried out by flipping of left-sided lesions, so that all strokes were transformed to the same hemisphere. Between the headache group as well as the non-headache there was no difference in infarct volumes, in the distribution of affected vascular beds or in the clinical severity of strokes. The headache phenotype was tension-type like in most cases. Subtraction analysis revealed that in headache sufferers infarctions were more often distributed in two well-known areas of the central pain matrix: the insula and the somatosensory cortex. This result was confirmed in the flipped analysis and by non-parametric statistical testing (whole brain corrected P-value < 0.01). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lesion mapping study investigating potential lesional patterns associated with headache in acute ischaemic stroke. Insular strokes turned out to be strongly associated with headache. As the insular cortex is a well-established region in pain processing, our results suggest that, at least in a subgroup of patients, acute stroke-related headache might be centrally driven.

N2  -  Facial self-awareness is a basic human ability dependent on a distributed bilateral neural network and revealed through prioritized processing of our own over other faces. Using non-prosopagnosic patients we show, for the first time, that facial self-awareness can be fractionated into different component processes. Patients performed two face perception tasks. In a face orientation task, they judged whether their own or others' faces were oriented to the left or right. In the 'cross' experiment, they judged which horizontal or vertical element in a cross was relatively longer while ignoring a task-irrelevant face presented as background. The data indicate that impairments to a distinct task-based prioritization process (when faces had to be attended) were present after brain damage to right superior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and left middle temporal gyrus. In contrast, impairments to automatic prioritization processes (when faces had to be ignored) were associated only with left hemisphere damage (the cingulate gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and superior temporal gyrus). In addition, both automatic and task-based self-prioritizations were affected by damage to left supramarginal and angular gyrus. The results for the gray matter analyses also extended to the adjacent white matter fiber tracts including the inferior occipital-frontal fasciculus, cingulum, and optic radiation. The data provide the first empirical evidence for separate functional roles of the left and right hemispheres in different aspects of self-face perception and suggest distinct functional processes respectively for paying attention to and for ignoring self-related information.

N2  -  Our knowledge on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis has evolved towards the view that this syndrome affects widespread brain networks. Diffusion weighted imaging studies have shown alterations of large white matter tracts, most notably in left temporal lobe epilepsy, but the degree of altered connections between cortical and subcortical structures remains to be clarified. We performed a whole brain connectome analysis in 39 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (20 right and 19 left) and 28 healthy subjects. We performed whole-brain probabilistic fiber tracking using MRtrix and segmented 164 cortical and subcortical structures with Freesurfer. Individual structural connectivity graphs based on these 164 nodes were computed by mapping the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) onto each tract. Connectomes were then compared using two complementary methods: permutation tests for pair-wise connections and Network Based Statistics to probe for differences in large network components. Comparison of pair-wise connections revealed a marked reduction of connectivity between left TLE patients and controls, which was strongly lateralized to the ipsilateral temporal lobe. Specifically, infero-lateral cortex and temporal pole were strongly affected, and so was the perisylvian cortex. In contrast, for right TLE, focal connectivity loss was much less pronounced and restricted to bilateral limbic structures and right temporal cortex. Analysis of large network components revealed furthermore that both left and right hippocampal sclerosis affected diffuse global and interhemispheric connectivity. Thus, left temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with a much more pronounced pattern of reduced FA, that included major landmarks of perisylvian language circuitry. These distinct patterns of connectivity associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis show how a focal pathology influences global network architecture, and how left or right-sided lesions may have differential and specific impacts on cerebral connectivity.

N2  -  Background: Preoperative radiological assessment of meningioma characteristics is of value for pre- and post-operative patient management, counselling, and surgical approach.
Purpose: To investigate whether tensor-valued diffusion MRI can add to the preoperative prediction of meningioma consistency, grade and type.; Materials and methods: 30 patients with intracranial meningiomas (22 WHO grade I, 8 WHO grade II) underwent MRI prior to surgery. Diffusion MRI was performed with linear and spherical b-tensors with b-values up to 2000 smm(2). The data were used to estimate mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK) and its components-the anisotropic and isotropic kurtoses (MKA and MKI). Meningioma consistency was estimated for 16 patients during resection based on ultrasonic aspiration intensity, ease of resection with instrumentation or suction. Grade and type were determined by histopathological analysis. The relation between consistency, grade and type and dMRI parameters was analyzed inside the tumor ("whole-tumor") and within brain tissue in the immediate periphery outside the tumor ("rim") by histogram analysis.; Results: Lower 10th percentiles of MK and MKA in the whole-tumor were associated with firm consistency compared with pooled soft and variable consistency (n = 7 vs 9; U test, p = 0.02 for MKA 10 and p = 0.04 for MK10) and lower 10th percentile of MD with variable against soft and firm (n = 5 vs 11; U test, p = 0.02). Higher standard deviation of MKI in the rim was associated with lower grade (n = 22 vs 8; U test, p = 0.04) and in the MKI maps we observed elevated rim-like structure that could be associated with grade. Higher median MKA and lower median MKI distinguished psammomatous type from other pooled meningioma types (n = 5 vs 25; U test; p = 0.03 for MKA 50 and p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for MKI 50).; Conclusion: Parameters from tensor-valued dMRI can facilitate prediction of consistency, grade and type.

N2  -  Adult Long Evans rats received a photothrombotic stroke that destroyed >90% of the sensorimotor cortex unilaterally; they were subsequently treated intrathecally for 2 weeks with a function blocking antibody against the neurite growth inhibitory central nervous system protein Nogo-A. Fine motor control of skilled forelimb grasping improved to 65% of intact baseline performance in the anti-Nogo-A treated rats, whereas control antibody treated animals recovered to only 20% of baseline scores. Bilateral retrograde tract tracing with two different tracers from the intact and the denervated side of the cervical spinal cord, at different time points post-lesion, indicated that the intact corticospinal tract had extensively sprouted across the midline into the denervated spinal hemicord. The original axonal arbours of corticospinal tract fibres that had recrossed the midline were subsequently withdrawn, leading to a complete side-switch in the projection of a subpopulation of contralesional corticospinal tract axons. Anterograde tracing from the contralesional cortex showed a 2-3-fold increase of midline crossing fibres and additionally a massive sprouting of the pre-existing ipsilateral ventral corticospinal tract fibres throughout the entire cervical enlargement of the anti-Nogo-A antibody-treated rats compared to the control group. The laminar distribution pattern of the ipsilaterally projecting corticospinal tract fibres was similar to that in the intact spinal cord. These plastic changes were paralleled by a somatotopic reorganization of the contralesional motor cortex where the formation of an ipsilaterally projecting forelimb area was observed. Intracortical microstimulation of the contralesional motor cortex revealed that low threshold currents evoked ipsilateral movements and electromyography responses at frequent cortical sites in the anti-Nogo-A, but not in the control antibody-treated animals. Subsequent transection of the spared corticospinal tract in chronically recovered animals, treated with anti-Nogo-A, led to a reappearance of the initial lesion deficit observed after the stroke lesion. These results demonstrate a somatotopic side switch anatomically and functionally in the projection of adult corticospinal neurons, induced by the destruction of one sensorimotor cortex and the neutralization of the CNS growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A.

N2  -  Background. - Pyogenic brain abscesses are rare and their diagnosis may be difficult because of the absence of specific clinical or biological signs. Moreover, microbiological diagnosis often tacks, making antibiotic choices hazardous and partly explaining the stilt high mortality and morbidity rates.
Additionally, because immunosuppressed patients are more often involved today, and because ear, nose and throat or dental infections are less frequently the responsible mechanisms, recent epidemiological changes have been noticed in the bacterial. species involved in brain abscesses, making it all the more necessary to obtain a microbiological diagnosis.; Imaging and surgery. - Recent progresses have been made in diagnostic strategies. Indeed, diffusion-weighted MRI sequences are sensitive and specific to differentiate pyogenic brain abscesses from the more frequent necrotic tumours, which are the most frequent differential diagnosis in case of ring-enhancing lesions on CT-scan, and should be used to obtain a rapid diagnosis and decide to perform a CT-guided aspiration of the cavity ties). This procedure, which is safe, should be performed if possible before starting antibiotics.; Microbiological diagnosis. - It yields microbiological diagnosis in most cases, in addition to draining the abscess and towering intracranial hypertension. Microbiological diagnosis is there after nearly always obtained, in the absence of prior antibiotics, and thanks to the optimisation of the standard bacterial. cultures, in particular in search of anaerobic bacteria, and with the help, when necessary, of molecular biology techniques, leading to an adapted antibiotic regimen chosen for its good penetration in the brain.; Perspectives. - Nevertheless, because of the small number of prospective works on the subject, many uncertainties remain in the therapeutic field, in particular in terms of duration of antibiotic treatment, the optimal radiological surveillance and the place of associated treatments such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsive therapy.

N2  -  Background Combining MRI techniques with machine learning methodology is rapidly gaining attention as a promising method for staging of brain gliomas. This study assesses the diagnostic value of such a framework applied to dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI in classifying treatment-naive gliomas from a multi-center patients into WHO grades II-IV and across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. Methods Three hundred thirty-three patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary gliomas (IDH-mutant = 151 or IDH-wildtype = 182) were retrospectively identified. Raw DSC-MRI data was post-processed for normalised leakage-corrected relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps. Shape, intensity distribution (histogram) and rotational invariant Haralick texture features over the tumour mask were extracted. Differences in extracted features across glioma grades and mutation status were tested using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. A random-forest algorithm was employed (2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted features. Results Shape, distribution and texture features showed significant differences across mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another. Gliomas were correctly stratified by mutation status in 71% and by grade in 53% of the cases (87% of the gliomas grades predicted with distance less than 1). Conclusions Despite large heterogeneity in the multi-center dataset, machine learning assisted DSC-MRI radiomics hold potential to address the inherent variability and presents a promising approach for non-invasive glioma molecular subtyping and grading.

N2  -  Present knowledge suggests that in glioblastoma multiforme the value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC is elevated in the solid part and hyperintense in T1, in spite of the elevated cellularity, and also in areas where peritumoral vasogenic edema is present. The purpose of our study has been to verify in vivo if the ADC increases in areas of solid tumor because of an increased presence of edema, like it happens in areas surrounding the tumor. Sixteen patients with histologically verified glioblastoma multiforme underwent a magnetic resonance (MR) examination with sequences: T1-weighted pre and post contrast, diffusion-weighted at b = 0 and b = 1000 s/mm(2), perfusion-weighted. One hundred sixty-five regions of interest (ROI) have been obtained for all set of patients. In each ROI we have estimated 4 parameters: ADC, intensity of T2-signal normalised to the white matter (SI(T2W)(n)), regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), T1-signal enhancement (E%). With the SI(T2W). the presence of edema was estimated. For each pair of measured parameters a statistical test of linear regression on the set of all ROI was made. A directed linear correlation between: ADC and SI(T2W)(n) (P less than or equal to 0.001; r = 0.26), E% and SI(T2W)(n) (p less than or equal to 0.001; r = 0.35), E% and ADC (p less than or equal to 0.001; r = 0.33) is present. Also present is an inverse linear correlation between: ADC and rCBV (p less than or equal to 0.05; r = 0.18). Any significant linear correlation between: E% and rCBV (r = 0.01), SI(T2W), and rCBV (r = 0.13) was not found. In areas of solid tumor the increment of the ADC is correlated with the increment of edema: this result can be explained if we assume a three-dimensional diffusion. Furthermore, the increase of ADC is inversely correlated to the rCBV. The E% and the rCBV are statistically independent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose To improve the accuracy of quantitative susceptibility mapping plus quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent magnitude (QSM+qBOLD or QQ) based mapping of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) using temporal clustering, tissue composition, and total variation (CCTV).
Methods Three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo and arterial spin labeling images were acquired from 11 healthy subjects and 33 ischemic stroke patients. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was also obtained from patients. The CCTV mapping was developed for incorporating tissue-type information into clustering of the previous cluster analysis of time evolution (CAT) and applying total variation (TV). The QQ-based OEF and CMRO2 were reconstructed with CAT, CAT+TV (CATV), and the proposed CCTV, and results were compared using region-of-interest analysis, Kruskal-Wallis test, and post hoc Wilcoxson rank sum test.; Results In simulation, CCTV provided more accurate and precise OEF than CAT or CATV. In healthy subjects, QQ-based OEF was less noisy and more uniform with CCTV than CAT. In subacute stroke patients, OEF with CCTV had a greater contrast-to-noise ratio between DWI-defined lesions and the unaffected contralateral side than with CAT or CATV: 1.9 +- 1.3 versus 1.1 +- 0.7 (P = .01) versus 0.7 +- 0.5 (P < .001).; Conclusion The CCTV mapping significantly improves the robustness of QQ-based OEF against noise.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor MRI is used to define trajectories that reflect the long-range order of in vivo white matter (WM) fiber tracts. Fiber tracking is particularly prone to cumulative error from noise and partial volume along the length of the trajectory paths, but the overall shape of each path is anatomically meaningful. By considering only the long-range similarity of path shapes, a method of constructing 3D maps of specific WM structures has been developed. A trajectory is first computed from an operator-selected seed voxel, located within the anatomical structure of interest (SOI). Voxels from the same structure are then automatically identified based on the similarity of trajectory path shapes, assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts in 14 patients with multiple sclerosis, and in 10 healthy controls were mapped by this method, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured. The ADC was significantly higher in patients than in controls, and higher in the corpus callosum than in the pyramidal tracts for both groups. Using this method the different functional structures in the WM may be identified and mapped. Within these maps, MRI parameters can be measured for subsequent comparison with relevant clinical data.

N2  -  The catfish [Ictalurus nebulosus, I. punctatus and Pimelodus clarias] torus semicircularis (TS) comprises 2 major nuclei, which are specialized to process separately inputs of 3 acousticolateral modalities: VIII nerve acoustic input in one, and lateral line mechanoreceptive and electroreceptive input in the other. Electrophysiological recording and mapping experiments demonstrated a medial auditory region, a lateral electroreceptive region and an intercalated mechanoreceptive region in the TS. Nissl and Golgi-Cox preparations distinguished 2 rostrocaudally elongate, nuclear divisions, which correlate, one with the auditory and the other with the mechano- and electroreceptive regions. The medially positioned auditory nucleus is here called the nucleus centralis. The nucleus centralis appears as a rostrally flattened cylinder of uniformly packed cells, covered dorsally and laterally by a fiber rind. Cells within this nucleus conform to 1 of 3 general cell types based upon somatic and dendritic morphology: type 1 cells, which are the most abundant, have a single major primary dendrite and an axon typically arising from the same somatic pole; type 2 cells have 2 major primary dendrites and an axon, which issues from a 3rd distinct somatic pole; and type 3 cells have several major primary dendrites and their axons are associated with one of the major somatic poles. No systematic orientation of dendrites could be found in the nucleus centralis. The laterally positioned lateral line nucleus, to be called the nucleus lateralis, includes 2 subdivisions: a large pars lateralis containing predominantly electroreceptive units, and a smaller, ventromedial pars medialis encompassing predominantly mechanoreceptive units. Each subdivision is somatotopically organized, inputs from the head projecting to rostral areas and inputs from the tail to caudal areas. Although the cell types resemble those described for the nucleus centralis, a greater degree of cytoarchitectural orderliness is discernible: cells in the nucleus lateralis group into 4, alternating cell-poor cell-rich, layers; and the dendritic fields of many type 1 and type 2 cells located in layer II tend to orient in a rostrodorsal-caudoventral attitude, perpendicular to the laminar planes. Fink-Heimer preparations of brains with unilateral, lateral line lobe lesions demonstrated heavy fiber and terminal degeneration confined to the nucleus lateralis on both sides. Lateral line fibers ascend bilaterally in the lateral halves of the lateral lemnisci. At the level of the dorsal oculomotor nucleus the lemniscal fibers in this portion split into 2 fascicles, one proceeding rostrally to innervate the rostral portion of the nucleus lateralis, and the other arching back dorsolaterally to innervate the caudal portions of the nucleus.

N2  -  Background: Prediction of early progression in glioblastoma may provide an opportunity to personalize treatment. Simplified intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI offers quantitative estimates of diffusion and perfusion metrics. We investigated whether these metrics, during chemoradiation, could predict treatment outcome.
Methods: 38 patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastoma undergoing 6-week30-fraction chemoradiation had standardized post-operative MRIs at baseline (radiation planning), and at the 10th and 20th fractions. Non-overlapping TI-enhancing (TIC) and non-enhancing T2-FLAIR hyperintense regions were independently segmented. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(T1C), ADC(T2-FLAIR)) and perfusion fraction (f(T1C), f(T2-FLAIR)) maps were generated with simplified IVIM modelling. Parameters associated with progression before or after 6.9 months (early vs late progression, respectively), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were investigated.; Results: Higher ADC(T2-FLAIR) at baseline Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, p = 0.025, lower f(T2-FLAIR) at fraction 10 (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.04-4.27, p = 0.018), and lack of increase in ADC(T2-FLAIR) at fraction 20 compared to baseline (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p = 0.02) were associated with early progression. Combining ADC(T2-FLAIR) at baseline, f(T2-FLAIR) at fraction 10, ECOG and MGMT promoter methylation status significantly improved AUC to 90.3% compared to a model with only ECOG and MGMT promoter methylation status (p = 0.001). Using multivariable analysis, neither IVIM metrics were associated with OS but higher f(T2-FLAIR) at fraction 10 (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.95, p = 0.018) was associated with longer PFS.; Conclusion: ADC(T2-FLAIR) at baseline, its lack of increase from baseline to fraction 20, or f(T2-FLAIR) at fraction 10 significantly predicted early progression. f(T2-FLAIR )at fraction 10 was associated with PFS.

N2  -  Objective: This study was conducted to assess the benefit of integrating corticospinal tract diffusion tractography into neuronavigation during operations for intra-axial brain tumours located close to the corticospinal tract. Methods: Diffusion tractography was used, together with subcortical electric stimulation, to locate the corticospinal tract. Motor-evoked potentials elicited by stimulation were recorded. The method was used in five patients with intraaxial brain tumour (astrocytoma gr. II-IV). Results: The corticospinal tract was successfully confirmed by electro-stimulation in the approximate location predicted by diffusion tractography in all patients. Resection of the tumour was terminated when motor-evoked potentials were elicited by a stimulus current of 15 mA (monopolar stimulation, train of four pulses at a frequency of 500 Hz and pulse duration of 400 mu s). No patient has since suffered from new permanent neurological deficit. Conclusion: Although we remain convinced that, due to the brain shift that occurs during tumour resection, it is not enough to rely solely on the projections of the corticospinal tract in neuronavigation without electrophysiological validation of the tract course, diffusion tractography integrated into neuronavigation appears to be a valuable guide for the identification of the corticospinal tract in the surgical field.

N2  -  Giant cell tumors were studied by diffusion MR imaging in three patients with tuberous sclerosis. Diffusion MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T unit with a gradient strength of 30 mT/m. b=1000 seconds/mm(2) images, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were studied. ADC values were recorded from ADC maps with particular care to obtain the values from the noncalcified regions of the giant cell tumors. ADC values of the normal brain parenchyma and hamartomas were also recorded by multiple evaluations. The ADC values in all three giant cell tumors (0.78, 0.92, and 0.92x10(-3) mm(2)/s) were within the ranges of the normal brain parenchyma (0.62-1.04x10(-3) mm(2)/s), and they were prominently less than those of parenchymal hamartomas (1.18-1.86x10(-3) mm(2)/s). The finding of ADC values of the noncalcified portions of the giant cell tumors being identical to those of normal brain parenchyma is consistent with the presence of normal molecular motion of water, hence relatively normal tissue integrity within these tumors. This was likely a reflection of benignity of these slowly growing tumors.

N2  -  Background:Microsurgery is a common treatment of brainstem tumors. However, misdirection, vascular damage, nerves injuries, paralysis, even death are all well-known complications, and the risk of adverse events is more likely in less experienced operators. This study was aimed to validate the accuracy of multimodal neuronavigation during microsurgery resection of brainstem tumors.Methods:Ten patients with brainstem tumors underwent preoperative MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, computed tomography, three-dimensional print, and images loaded into the neuronavigation platform were used for its segmentation and preoperative planning. After patients' registration and subsequent surgical exposure, each segmented brain element was validated by manual placement of the navigation probe to the target.Results:Preoperative images of the brain matched with three-dimensional print and neuronavigation played important role in all patients. Excellent correspondence between image-based segmentation and microscope view was also evident at the surface of tumors and at the tumor-normal gland interfaces.Conclusion:Multimodal navigation is a safe and effective method in surgery for patients with brain stem tumors. Our preliminary study is conducted to encourage for future more research with larger numbers of patients.

N2  -  The purpose of our study was to test the accuracy and applicability of decision rules utilizing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios on accurate preoperative diagnosis of common pediatric cerebellar tumors across two institutions.
In this HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved study, performed at two institutions, 140 pediatric cerebellar tumors were included. Two separate reviewers placed regions of interest on the solid components of 140 tumors (98 at site A and 42 at site B) and normal brain on the ADC maps. The third reviewer who was blinded to the histopathological diagnoses made the same measurements on 140 patients to validate the data. Tumor to normal brain ADC ratios were calculated. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was performed to generate thresholds to discriminate tumors. Utility of decision rules based on these thresholds was tested.; While ADC values of medulloblastomas were different between the sites, there was no difference among the ADC ratios of medulloblastomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, ependymomas, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors between the sites. ADC ratio of a parts per thousand yen1.8 correctly discriminated pilocytic astrocytomas from ependymomas with a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.78. ADC ratio of < 1.2 correctly discriminated ependymomas from embryonal tumors with a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.83. The proposed decision rules correctly discriminated 120 of the 140 tumors (85.71 %). Age a parts per thousand yen2 years criterion correctly sorted medulloblastomas in 84.48 % of patients and age < 2 years correctly distinguished atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors in 90.00 % of patients with embryonal tumors.; Decision rules based on ADC ratios are applicable across two institutions in the accurate preoperative diagnosis of common pediatric cerebellar tumors.

N2  -  Purpose: Free-water elimination DTI (FWE-DTI) has been used widely to distinguish increases of free-water partial-volume effects from tissue's diffusion in healthy aging and degenerative diseases. Because the FWE-DTI fitting is only well-posed for multishell acquisitions, a regularized gradient descent (RGD) method was proposed to enable application to single-shell data, more common in the clinic. However, the validity of the RGD method has been poorly assessed. This study aims to quantify the specificity of FWE-DTI procedures on single-shell and multishell data.
Methods: Different FWE-DTI fitting procedures were tested on an open-source in vivo diffusion data set and single-shell and multishell synthetic signals, including the RGD and standard nonlinear least-squares methods. Single-voxel simulations were carried out to compare initialization approaches. A multivoxel phantom simulation was performed to evaluate the effect of spatial regularization when comparing between methods. To test the algorithms' specificity, phantoms with two different types of lesions were simulated: with altered mean diffusivity or with modified free water.; Results: Plausible parameter maps were obtained with RGD from single-shell in vivo data. The plausibility of these maps was shown to be determined by the initialization. Tests with simulated lesions inserted into the in vivo data revealed that the RGD approach cannot distinguish free water from tissue mean-diffusivity alterations, contrarily to the nonlinear least-squares algorithm.; Conclusion: The RGD FWE-DTI method has limited specificity; thus, its results from single-shell data should be carefully interpreted. When possible, multishell acquisitions and the nonlinear least-squares approach should be preferred instead.

N2  -  The visual pathway and its defects have been thoroughly studied in clinical correlation to temporal lobe lesions related to epilepsy and traumatic lesions. Nevertheless, its clinical correlation and other decision making have not been addressed regarding neoplastic lesions. We present a case report of a 28-year-old man with a one-year history of generalized seizures and left superior homonymous quadrantanopia, with no other neurological disturbance on physical examination. According to diffusion tensor imaging tractography, MRI demonstrated a non-enhancing, right temporal lesion disrupting the visual pathway. An awake surgery with direct cortical electrostimulation of visual pathways was performed with subtotal resection of the tumor to preserve visual function, confirmed with postoperative MRI. Histopathological studies revealed a fibrillary astrocytoma.
Surgical technique aided with intraoperative cortical and subcortical stimulation involving low-grade gliomas in eloquent areas is an exceptionally suitable procedure for complex cases where the visual pathway is compromised. Our objective is to describe how intraoperative mapping of visual function is performed in our institution and to comment on the relevant technical nuances, which can serve as a practical guideline for young neurosurgeons, as no previous cases have been reported in our country.

N2  -  The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating the paradigm shift towards patient-tailored brain tumor management, achieving optimal onco-functional balance for each individual. AI-based models can positively impact different stages of the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Although the histological investigation will remain difficult to replace, in the near future the radiomic approach will allow a complementary, repeatable and non-invasive characterization of the lesion, assisting oncologists and neurosurgeons in selecting the best therapeutic option and the correct molecular target in chemotherapy. AI-driven tools are already playing an important role in surgical planning, delimiting the extent of the lesion (segmentation) and its relationships with the brain structures, thus allowing precision brain surgery as radical as reasonably acceptable to preserve the quality of life. Finally, AI-assisted models allow the prediction of complications, recurrences and therapeutic response, suggesting the most appropriate follow-up. Looking to the future, AI-powered models promise to integrate biochemical and clinical data to stratify risk and direct patients to personalized screening protocols.

N2  -  Some microstructure parameters, such as permeability, remain elusive because mathematical models that express their relationship to the MR signal accurately are intractable. Here, we propose to use computational models learned from simulations to estimate these parameters. We demonstrate the approach in an example which estimates water residence time in brain white matter. The residence time tau(i) of water inside axons is a potentially important biomarker for white matter pathologies of the human central nervous system, as myelin damage is hypothesised to affect axonal permeability, and thus tau(i). We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (specifically here a random forest regressor) in order to learn a mapping between features derived from diffusion weighted MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters, including ti. We test our numerical model using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that estimated parameters have strong correlations with the ground truth parameters (R-2 = {0.88, 0.95, 0.82, 0.99}) for volume fraction, residence time, axon radius and diffusivity respectively), and provide a marked improvement over the most widely used Karger model (R-2 = {0.75, 0.60, 0.11, 0.99}). The trained model also estimates sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data acquired from healthy controls, matching values found in literature, and provides better reproducibility than the Karger model on both the voxel and ROI level. Finally, we acquire data from two Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and compare to the values in healthy subjects. We find that in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC-S) the estimate of the residence time is 0.57 +/- 0.05 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CC-S it is 0.33 +/- 0.12 s in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and 0.19 +/- 0.11 s in the lesion. In the corticospinal tracts (CST) the estimate of the residence time is 0.52 +/- 0.09 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CST it is 0.56 +/- 0.05 s in the NAWM and 0.13 +/- 0.09 s in the lesion. These results agree with our expectations that the residence time in lesions would be lower than in NAWM because the loss of myelin should increase permeability. Overall, we find parameter estimates in the two MS patients consistent with expectations from the pathology of MS lesions demonstrating the clinical potential of this new technique.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging-based apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements have been related respectively to both cell and microvessel density in brain tumors. However, because of the high degree of heterogeneity in gliomas, a direct correlation between these MR imaging-based measurements and histopathologic features is required. The purpose of this study was to correlate regionally ADC and rCBV values with both cell and microvessel density in gliomas, by using coregistered MR imaging and stereotactic biopsies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (9 men, 9 women; age range, 19-78 years) with gliomas underwent diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging before biopsy. Eighty-one biopsy samples were obtained and categorized as peritumoral, infiltrated tissue, or bulk tumor, with quantification of cell and microvessel density. ADC and rCBV values were measured at biopsy sites and were normalized to contralateral white matter on corresponding maps coregistered with a 3D MR imaging dataset. ADC and rCBV ratios were compared with quantitative histologic features by using the Spearman correlation test.; RESULTS: The highest correlations were found within bulk tumor samples between rCBV and cell density (r = 0.57, P < 001) and rCBV and microvessel density (r = 0.46, P <.01). An inverse correlation was found between ADC and microvessel density within bulk tumor (r = -0.36, P <.05), whereas no significant correlation was found between ADC and cell density.; CONCLUSION: rCBV regionally correlates with both cell and microvessel density within gliomas, whereas no regional correlation was found between ADC and cell density.

N2  -  To analyse the role of MR diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in characterising tumour boundaries in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Seventeen patients with surgically treated WHO IV grade gliomas who were candidates for adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy were enrolled. Before (T0) and after radiation treatment (T1), they underwent DTI and PWI, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the enhancing tumour, the hyperintense tissue adjacent to the enhancing tumour, and the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) adjacent to the hyperintense areas were analysed. The enhancing tissue at T1 was retrospectively divided on the basis of whether or not it was also enhancing at T0. The controls were the corresponding contralateral areas, on which we normalized the rCBV values, calculating the rCBV ratio. In NAWM, we did not find any significant differences in FA, ADC or rCBV. In the hyperintense perilesional regions, FA was significantly lower and ADC significantly higher than in the unaffected contralateral tissue; there were no significant differences in the rCBV maps. The values of FA, ADC and rCBV in enhancing neoplastic tissue were all significantly different from those observed in the contralateral tissue. There was no significant difference in rCBV values between the areas enhancing at T0 and those not enhancing at T0 but enhancing at T1, which may indicate the neoplastic transformation of apparently normal brain tissue. DTI metrics identify ultrastructural changes in hyperintense perilesional areas, but these are not specific for neoplastic tissue. rCBV seemed to reflect an ultrastructural alteration that was not visible at T0, but became visible (as neoplastic progression) on conventional MR images at T1. These findings could help identify tissue at risk of tumour infiltration.

N2  -  Significance: Imaging Mueller polarimetry (IMP) appears as a promising technique for real-time delineation of healthy and neoplastic tissue during neurosurgery. The training of machine learning algorithms used for the image post-processing requires large data sets typically derived from the measurements of formalin-fixed brain sections. However, the success of the transfer of such algorithms from fixed to fresh brain tissue depends on the degree of alterations of polarimetric properties induced by formalin fixation (FF).
Aim: Comprehensive studies were performed on the FF induced changes in fresh pig brain tissue polarimetric properties.; Approach: Polarimetric properties of pig brain were assessed in 30 coronal thick sections before and after FF using a wide-field IMP system. The width of the uncertainty region between gray and white matter was also estimated.; Results: The depolarization increased by 5% in gray matter and remained constant in white matter following FF, whereas the linear retardance decreased by 27% in gray matter and by 28% in white matter after FF. The visual contrast between gray and white matter and fiber tracking remained preserved after FF. Tissue shrinkage induced by FF did not have a significant effect on the uncertainty region width.; Conclusions: Similar polarimetric properties were observed in both fresh and fixed brain tissues, indicating a high potential for transfer learning.

N2  -  Purpose: This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR) in discriminating between new white matter (WM) enhancing lesions (ELs) and non-enhancing lesions (NELs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Methods: Thirty MS patients with a new solitary WM lesion on brain MRI were analyzed. A region-of-interest was drawn on all lesions and the contralateral normal-appearing WM (NAWM) on T2 FLAIR and ADC maps. Normalized ratios of T2 FLAIR and ADC were calculated by dividing lesion value by the contralateral NAWM. Histogram analysis was performed on the T2 FLAIR, ADC values, and their normalized ratios. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare histogram parameters and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined the area under the curve (AUC).; Results: T2 FLAIR histogram parameters were not significantly different between ELs and NELs. Several EL ADC histogram parameters, including maximum and mean, were significantly higher than NELs (p = 0.006 to p = 0.031). There was a trend toward significantly higher maximum ADC in ELs after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p = 0.054). The standard deviation of T2 FLAIR (AUC 0.70), maximum ADC (AUC 0.79), and normalized maximum ADC ratio (AUC 0.75) were among histogram parameters with the highest diagnostic performance. A maximum ADC cutoff of 1274 x 10(-6) mm(2)s provided a 0.86 sensitivity and 0.75 specificity.; Conclusion: In patients with contraindications to gadolinium or concerns with gadolinium brain deposition, consideration may be given to ADC and T2 FLAIR as potential noncontrast methods for the evaluation of active MS lesions.

N2  -  Focal demyelinated lesions, diffuse white matter (WM) damage, and gray matter (GM) atrophy influence directly the disease progression in patients with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to identify specific characteristics of GM and WM structural networks in subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) in comparison to patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Twenty patients with CIS, 33 with RRMS, and 40 healthy subjects were investigated using 3 T-MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging was applied, together with probabilistic tractography and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps for WM and cortical thickness correlation analysis for GM, to determine the structural connectivity patterns. A network topology analysis with the aid of graph theoretical approaches was used to characterize the network at different community levels (modularity, clustering coefficient, global, and local efficiencies). Finally, we applied support vector machines (SVM) to automatically discriminate the two groups. In comparison to CIS subjects, patients with RRMS were found to have increased modular connectivity and higher local clustering, highlighting increased local processing in both GM and WM. Both groups presented increased modularity and clustering coefficients in comparison to healthy controls. SVM algorithms achieved 97% accuracy using the clustering coefficient as classifier derived from GM and 65% using WM from probabilistic tractography and 67% from modularity of FA maps to differentiate between CIS and RRMS patients. We demonstrate a clear increase of modular and local connectivity in patients with early RRMS in comparison to CIS and healthy subjects. Based only on a single anatomic scan and without a priori information, we developed an automated and investigator-independent paradigm that can accurately discriminate between patients with these clinically similar disease entities, and could thus complement the current dissemination-in-time criteria for clinical diagnosis.

N2  -  Purpose: Seizures related to tumor growth are common in glioma patients, especially in low-grade glioma patients this is often the first tumor manifestation. We hypothesize that there are associations between preoperative seizures and morphologic features (e.g., tumor size, location) and histogram features in patients with glioblastoma (GB). Methods: Retrospectively, 160 consecutive patients with initial diagnosis and surgery of GB (WHO IV) and preoperative MRI were analyzed. Preoperative MRI sequences were co-registered (T2-FLAIR, T1-contrast, DTI) and tumors were segmented by a neuroradiologist using the software ITK-snap blinded to the clinical data. Tumor volume (FLAIR, T1-contrast) and histogram analyses of ADC- and FA-maps were recorded in the contrast enhancing tumor part (CET) and the non-enhancing peritumoral edema (FLAIR). Location was determined after co-registration of the data with an atlas. Permutation-based multiple-testing adjusted t statistics were calculated to compare imaging variables between patients with and without seizures. Results: Patients with seizures showed significantly smaller tumors (CET, adj. p = 0.029) than patients without preoperative seizures. Less seizures were observed in patients with tumor location in the right cingulate gyrus (adj. p = 0.048) and in the right caudate nucleus (adj. p = 0.009). Significant differences of histogram analyses of FA in the contrast enhancing tumor part were observed between patients with and without seizures considering also tumor location and size. Conclusion: Preoperative seizures in GB patients are associated with lower preoperative tumor volume. The different histogram analyses suggest that there might be microstructural differences in the contrast enhancing tumor part of patients with seizures measured by fractional anisotropy. Higher variance of GB presenting without seizures might indicate a more aggressive growth of these tumors.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare clonal, myeloid, neoplastic disorder. Typically, juvenile xanthogranuloma is a self-limited disorder of infancy, often presenting as a solitary red-brown or yellow skin papule/nodule. A small subset of patients present with extracutaneous, systemic juvenile xanthogranuloma, which may include the CNS. The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate and categorize the neuroimaging findings in a representative cohort of pediatric patients with CNS juvenile xanthogranuloma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The brain and/or spine MR imaging data of 14 pediatric patients with pathology-proven juvenile xanthogranuloma were categorized and evaluated for the location; the signal intensity of xanthogranulomas on T1WI, T2WI, DWI, and a matching ADC map for the pattern and degree of contrast enhancement; and the presence of perilesional edema, cysts, or necrosis. RESULTS: Fourteen pediatric patients (8 girls, 6 boys; mean age, 84?months) were included in the study. Patients presented with a wide variety of different symptoms, including headache, seizure, ataxia, strabismus, hearing loss, facial paresis, and diabetes insipidus. Juvenile xanthogranuloma lesions were identified in a number of different sites, including supra- and infratentorial as well as intracranial and spinal leptomeningeal. Five patients were categorized into the neuroradiologic pattern unifocal CNS juvenile xanthogranuloma; 8, into multifocal CNS juvenile xanthogranuloma; and 1, into multifocal CNS juvenile xanthogranuloma with intracranial and spinal leptomeningeal disease. In most cases, xanthogranulomas were small-to-medium intra-axial masses with isointense signal on T1WI (compared with cortical GM), iso- or hyperintense signal on T2WI, had restricted diffusion and perilesional edema. Almost all xanthogranulomas showed avid contrast enhancement. However, we also identified less common patterns with large lesions, nonenhancing lesions, or leptomeningeal disease. Four cases had an additional CT available. On CT, all xanthogranulomas were homogeneously hyperdense (solid component) without evident calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: CNS juvenile xanthogranuloma may demonstrate heterogeneous neuroimaging appearances potentially mimicking other diseases, such as primary brain neoplasms, metastatic disease, lymphoma and leukemia, other histiocytic disorders, infections, or granulomatous diseases.

N2  -  Transient ischemic attack (TIA) has gained significant attention recently due to the increased incidence of subsequent stroke. However, there are many nonvascular clinical mimics of TIA, creating a need for improved biomarkers to identify a vascular origin. Following the recent approval of ultra-high field (UHF) 7T MRI in clinical practice, several clinical studies have highlighted its added utility in neuroimaging compared to lower-field 1.5T and 3T MRI, particularly in epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Our case series of three patients with TIA illustrates that 7T MRI can depict small areas of intracortical microhemorrhages and microinfarctions, which could not be resolved with 3T or 1.5T MRI. There are currently no reports of intracortical localization of microhemorrhages in patients with TIA. This discovery may enhance our understanding and characterization of cerebrovascular abnormalities in TIAs. In addition, UHF imaging could potentially be utilized to distinguish transient neurological episodes secondary to cerebrovascular events from other differential considerations. Our cases highlight the underestimation of imaging abnormalities in cases of TIA and support the potential expanded application of clinical 7T to assess patients with TIA. Future studies are necessary at 7T redundant to determine the true incidence of such lesions in TIA and to examine the correlation between cortical microhemorrhages and subsequent ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic events, and neurocognitive impairment.

N2  -  Mammalian Fat1 is a giant atypical cadherin/tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cellular orientation, migration, and growth. Fat1 is implicated in the development of the brain, eye, and kidney. Altered expression or mutations of FAT1 are also associated with cancer and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Yet, the mechanistic functions of this pathway remain incompletely understood. Here, we report the identification of Sorbin-homology (SoHo) proteins as novel interaction partners of Fat1 by virtue of a yeast-two-hybrid screen. SoHo proteins play diverse roles as adaptor proteins in cell signaling, cell adhesion and sarcomere architecture, including altered expression in cancer and FSHD. Specifically, we found SoHo proteins CAP/ponsin-1 and -2 (Sorbs1) and ArgBP2 (Sorbs2) to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Fat1. We mapped the interaction to a prolin-rich classic type II PXXP motif within Fat1 and to the three Src-homology (SH3) domains within SoHo proteins using mutant expression in yeast, pulldown assays, and cell culture. Functionally, endogenous ponsin-2 expression of NRK-52E cells at cellular leading edges was lost upon knockdown of Fat1. In summary, our data point to an interaction of Fat1 with SoHo proteins that is able to recruit SoHo proteins to sites of Fat1 expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical cerebral-fat embolism shows both reversible and irreversible changes. We used MR imaging to investigate the reversibility of embolized lesions induced with a fat-emulsion technique and to evaluate the histologic findings.
METHODS: A fat emulsion was made with 0.05 mL of triolein and 20 mL of normal saline and vigorous to-and-fro movement through a three-way stopcock. In 50 cats, the internal carotid artery was infused with the fat emulsion. Cats were divided into six groups on the basis of time delay after embolization: 1 hour; 1 and 4 days; and 1, 2, and 3 weeks. MR imaging and histologic examination were performed at these times.; RESULTS: Embolized lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images, isointense or mildly hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, isointense on apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and enhancing on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images at 1 hour. These MR imaging findings were less evident at day 1 and reverted to normal after day 4 (isointense on all images). Electron microscopy showed minimal findings in the cortical lesion in groups 1 and 2 (group 1 at 1 hour and group 2 at 1 hour and 1 day). Light microscopic findings revealed evidence of necrosis-small focal gliosis and demyelination in the periventricular white matter-in only one cat. The number of intravascular fat globules was not significantly different between groups, as visualized by oil red O staining.; CONCLUSION: Cerebral-fat embolism induced by a triolein emulsion revealed reversible MR findings and minimal histologic findings.

N2  -  Background: Cerebellar pathology occurs in late multiple sclerosis (MS) but little is known about cerebellar changes during early disease stages. In this study, we propose a new multicontrast connectometry approach to assess the structural and functional integrity of cerebellar networks and connectivity in early MS. Methods: We used diffusion spectrum and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to establish the structural and functional cerebellar connectomes in 28 early relapsing-remitting MS patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). We performed multicontrast connectometry by quantifying multiple MRI parameters along the structural tracts (generalized fractional anisotropy-GFA, T1/T2 relaxation times and magnetization transfer ratio) and functional connectivity measures. Subsequently, we assessed multivariate differences in local connections and network properties between MS and HC subjects; finally, we correlated detected alterations with lesion load, disease duration, and clinical scores. Results: In MS patients, a subset of structural connections showed quantitative MRI changes suggesting loss of axonal microstructure and integrity (increased T1 and decreased GFA, P<0.05). These alterations highly correlated with motor, memory and attention in patients, but were independent of cerebellar lesion load and disease duration. Neither network organization nor rs-fMRI abnormalities were observed at this early stage. Conclusion: Multicontrast cerebellar connectometry revealed subtle cerebellar alterations in MS patients, which were independent of conventional disease markers and highly correlated with patient function. Future work should assess the prognostic value of the observed damage. Hum Brain Mapp 36:1609-1619, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Study of the corticosubcortical functional anatomy of reading and picture naming.
OBJECTIVE: To study the role of the left basal occipitotemporal area and its white matter pathways.; METHODS: Three patients underwent awake surgery for lesions in the left basal posterotemporal region with intraoperative electrostimulations. Intraoperative testing consisted of naming, reading, and recognition of symbols. Location of the stimulation sites was obtained by comparing the surgical cavity in the postoperative magnetic resonance imaging with the tags precisely located in each one of these sites seen on intraoperative photographs.; RESULTS: A double dissociation was elicited, inducing specific visual recognition and reading disturbances during stimulation in the left posterobasal temporal cortex, without naming impairment. Stimulation of the inferior part of the sagittal stratum (inferior longitudinal fascicle) generated the same response, while a specific picture-naming impairment, consisting of semantic paraphasia, was obtained when stimulating superiorly to this fascicle, over the lateral wall and roof of the ventricle (inferior fronto-occipital fascicle).; CONCLUSION: We propose the existence of a dual visual language route in the left dominant hemisphere. The first pathway seems to run basally, from the occipital lobe to the posterobasal temporal cortex, mediated by the left inferior longitudinal fascicle, subserving visual recognition. The second pathway might run superiorly and more medially, from the occipital pole directly to the frontal areas, and could be underlain by the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, involved in naming (semantic processing). Such a model might have both fundamental and clinical implications for the selection of the tasks during awake mapping as well as for postsurgical rehabilitation.

N2  -  Purpose. A spin-echo diffusion-sensitized pulse sequence using high gradients (23 mT/m) is introduced.
Material and Methods. In order to minimize motion artefacts, velocity-compensating gradients, EGG-triggering and post-processing with phase correction and raw data averaging using navigator echoes was performed. The in vitro ratio of diffusion coefficients for water and acetone was determined and the water self-diffusion coefficient at different temperatures was evaluated. The pulse sequence was tested in 7 healthy volunteers and in 2 tumour patients with astrocytomas of grades I-II and III-IV. Both single-slice and multi-slice techniques were used.; Results. The incorporation of phase correction clearly improved the quality of both diffusion-encoded images and the calculated diffusion maps. Mean values of the diffusion coefficients in vivo were for CSF 2.66x10(-9) m(2)s and for white and grey matter 0.69x10(-9) m(2)s and 0.87x10(-9) m(2)s, respectively.; Conclusion: Velocity-compensating gradients in combination with a high gradient strength were shown to be useful for in vive diffusion MR imaging.

N2  -  Introduction: A connection clip to the ultrasonic aspirator handpiece was introduced for simultaneous resection and mapping of corticospinal motor tract (CST) (Kombos et al., 2001). Research question: To report retrospectively the use of this clip in cerebral surgery with CST mapping.Material and methods: Eight women and four men were included (mean: 55.8 years, SD 17.3 years). The ultrasonic aspirator handpiece was stimulated every second (5 biphasic pulses, 0.4 ms per phase, max 14 mA). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) (Taniguchi et al., 1993), with transcranial and direct cortical stimulation, were alternated with CST mapping. The distances between the stimulus locations to the CST (diffusion tensor imaging based fibre tractography) were determined postoperatively. Muscle strength was evaluated pre-operatively, at discharge and 3 months.Results: Motor mapping thresholds ranged between 2 and 13 mA, in 12 consecutive patients (7 post-central, 5 insular). The distance of the stimulation site to the CST was fitted (y = 0.63x+2.33, R2 = 0.33; x, mA; y, mm), approximating the rule of thumb of 1 mA indicating 1 mm (R2 = 0.22). One patient presented with a deterioration of motor function (wrist, M4+). No intraoperative seizures were observed.Discussion: The concept that 1 mA corresponds to 1 mm from the CST, was roughly observed within this low current range. This rule must be applied, integrating the confidence limits, when getting close to the CST, in conjunction with MEPs.Conclusion: The standardization of this clip, for continuous stimulation of the ultrasonic aspirator with simulta-neous tissue resection, made the guided surgical flow smoother, more refined and very natural.

T2  -  EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY

N2  -  Severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) positively correlates with the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Studies on post-traumatic epileptogenesis would greatly benefit from markers that at acute phase would reliably predict the extent and severity of histologic brain damage caused by TBI in individual subjects. Currently in experimental models, severity of TBI is determined by the pressure of applied load that does not directly reflect the extent of inflicted brain injury, mortality within experimental population, or impairment in behavioral tests that are laborious to perform. We aimed to compare MRI markers measured at acute post-injury phase to previously used indicators of injury severity in the ability to predict the extent of histologically determined post-traumatic tissue damage. We used lateral fluid-percussion injury model in rat that is a clinically relevant model of closed head injury in humans, and results in PTE in severe cases. Rats (48 injured, 12 controls) were divided into moderate (mTBI) and severe (sTBI) groups according to impact strength. MRI data (T2, T2*, lesion volume) were acquired 3 days post-injury. Motor deficits were analysed using neuroscore (NS) and beam balance (BB) tests 2 and 3 days post-injury, respectively. Histological evaluation of lesion volume (Fluoro-jade B) was used as the reference outcome measure, and was performed 2 weeks after TBI. From MRI parameters studied, quantitative T2 values of cortical lesion not only correlated with histologic lesion volume (P<0.001, r=0.6, N=34), as well as NS (P<0.01, r=-0.5, N=34) and BB (P<0.01, r=-0.5. N=34) results, but also successfully differentiated animals with mTBI from those with sTBI 70.6 +/- 6.2 6.2 ms vs. 75.9 +/- 2.6 ms, P<0.001). Quantitative T2 of the lesion early after TBI can serve as an indicator of the severity of post-traumatic cortical damage and neuro-motor impairment, and has a potential as a clinical marker for identification of individuals with elevated risk of PTE.

N2  -  Background: Rapid myelin water imaging (MWI) using a combined gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence can produce myelin specific metrics for the human brain. Spinal cord MWI could be similarly useful, but technical challenges have hindered routine application. GRASE rapid MWI was recently successfully implemented for imaging of healthy cervical spinal cord and may complement other advanced imaging methods, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative T-1 (qT(1)).
Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of cervical cord GRASE rapid MWI in multiple sclerosis (MS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO), with comparison to DTI and qT(1) metrics.; Methods: GRASE MWI, DTI and qT(1) data were acquired in 2 PLS, 1 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 1 primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and 2 NMO subjects, as well as 6 age ( +- 3 yrs) and sex matched healthy controls (HC). Internal cord structure guided template registrations, used for region of interest (ROI) analysis. Z score maps were calculated for the difference between disease subject and mean HC metric values.; Results: PLS subjects had low myelin water fraction (MWF) in the lateral funiculi compared to HC. RRMS subject MWF was heterogeneous within the cord. The PPMS subject showed no trends in ROI results but had a region of low MWF Z score corresponding to a focal lesion. The NMO subject with a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis lesion had low values for whole cord mean MWF of 12.8% compared to 24.3% (standard deviation 2.2%) for HC. The NMO subject without lesions also had low MWF compared to HC. DTI and qT(1) metrics showed similar trends, corroborating the MWF results and providing complementary information.; Conclusion: GRASE is sufficiently sensitive to detect decreased myelin within MS spinal cord plaques, NMO lesions, and PLS diffuse spinal cord injury. Decreased MWF in PLS is consistent with demyelination secondary to motor neuron degeneration. GRASE MWI is a feasible method for rapid assessment of myelin content in the cervical spinal cord and provides complementary information to that of DTI and qT(1) measures.

N2  -  We have recently demonstrated that monolateral lesions of the Nucleus Basalis Mapocellularis (NBM), which is a nucleus sending cholinergic projections to the fronto-parietal cortex, cause a loss in the intensity of Timm staining in the intrahippocampal pathway of mossy fibres (MF). Moreover, these lesions induce ultrastructural changes consistent with the occurrence of degeneration of presynaptic buttons of MF. The present study was designed to quantify the effects of NBM lesioning on the morphology of the presynaptic buttons of MF. Moreover the effects of 4-week choline alfoscerate (alpha-GFC) treatment on the density of Timm staining and on the ultrastructure of presynaptic buttons of MF were assessed. alpha-GFC, which was given at an oral daily dose of 100 mg/kg, is a precursor in the biosynthesis of several brain phospholipids which increases the availability of choline in the nervous tissue. Monolateral lesions of NBM cause, 4 weeks after lesioning, a significant decrease in the intensity of Timm staining in the MF area accompanied by a loss of about 23% of presynaptic buttons of MF. Moreover about 40% of presynaptic buttons of MF show an impaired morphology. Alpha-GFC administration restored the intensity of Timm staining in the MF area. In alpha-GFC-treated rats, the loss of presynaptic buttons and the number of impaired buttons were reduced to about 12% and 27%, respectively in comparison with non-treated animals. These results confirm and extend our previous observations indicative of the occurrence of transneuronal degenerations in the MF of the hippocampus after monolateral NBM lesioning. Moreover these findings show that alpha-GFC treatment is able to counter in part these degenerative changes.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The complex MR imaging appearance of glioblastoma is a function of underlying histopathologic heterogeneity. A better understanding of these correlations, particularly the influence of infiltrating glioma cells and vasogenic edema on T2 and diffusivity signal in nonenhancing areas, has important implications in the management of these patients. With localized biopsies, the objective of this study was to generate a model capable of predicting cellularity at each voxel within an entire tumor volume as a function of signal intensity, thus providing a means of quantifying tumor infiltration into surrounding brain tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-one localized biopsies were obtained from 36 patients with glioblastoma. Signal intensities corresponding to these samples were derived from T1-postcontrast subtraction, T2-FLAIR, and ADC sequences by using an automated coregistration algorithm. Cell density was calculated for each specimen by using an automated cell-counting algorithm. Signal intensity was plotted against cell density for each MR image.; RESULTS: T2-FLAIR (r = -0.61) and ADC (r = -0.63) sequences were inversely correlated with cell density. T1-postcontrast (r = 0.69) subtraction was directly correlated with cell density. Combining these relationships yielded a multiparametric model with improved correlation (r = 0.74), suggesting that each sequence offers different and complementary information.; CONCLUSIONS: Using localized biopsies, we have generated a model that illustrates a quantitative and significant relationship between MR signal and cell density. Projecting this relationship over the entire tumor volume allows mapping of the intratumoral heterogeneity in both the contrast-enhancing tumor core and nonenhancing margins of glioblastoma and may be used to guide extended surgical resection, localized biopsies, and radiation field mapping.

N2  -  The posterior visual pathway is commonly affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology that results in measurable clinical and electrophysiological impairment. Due to its highly structured retinotopic mapping, the visual pathway represents an ideal substrate for investigating patho-mechanisms in MS. Therefore, a reliable and robust imaging segmentation method for in-vivo delineation of the optic radiations (OR) is needed. However, diffusion based tractography approaches, which are typically used for OR segmentation are confounded by the presence of focal white matter lesions. Current solutions require complex acquisition paradigms and demand expert image analysis, limiting application in both clinical trials and clinical practice. In the current study, using data acquired in a clinical setting on a 3T scanner, we optimised and compared two approaches for optic radiation (OR) reconstruction: individual probabilistic tractography-based and template-based methods. OR segmentation results were applied to subjects with MS and volumetric and diffusivity parameters were compared between OR segmentation techniques. Despite differences in reconstructed OR volumes, both OR lesion volume and OR diffusivity measurements in MS subjects were highly comparable using optimised probabilistic tractography-based, and template-based, methods. The choice of OR reconstruction technique should be determined primarily by the research question and the nature of the available dataset. Template-based approaches are particularly suited to the semi-automated analysis of large image datasets and have utility even in the absence of dMRI acquisitions. Individual tractography methods, while more complex than template based OR reconstruction, permit measurement of diffusivity changes

N2  -  Purpose Children with brain tumors experience cognitive late effects, often related to cranial radiation. We sought to determine differential effects of surgery and chemotherapy on brain structure and neuropsychological outcomes in children who did not receive cranial radiation therapy (CRT).
Methods Twenty-eight children with a history of posterior fossa tumor (17 treated with surgery, 11 treated with surgery and chemotherapy) underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment a mean of 4.5 years (surgery group) to 9 years (surgery + chemotherapy group) posttreatment, along with 18 healthy sibling controls. Psychometric measures assessed IQ, language, executive functions, processing speed, memory, and social-emotional functioning. Group differences and correlations between diffusion tensor imaging findings and psychometric scores were examined.; Results The z-score mapping demonstrated fractional anisotropy (FA) values were >= 2 standard deviations lower in white matter tracts, prefrontal cortex gray matter, hippocampus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and pons between patient groups, indicating microstructural damage associated with chemotherapy. Patients scored lower than controls on visuoconstructional reasoning and memory (P <= .02). Lower FA in the uncinate fasciculus (R = -0.82 to -0.91) and higher FA in the thalamus (R = 0.73-0.91) associated with higher IQ scores, and higher FA in the thalamus associated with higher scores on spatial working memory (R = 0.82).; Conclusions Posterior fossa brain tumor treatment with surgery and chemotherapy affects brain microstructure and neuropsychological functioning years into survivorship, with spatial processes the most vulnerable. Biomarkers indicating cellular changes in the thalamus, hippocampus, pons, prefrontal cortex, and white matter tracts associate with lower psychometric scores.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Polymyositis (PM) mainly involves proximal limb and trunk muscles. Ocular muscles are not affected, except in rare cases, with both PM and myasthenia gravis (MG). Thus, the results of laboratory examinations in such a patient deserve to be reported.
METHODS: To analyze the clinical, imaging and pathology datas on a 65-year-old woman patient with PM with complex symptoms, who presented mainly ophthalmoplegia. The patient consented to all examinations and the hospital Ethics Committee approved the study. The laboratory examinations included creatine kinase (CK), ENA, tumor marker, function of thyroid, cranial MRI, and electromyogram (EMG). Biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris was performed, frozen specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, ATPase, NADH tetrazolium reductase, periodic acid Schiff, oil red 0, modified Gomory trichrome and MHC-I, to investigate the pathology of muscle fibers.; RESULTS: Laboratory results showed: CK, 108.32 mu katL; antinuclear antibody: (+); ENA, (-); tumormarker (-); normal thyroid function, MRI showed no abnormal signals in brain and extraocular muscles. Electromyography of the bilateral deltoid, biceps brachii, musculus quadriceps fexoris, anterior tibialis showed fibrillation potentials, positive potentials and short-duration, small-amplitude polyphasic potentials on voluntary movements with a full interference pattern on mild exertion. Repetitive stimulation did not result in any increment or decrement in these potentials, A muscle biopsy of the left quadriceps femoris showed many small round muscle fibers without peripheral bundle distribution and apparent myofiber degeneration, necrosis and phagocytosis. There were several focal lymphocyte infiltrations. MHC-I immunohistochemical staining was positive in most fibers revealing inflammatory infiltration of normal fibers with MHC-I expression.; CONCLUSION: This patient showed increased CK, typical triad of myopathy in EMG, and apparent degeneration and necrosis in biopsy of quadriceps femoris. Therefore, the diagnosis of PM and involvement of extraocular muscles were definite.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Brain mapping during awake craniotomy is a well-known technique to preserve neurological functions, especially the language. It is still challenging to map the optic radiations due to the difficulty to test the visual field intraoperatively. To assess the visual field during awake craniotomy, we developed the Functions' Explorer based on a virtual reality headset (FEX-VRH).
METHODS: The impaired visual field of 10 patients was tested with automated perimetry (the gold standard examination) and the FEX-VRH. The proof-of-concept test was done during the surgery performed on a patient who was blind in his right eye and presenting with a left parietotemporal glioblastoma. The FEX-VRH was used intraoperatively, simultaneously with direct subcortical electrostimulation, allowing identification and preservation of the optic radiations.; RESULTS: The FEX-VRH detected 9 of the 10 visual field defects found by automated perimetry. The patient who underwent an awake craniotomy with intraoperative mapping of the optic tract using the FEX-VRH had no permanent postoperative visual field defect.; CONCLUSION: Intraoperative visual field assessment with the FEX-VRH during direct subcortical electrostimulation is a promising approach to mapping the optical radiations and preventing a permanent visual field defect during awake surgery for epilepsy or tumor.

N2  -  Object To evaluate the efficacy and safety of trans-sulcal or fissure approach in surgical treatment of supratentorial lesions Study design Retrospective clinical case series Methods This study included 42 patients. Age ranged from 4 to 78 years. Sulcal dissection was done in 26 patients at or near the eloquent areas, and in 16 patients, it was done in non-eloquent areas. Diffusion tensor tractography, neuronavigation, and intraoperative monitoring were applied for lesions at the motor areas. The follow-up period was 24 months. Results Gross total excision could be achieved in 52% of patients. Sulcal dissection was easy in 26 patients with the lax brain. The outcome, according to the Karnofsky scale, was 100 in 21/42 (50%). Complications were transient deterioration of function in three patients, and immediate post-operative hemorrhage in two patients. Three patients became seizure-free after surgery. Conclusion The trans-sulcal dissection is a safe, useful, and applicable approach. Through which it is possible to reach deeply seated lesions. It preserves the motor functions, provides wider exposure, minimizes the need of brain retraction during surgery, and preserves the gyral layers. Complications are usually transient, specially in the presence of preoperative diffusion tensor tractography, intraoperative neuronavigation, and monitoring.

N2  -  Background Intraoperative use of the intraluminal shunt may reduce the risk of a stroke by reducing cerebral blood flow compromise, but it may also increase the risk of atherosclerotic arterial wall damage with subsequent stroke during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There is still no evidence to support routine or selective shunting.
Material and Methods A total of 754 CEAs were performed in a prospective study from 2005 to 2011 at our department. All procedures were done under regional anesthesia with selective carotid artery shunting according to neurologic status after internal carotid artery clamping. Magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of brain parenchyma using diffusion-weighed imaging (DWI) sequence was performed upon hospital admission and 24 hours after the surgical procedure. Acute new MR DWI lesions were evaluated according to the classification published by Szabo et al. A routine neurologic evaluation was recorded as well.; Results The intraluminal shunt was used in 46 of 754 patients (6.1%). A new ischemic lesion was detected in 45 patients (6%). Most of these lesions were neurologically asymptomatic (80%). A new lesion on MR DWI in the subgroup of shunted patients was detected in 15 cases (32.6%) and in the subgroup of nonshunted patients in 30 cases (4.2%). Most of these lesions were due to embolization or hypoperfusion during shunt insertion.; Conclusion Use of the intraluminal shunt was the most important risk factor for the new MR DWI lesion in the entire group of CEAs. Results support the strategy of a selective use of intraluminal shunts.

N2  -  PurposeTo evaluate the performance of endogenous chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectra and derived maps in a longitudinal study of tumor xenografts to ascertain the role of CEST parameters in describing tumor progression and in distinguishing between tumor, muscle, and necrosis.
MethodsCEST spectra of 24 mice with tumor xenografts (20 LLC and 4 MDA) were acquired at three time-points. We employed a novel method of decomposing the CEST spectrum into a sum of four Lorentzian shapes, each with a corresponding measured amplitude, width and frequency offset. This semi-quantitative method is an improvement over techniques which simply assess the asymmetry in the spectrum for the presence of CEST, due to the fact that it is not confounded by CEST peaks on opposing sides of the direct effect. The CEST images were compared to several other commonly employed contrast mechanisms: T-1 relaxation, T-2 relaxation, diffusion (ADC), and magnetization transfer (MT).; ResultsTumor spectra had distinct CEST peaks corresponding to the presence of hydrogen exchange between free water and amide, amine, and aliphatic groups. All three CEST peaks (amide, amine, and aliphatic) were larger in the tumor tissue as compared with the adjacent healthy muscle.; ConclusionsCEST contrast (particularly the amine peak amplitude) performed especially well in distinguishing areas of apoptosis andor necrosis from actively progressing tumor, as validated by histology.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A substantial portion of clinically diagnosed TIA cases is imaging-negative. The purpose of the current study is to determine if arterial spin-labeling is helpful in detecting perfusion abnormalities in patients presenting clinically with TIA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling with 3D background-suppressed gradient and spin-echo was acquired on 49 patients suspected of TIA within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients were free of stroke history and had no lesion-specific findings on general MR, DWI, and MRA sequences. The calculated arterial spin-labeling CBF maps were scored from 1-3 on the basis of presence and severity of perfusion disturbance by 3 independent observers blinded to patient history. An age-matched cohort of 36 patients diagnosed with no cerebrovascular events was evaluated as a control. Interobserver agreement was assessed by use of the Kendall concordance test.; RESULTS: Scoring of perfusion abnormalities on arterial spin-labeling scans of the TIA cohort was highly concordant among the 3 observers (W = 0.812). The sensitivity and specificity of arterial spin-labeling in the diagnosis of perfusion abnormalities in TIA was 55.8% and 90.7%, respectively. In 93.3% (7075) of the arterial spin-labeling CBF map readings with positive scores (2), the brain regions where perfusion abnormalities were identified by 3 observers matched with the neurologic deficits at TIA onset.; CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, arterial spin-labeling showed promise in the detection of perfusion abnormalities that correlated with clinically diagnosed TIA in patients with otherwise normal neuroimaging results.

N2  -  Objective Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is associated with cognitive and motor deficits whose pathogenesis is not well understood. F-18-Flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) might be used to investigate putative functional correlates in the brain.
Methods Whole-body FDG PET including the brain had been performed in 29 NF1 patients suspected for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (20 females, nine males, age 31.2 +- 11.8 years). Twenty-nine age-matched and sex-matched subjects without evidence of neurologicalpsychiatric disease in whom FDG PET had been performed for NF1-unrelated oncological indication served as controls. Individual brain FDG retention images were stereotactically normalized and scaled to a common median retention value within the brain. Scaled FDG retention was compared between the NF1 group and the control group on a voxel-by-voxel base using ANCOVA in SPM2 with the FDG uptake period as covariate. The corrected significance level alpha=0.05 was used. Voxel-based analysis was complemented by volume of interest (VOI)-based analysis using predefined standard VOIs.; Results The voxel-based group comparison revealed a significant reduction of scaled FDG retention in the thalamus of the NF1 subjects within a cluster of 11.6 ml There were no further significant effects, neither hypo-retention nor hyper-retention. Reduction of relative FDG retention in the thalamus in the NF1 subjects was confirmed by VOI analysis. The magnitude of the reduction was about 8%.; Conclusions The thalamus appears to be affected in adults with NF1. The observed magnitude of the reduction of scaled thalamic FDG retention in adults is smaller than previously reported in children. This may be consistent with a stabilization of the disease process with age.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most frequent and serious complications of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) are ischemic lesions caused by thromboembolic events. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging appears to be the most sensitive technique for detecting early ischemic phenomena. We evaluated this technique for the detection of brain changes in patients who underwent GDC treatment of aneurysms.
METHODS: Twenty patients with a cerebral aneurysm were studied with diffusion-weighted imaging before and after endovascular treatment with GDCs, Aneurysms were located in the anterior (n = 16) or posterior (n = 4) circulation. Bleeding had occurred in 11 patients. MR studies, including fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted sequences, were scheduled before, 2 to 4 hours after, and 48 hours after treatment. MR images, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, were assessed for the presence of acute ischemic stroke lesions.; RESULTS: In all patients, the aneurysm was excluded without neurologic worsening. In 18 patients, diffusion-weighted and FLAIR images showed no evidence of recent ischemic lesions after treatment. In one patient, an asymptomatic frontobasal hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted images with a drop of ADC values corresponding to an acute ischemic lesion was observed. In another patient, multiple silent lesions were seen on diffusion-weighted images after embolization, These silent lesions were not all located in the vascular territory of the aneurysm's parent artery.; CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that diffusion-weighted MR imaging is a potentially useful tool for monitoring patients after endovascular treatment of a cerebral aneurysm, While small asymptomatic lesions can be observed on these images after embolization, their exact prevalence should be evaluated in a larger series.

N2  -  The trail making test part B (TMT-B) is one of the most widely used task for the assessment of set-shifting ability in patients. However, the set of brain regions impacting TMT-B performance when lesioned is still poorly known. In this case report, we provide a multimodal analysis of a patient operated on while awake for a diffuse low-grade glioma located in the right supramarginal gyrus. TMT-B performance was probed intraoperatively. Direct electrical stimulation of the white matter in the depth of the resection generated shifting errors. Using the recent methodology of axono-cortical-evoked potentials (ACEP), we demonstrated that the eloquent fibers were connected to the posterior end of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). This was further confirmed by a tractography analysis of the postoperative diffusion MRI. Finally, the functional connectivity maps of this MTG seed were assessed in both pre- and post-operative resting state MRI. These maps matched with the Control network B (13th) and Default B (17th) from the 17-networks parcellation of (Yeo et al., 2011). Last but not least, we showed that the dorsal attention B (6th), the control A & B networks (12th and 13th) and the default A (16th) have been preserved here but disconnected after a more extensive resection in a previous glioma case within the same area, and in whom TMT-B was definitively impaired. Taken together, these data support the need of a network-level approach to identify the neural basis of the TMT-B and point to the Control network B as playing an important role in set-shifting.

N2  -  Background: Functional motor conversion disorders are characterized by neurological symptoms unrelated to brain structural lesions. The present study was conducted on a woman presenting motor symptoms causing motor dysfunction, using advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques, electrophysiological and neuropsychological assessment. Methods. The patient underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with both task and resting-state paradigms and was compared with 11 healthy matched controls. To test differences in structural parameters, Bayesian comparison was performed. To test differences in functional parameters, a first- and second-level analysis was performed in task fMRI, while a seed-to-seed analysis to evaluate the connections between brain regions and identify intersubject variations was performed in resting-state fMRI. Results. FDG-PET showed two patterns of brain metabolism, involving the cortical and subcortical structures. Regarding the diffusion data, microstructural parameters were altered for U-shape fibers for the hand and feet regions. Resting-state analysis showed hypoconnectivity between the parahippocampal and superior temporal gyrus. Neurophysiological assessment showed no alterations. Finally, an initial cognitive impairment was observed, paralleled by an anxiety and mild depressive state. Conclusions. While we confirmed no structural alterations sustaining this functional motor disorder, we report microstructural changes in sensory-motor integration for both the hand and feet regions that could functionally support clinical manifestations.

N2  -  Brain imaging has recently evidenced that the structural state of distinct reciprocal cortico-cerebellar fiber tracts, the dentato-thalamo-cortical tract (DTCT), and the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract (CPCeT), significantly influences residual motor output in chronic stroke patients, independent from the level of damage to the corticospinal tract (CST). Whether such structural information might also directly relate to measures of cortical excitability is an open question. Eighteen chronic stroke patients with supratentorial ischemic lesions and 17 healthy controls underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess recruitment curves of motor evoked potentials of both hemispheres. Diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography were applied to reconstruct reciprocal cortico-cerebellar motor tracts between the primary motor cortex and the cerebellum. Tract-related microstructure was estimated by means of fractional anisotropy, and linear regression modeling was used to relate it to cortical excitability. The main finding was a significant association between cortical excitability and the structural integrity of the DTCT, the main cerebellar outflow tract, independent from the level of damage to the CST. A comparable relationship was neither detectable for the CPCeT nor for the healthy controls. This finding contributes to a mechanistic understanding of the putative supportive role of the cerebellum for residual motor output by facilitating cortical excitability after stroke.

N2  -  Primary brain lymphoma is the most common opportunistic CNS tumour in AIDS patients followed by Kaposi's sarcoma and gliomas and often is the disease revealing the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The incidence of primary brain lymphoma has increased constantly in the last two decades, currently accounting for 6.6-15.4% of all primary brain tumours against the 3.3% recorded before 1978. Its frequency in AIDS patients is between 3% and 10%. Primary brain lymphoma is still relatively rare, making up only 0.7-0.9% of all lymphomas.; Primary brain lymphomas mainly arise in the supratentorial region (90%, especially in the periventricular grey matter and in the white matter; localisation in the posterior cranial fossa is estimated to be around 10%. Leptomeningeal involvement occurs in around 12% of cases; dural involvement is rarer and spinal cord involvement rarer still (around 1%). On the contrary, secondary lymphomas ten to invade the dura mete and leptomeninges.; Primary brain lymphomas in AIDS are multifocal in 50-75% of cases. Since 1991 there has been an almost constant association of Epstein-Barr virus with these tumours in immunocompromised patients. suggesting that this virus could be used as a diagnostic marker for primary brain lymphoma.; Macroscopically, primary brain lymphomas are nodular masses varying in consistency from friable to solid with a granular surface. The lesion if often surrounded by oedema and spreads to the leptomeninges and subpial regions. The tumour is multifocal in 11-50% of immunocompetent patients and 41-81% of AIDS patients, sometimes reaching 100%.; Histological analysis shows uniform layers of closely packed tumour cells. Infiltration extents well beyond the macroscopic margins of the lesion. Necrosis and haemorrhage are much more common in immunocompromised patients.; At neuroradiological investigation the tumours are typically hyperdense in CT scans due to the high nucleus-cytoplasm ration and large number of closely packed cells.; After contrast administration virtually all brain lymphomas show enhancement varying in intensity and sometimes barely visible unless special windows are used. T1-weighted MR scans typically show hypo-isointensity in relation to the grey matter with a mild mass effect depending on tumour size.; Early literature reports described these lesions as almost uniformly hyperintense in T2-weighted images. More recently, software advances have improved the visualisation of in details so that the tumours mainly appear iso-hypointense in relation to they grey matter in T2 caused by the high nucleus-cytoplasm ratio and the large number of closely packed cells as in CT scans. At MR in patients without AIDS, brain lymphomas almost constantly show contrast enhancement which is homogeneous in 23 of cases. In AIDS patients the tumours show contrast uptake in 100% of cases, inhomogeneous in 54%, with an annular pattern in 46% and irregular uptake in 8%. One of the characteristic features of primary brain lymphoma is the tendency to spread along ther ependyma, meninges or both. This diffusion is seen in varying percentages up to 75%, 28% showing contiguity with the ependymal surface and 8% with the meninges.

N2  -  Background: Little is known about temporal and spatial progression of the stroke-like lesion during the acute stage of the stroke-like episode in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Methods: In four stroke-like episodes of MELAS observed in three patients, MRI, EEG, and SPECT were studied consecutively within the first month of the onset. Results: The first presenting symptoms were headache in all four stroke-like episodes, followed by hemianopsia, psychosis, and aphasia. In three episodes, epileptic seizure developed subsequently in close association with a progression of stroke-like lesion. In all four episodes, serial MRI showed a slowly progressive spread of the stroke-like lesion evolving from the temporal cortex to the surrounding parietal or occipital cortex over a few weeks following the onset of initial symptoms. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps showed slightly decreased ADC values in the actively evolving brain lesions compared with those in nonaffected regions of the brain. EEG showed a pattern of focal periodic epileptiform discharges in three episodes. SPECT showed a focal hyperemia in all four stroke-like lesions, in two of which focal hyperemia persisted for the first month. A T1-weighted hyperintense cortical signal on MRI compatible with cortical laminar necrosis was seen during the subacute stage of all stroke-like lesions. Conclusion: Slowly and progressively spreading stroke-like lesions on MRI may reflect ongoing neuronal metabolic derangement associated with concomitant vasogenic edema provoked by prolonged epileptic seizure activities.

N2  -  BackgroundRecurrence in glioblastoma patients often occur close to the original tumour and indicates that the current treatment is inadequate for local tumour control. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using multi-modality imaging at the time of radiotherapy planning. Specifically, we aimed to identify parameters from pre-treatment PET and MRI with potential to predict tumour recurrence.Materials and methodsSixteen patients were prospectively recruited and treated according to established guidelines. Multi-parametric imaging with F-18-FET PET/CT and F-18-FDG PET/MR including diffusion and dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion MRI were performed before radiotherapy. Correlations between imaging parameters were calculated. Imaging was related to the voxel-wise outcome at the time of tumour recurrence. Within the radiotherapy target, median differences of imaging parameters in recurring and non-recurring voxels were calculated for contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL), non-enhancing lesion (NEL), and normal appearing grey and white matter. Logistic regression models were created to predict the patient-specific probability of recurrence. The most important parameters were identified using standardized model coefficients.ResultsSignificant median differences between recurring and non-recurring voxels were observed for FDG, FET, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, mean transit time, extra-vascular, extra-cellular blood volume and permeability derived from scans prior to chemo-radiotherapy. Tissue-specific patterns of voxel-wise correlations were observed. The most pronounced correlations were observed for F-18-FDG- and F-18-FET-uptake in CEL and NEL. Voxel-wise modelling of recurrence probability resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 from scans prior to therapy. Overall, FET proved to be the most important parameter for recurrence prediction.ConclusionMulti-parametric imaging before radiotherapy is feasible and significant differences in imaging parameters between recurring and non-recurring voxels were observed. Combining parameters in a logistic regression model enabled patient-specific maps of recurrence probability, where F-18-FET proved to be most important. This strategy could enable risk-adapted radiotherapy planning.

N2  -  Although the thalamus is not considered primarily as a limbic structure, abundant evidence indicates the essential role of the thalamus as a modulator of limbic functions indirectly through the amygdala. The amygdala is a central component of the limbic system and serves an essential role in modulating the core processes including the memory, decision-making, and emotional reactions. The amygdalothalamic pathway is the largest direct amygdalo-diencephalic connection in the primates including the human brain. Given the crucial role of the amygdalothalamic tract (ATT) in memory function and diencephalic amnesia in stroke patients, diffusion tensor imaging may be helpful in better visualizing the surgical anatomy of this pathway noninvasively. To date, few diffusion-weighted studies have focused on the amygdala, yet the fine neuronal connection of the amygdala and thalamus known as the ATT has yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the utility of high spatial resolution diffusion tensor tractography for mapping the trajectory of the ATT in the human brain. We studied 15 healthy right-handed human subjects (12 men and 3 women with age range of 24-37 years old). Using a high-resolution diffusion tensor tractography technique, for the first time, we were able to reconstruct and measure the trajectory of the ATT. We further revealed the close relationship of the ATT with the temporopontine tract and the fornix bilaterally in 15 healthy adult human brains.

N2  -  Objective: In patients with tumor-related epilepsy (TRE), surgery traditionally focuses on tumor resection; but identification and removal of associated epileptogenic zone may improve seizure outcome. Here, we study spatial relationship of tumor and seizure onset and early spread zone (SOSz). We also perform quantitative analysis of interictal epileptiform activities in patients with both TRE and non-lesional epilepsy in order to better understand the electrophysiological basis of epileptogenesis.
Methods: Twenty-five patients (11 with TRE and 14 with non-lesional epilepsy) underwent staged surgery using intracranial electrodes. Tumors were outlined on MRI and images were coregistered with post-implantation CT images. For each electrode, distance to the nearest tumor margin was measured. Electrodes were categorized based on distance from tumor and involvement in seizure. Quantitative EEG analysis studying frequency, amplitude, power, duration and slope of interictal spikes was performed.; Results: At least part of the SOSz was located beyond 1.5 cm from the tumor margin in 1011 patients. Interictally, spike frequency and power were higher in the SOSz and spikes near tumor were smaller and less sharp. Interestingly, peritumoral electrodes had the highest spike frequencies and sharpest spikes, indicating greatest degree of epileptic synchrony. A complete resection of the SOSz resulted in excellent seizure outcome.; Conclusions: Seizure onset and early spread often involves brain areas distant from the tumor.; Significance: Utilization of epilepsy surgery approach for TRE may provide better seizure outcome and study of the intracranial EEG may provide insight into pathophysiology of TRE.

N2  -  Neurosurgery has traditionally been overtly focused on the study of anatomy and functions of cortical areas with microsurgical techniques aimed at preserving eloquent cortices. In the last two decades, there has been ever-increasing data emerging from advances in neuroimaging (principally diffusion tensor imaging) and clinical studies (principally from awake surgeries) that point to the important contribution of white matter tracts (WMT) that influence neurological function as part of a brain network. Major scientific consortiums worldwide, currently working on this human brain connectome, are providing evidence that is dramatically altering the manner in which we view neurosurgical procedures. The development of the telencephalic flexure, a major landmark during the human embryogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS), severely affects the cortical/subcortical anatomy in and around the sylvian fissure and thus the different interacting brain networks. Indeed, the telencephalic flexure modifies the anatomy of the human brain with the more posterior areas becoming ventral and lateral and associative fibers connecting the anterior areas with the previous posterior ones follow the flexure, thus becoming semicircular. In these areas, the projection, association, and commissural fibers intermingle with some WMT remaining curved and others longitudinal. Essentially the ultimate shape and location of these tracts are determined by the development of the telencephalic flexure. Five adult human brains were dissected (medial to lateral and lateral to medial) with a view to describing this intricate anatomy. To better understand the 3D orientation of the WMT of the region we have correlated the cadaveric data with the anatomy presented in the literature of the flexure during human neuro-embryogenesis in addition to cross-species comparisons of the flexure. The precise definition of the connectome of the telencephalic flexure is primordial during glioma surgery and for disconnective epilepsy surgery in this region.

N2  -  In an attempt to clarify whether T-1 relaxation time mapping may assist in characterizing the pathological brain tissue substrate of multiple sclerosis (MS), we compared the T-1 relaxation times of lesions, areas of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) located proximal to lesions, and areas of NAWM located distant from lesions in 12 patients with the relapsing - remitting and 12 with the secondary progressive (SP) subtype of disease. Nine healthy volunteers served as controls. Calculated mean T-1 values were averaged across all patients within each clinical group, and comparisons were made by means of the Mann - Whitney U-test. Significant differences were found between all investigated brain regions within each clinical subgroup. Significant differences were also detected for each investigated brain region among clinical subgroups. While T-1 values of NAWM were significantly higher in patients with SP disease than in normal white matter (NWM) of controls, no differences were detected when corresponding brain areas of patients with RR MS were compared with NWM of controls. T-1 maps identify areas of the brain that are damaged to a different extent in patients with MS, and may be of help in monitoring disease progression.

N2  -  Purpose: Tumor characterization employing a voxel-wise analysis of image signal facilitates the determination of the spatial distribution of tumor attributes, and when employed for therapy response assessment offers the promise of greater sensitivity to change than conventional approaches. However, the accuracy of a voxel-wise analysis of change is limited by local registration uncertainties that can disrupt the spatiotemporal correspondence between assessed voxels. We present a method for assessing voxel correspondence strength using a multiresolution local histogram-based measure of image structure similarity. When employed in a longitudinal tumor imaging context, a voxel similarity measure must be robust to intensity variations that can arise from the image acquisition, treatment effects, or changes in underlying disease processes. Consequently, the local histogram-based similarity measure is evaluated for sensitivity to structural change and robustness to intensity variation and is compared against normalized mutual information and normalized cross-correlation.
Methods: T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance (MR) images of glioblastoma acquired as part of a longitudinal response assessment study are first rigidly registered, and then similarity between spatially corresponding voxels is evaluated using multiresolution local histograms. Region-based and nonuniform intensity changes of varying magnitude as well as deformations to image structure are applied individually and in combination to the test images. Statistical analysis is used to test for interaction effects between the applied perturbations and the value of the local histogram similarity function. Pair-wise voxel similarity maps are computed for pairs of longitudinal clinical MR image volumes and compared with observed patterns of change on conventional imaging.; Results: The simulations demonstrated that the local histogram measure was robust to intensity modulations applied to increasing region sizes and exhibited a strong negative correlation with the magnitude of local deformation. No statistically significant interaction effects were observed upon the value of the local histogram similarity function when deformation was applied in conjunction with a nonuniform intensity change. Pair-wise voxel similarity maps were consistent with image change observed on T1W MR imaging and revealed patterns of change not apparent in conventional image sequences.; Conclusions: A measure of local histogram image structure similarity can be used to assess the strength of voxel to voxel correspondences independently of intensity nonuniformities. The metric can provide a local estimate of the limits of achievable correspondence underlying the registration and voxel-wise comparison of signal in longitudinal imaging used for assessing tumor response to treatment.

N2  -  Background: Although pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) enables the reliable qualitative grading of brain tumors, its use in quantification for glioma grading may be hampered by the limited interobserver variability associated with low spatial resolution.
Purpose: To assess the interobserver variability and diagnostic accuracy of the relative tumor perfusion signal intensity (rTPS) calculated using PASL in glioma grading.; Material and Methods: Fifty-eight patients with 61 cerebral astrocytomas underwent conventional MR imaging and PASL. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to determine the optimum thresholds for tumor grading. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for identifying high-grade gliomas were also calculated. Cohen's statistic was used to determine the levels of interobserver variability in the quantitative analysis of PASL.; Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for determining a high-grade glioma with conventional MR imaging were 77.1, 73.1, 79.4, and 70.4%, respectively. A threshold value of 1.28 for rTPS provided a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 82.9, 96.2, 96.7, and 80.6%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the rTPS between low- and high-grade astrocytomas (1.14 vs. 1.47, P<0.05). In the interobserver variability analysis, substantial agreement was obtained for the quantitative rTPS measurement from PASL (kappa =0.72).; Conclusion: Quantitative perfusion measurement with PASL can improve the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative glioma grading, as compared to the application of conventional imaging alone. However, the interobserver variability for quantification is substantial.

N2  -  In adults, partial damage to V1 or optic radiations abolishes perception in the corresponding part of the visual field, causing a scotoma. However, it is widely accepted that the developing cortex has superior capacities to reorganize following an early lesion to endorse adaptive plasticity. Here we report a single patient case (G.S.) with near normal central field vision despite a massive unilateral lesion to the optic radiations acquired early in life. The patient underwent surgical removal of a right hemisphere parieto-temporal-occipital atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the right lateral ventricle at four months of age, which presumably altered the visual pathways during in utero development. Both the tumor and surgery severely compromised the optic radiations. Residual vision of G.S. was tested psychophysically when the patient was 7 years old. We found a close-to-normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity within the central 25 degrees and a great impairment in form and contrast vision in the far periphery (40-50 degrees) of the left visual hemifield. BOLD response to full field luminance flicker was recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) and in a region in the residual temporal-occipital region, presumably corresponding to the middle temporal complex (MT+), of the lesioned (right) hemisphere. A population receptive field analysis of the BOLD responses to contrast modulated stimuli revealed a retinotopic organization just for the MT+ region but not for the calcarine regions. Interestingly, consistent islands of ipsilateral activity were found in MT+ and in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) of the intact hemisphere. Probabilistic tractography revealed that optic radiations between LGN and V1 were very sparse in the lesioned hemisphere consistently with the post-surgery cerebral resection, while normal in the intact hemisphere. On the other hand, strong structural connections between MT+ and LGN were found in the lesioned hemisphere, while the equivalent tract in the spared hemisphere showed minimal structural connectivity. These results suggest that during development of the pathological brain, abnormal thalamic projections can lead to functional cortical changes, which may mediate functional recovery of vision.

N2  -  There has been little investigation on the association between cognitive impairment and the microbleeds (MBs) frequently seen in subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). One possible mechanism of cognitive decline in individuals with SVaD could be disruption of cholinergic fibers by vascular lesions. Central cholinergic circuits in human brain can be tested non-invasively by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) of motor cortex. In the present study, we used this test in SvaD patients with and without MBs. SAI was evaluated in 13 SVaD patients with MBs (MB-positive group) and the data were compared with those from a group of 15 SVaD patients without MBs (MB-negative group) and with those from 20 healthy subjects. Moreover, we studied covariation of individual SAI values with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score and subscores. SAI was significantly reduced in the MB-positive group when compared with the MB-negative group and the control subjects. Total MMSE score, "attention and calculation" and "orientation" subscores were significantly lower in the MB-positive group than in the MB-negative group; SAI showed a positive correlation with total MMSE score. Adjustment for age, gender, education, presence of lacunae, severe white matter hyperintensities or severe periventricular hyperintensities did not affect these findings. This study provides novel physiological evidence that MBs have an impact on central cholinergic function that is independent of the extent of associated white matter changes and ischaemic stroke. This finding shows that TMS have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. TMS studies may help in evaluating the causes of cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular diseases.

N2  -  We aimed to investigate optimal perfusion thresholds defining ischemic core and penumbra for hemispheric-cortical gray matter (GM) and subcortical white matter (WM). A total of 65 sub-6 h ischemic stroke patients were assessed, who underwent acute computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and acute magnetic resonance imaging. CTP maps were generated by both standard singular value deconvolution (sSVD) and SVD with delay and dispersion correction (ddSVD). Analyses were undertaken to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for each CTP threshold for core and penumbra in GM and WM. With sSVD, the core was best defined in GM by cerebral blood flow (CBF) < 30% (AUC: 0.73) and in WM by CBF < 20% (AUC: 0.67). With ddSVD, GM core was best defined by CBF < 35% (AUC: 0.75) and in WM by CBF < 25% (AUC: 0.68). A combined GM/WM threshold overestimated core compared to diffusion-weighted imaging, CBF < 25% from sSVD (1.88 ml, P = 0.007) and CBF < 30% from ddSVD (1.27 ml, P = 0.011). The perfusion lesion was best defined by T-max > 5 s (AUC: 0.80) in GM and T-max > 7 s (AUC: 0.75) in WM. With sSVD, a delay time (DT) > 3 s from ddSVD was the optimal for both GM (AUC: 0.78) and WM (AUC: 0.75). Using tissue-specific thresholds for GM/WM provides more accurate estimation of acute ischemic core.

N2  -  An effective method for in vivo detection of early therapeutic response of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would enable personalized clinical management of cancer therapy and facilitate the design of optimal treatment regimens. This study evaluates the feasibility of T-weighted MRI (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for in vivo detection of response of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice to chemotherapy. Each cycle of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, Oncovin, prednisone, and bryostatin 1 (CHOPB) was administered to tumor-carrying mice weekly for up to four cycles. T2WI and DWI were performed before the initiation of CHOPB and after each cycle of CHOPB. In order to corroborate the MRI results, histological analyses were carried out on control tumors and treated tumors after completion of all MRI studies. DWI revealed a significant (P < 0.03) increase in the mean apparent diffusion coefficient in CHOPB-treated tumors as early as 1 week after initiation of CHOPB. However, a significant (P < 0.03) decrease in mean T, was observed only after two cycles of CHOPB. Both MRI methods produced high-resolution (0.1 x 0.1 x 1.0 mm(3)) maps of regional therapeutic response in the treated tumors based on local apparent diffusion coefficient and T-2. Only a specific region of the tumors (in 3 of the 5 tumors) corresponding to about one third of the turner volume exhibited a response-associate increase in ADC and decrease in T,. An adjacent region exhibited an increase in T-2, and no change in ADC. The rest of the tumor was indistinguishable from sham-treated controls by MRI criteria. The therapeutic response of the treated tumors detected by MRI was accompanied by changes in tumor cell density, proliferation and apoptosis revealed by histological studies performed upon completion of the longitudinal study. The mechanism producing the regional response of the tumor remains to be elucidated. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to determine whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics including tensor shape measures such as linear and planar anisotropy coefficients (CL and CP) can help differentiate glioblastomas from solitary brain metastases. Sixty-three patients with histopathologic diagnosis of glioblastomas (22 men, 16 women, mean age 58.4 years) and brain metastases (13 men, 12 women, mean age 56.3 years) were included in this study. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), CL and CP maps were co-registered and each lesion was semi-automatically subdivided into four regions: central, enhancing, immediate peritumoral and distant peritumoral. DTI metrics as well as the normalized signal intensity from the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were measured from each region. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the best model for classification. The results demonstrated that FA, CL and CP from glioblastomas were significantly higher than those of brain metastases from all segmented regions (p<0.05), and the differences from the enhancing regions were most significant (p<0.001). FA and CL from the enhancing region had the highest prediction accuracy when used alone with an area under the curve of 0.90. The best logistic regression model included three parameters (ADC, FA and CP) from the enhancing part, resulting in 92% sensitivity, 100% specificity and area under the curve of 0.98. We conclude that DTI metrics, used individually or combined, have a potential as a non-invasive measure to differentiate glioblastomas from metastases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  HMW proteins (high MW, compared to that of tubulin), were studied by immunochemical techniques in primary nerve cells cultures, established cell lines and tumor cell lines from a variety of tissues and species [mouse fibroblast 3T3 cell, neurospinal explanted cells (glial, neuronal and fibroblast), embryonal carcinoma PCC-3/A/1 cell, endodermic PYS-2 cell, mesenchyme-like PCC 3/A/1D1 cell, rat glial G6 cell, rat kangaroo kidney epithelium-like PTK-2 cell, and human epithelial SA52 cell]. The protein bands of 350,000 and 300,000 MW, isolated from porcine brain microtubules by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS [sodium dodecyl sulfate]. The corresponding specific antibodies were eluted from an immunoadsorbent constituted of electrophoretically pure HMW. Double immunodiffusion immunoprecipitation using total brain microtubules and autoradiography techniques shows that there is no homology between HMW and Tau protein; 2 antibody preparations used in this work react with MAP1 [microtubule associated protein] (350,000 MW) and, with 2 polypeptides that migrate as the slowest components of MAP2, and could be considered as degradation products of MAP1. The intensity and the localization of the HMW immunofluorescence labeling in the cell differ from those of tubulin. The distribution of HMW seems to be dependent upon the cell shape and the treatment undergone by the cell. The anti-MAP1 antibodies are localized by EM around in vitro reassembled microtubules, while in vivo they are always found dispersed in the cytoplasm, with a tendency to concentrate in the perinuclear region. In mobile cells, the immunofluorescent staining, specific for MAP1, is observed along certain actin cables, ruffles, microspikes and filopodes. In resting cells (fully spread-out cells), the MAP1 staining does not cover stress fibers nor adhesion zones. Following extraction of cells with Triton X-100 in a microtubule-stabilization-buffer, the MAP1 are distributed along the microtubular network. Apparently, MAP1 is not distributed solely along microtubules but also on other cellular elements.

N2  -  Object. Recently, intraoperative mapping has disclosed that, in addition to the classic language centers (that is, the Broca and Wernicke centers), other cortical regions may also play an important role in language organization. In the prefrontal cortex, although the lateral superior frontal gyms (LSFG) could have language-related functions, there are no detailed reports that demonstrate the anatomical connection between the LSFG and other well-known language cortices, such as the Broca center. To show the existence of the structural connection, white matter association fibers between the inferior frontal gyms (IFG) and the LSFG were examined using fiber dissection (FD) and diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based tractography.
Methods. Eight cadaveric cerebral hemispheres were dissected to reveal the association fibers between the IFG and LSFG. The DT imaging based tractography studies targeting the prefrontal cortex were obtained in 53 right-handed patients who had no organic cerebral lesions.; Results. The association fiber tract between Brodmann area 4445 (the Broca center in the dominant hemisphere) and LSFG were detected in all specimens by FD. In the DT imaging based tractography studies, the tract was identified in all patients bilaterally, except for the 4 in whom the tract was detected only in the left hemisphere. This tract was spread significantly wider in the left than in the right hemisphere, and left lateralization was evident in male patients.; Conclusions. Based on its character, this tract was named the Broca-LSFG pathway. These findings suggest a close relationship between this pathway and language organization. The structural anatomy of the Broca-LSFG pathway may explain speech disturbances induced by LSFG stimulation that are sometimes observed during intraoperative language mapping.

N2  -  Purpose: This study aimed to identify brain areas with white matter changes that contribute to motor recovery of affected limbs during acute to sub-acute phases of subcortical infarction.
Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed 1, 4, and 12 weeks after stroke onset in 18 patients with acute subcortical infarct, and in 18 age- and risk factor-matched controls. Fugl-Meyer scale was used to assess levels of motor impairment, and Statistical Parametric Mapping was applied to determine fractional anisotropy (FA) changes for the entire brain in order to identify areas correlated with motor recovery.; Results: Fugl-Meyer scores of patients at 4 and 12 weeks were significantly higher than those at 1 week (all p < 0.01). Accompanying with the progressive decreases of FA in the corticospinal tract above and below the stroke lesion, progressive increases of FA in the contralesional medial frontal gyrus, and thalamocortical connections including projections to the somatosensory cortices, primary motor cortex, and premotor areas, were positively correlated with Fugl-Meyer scores (all p < 0.005) within 12 weeks following acute subcortical infarction.; Conclusions: Remodeling of white matter in contralesional brain regions related to motor, cognition, and sensory processing may facilitate early motor recovery in patients with an acute infarct.

N2  -  Objective: The use of regorafenib in recurrent glioblastoma patients has been recently approved by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) and added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2020 guidelines as a preferred regimen. Given its complex effects at the molecular level, the most appropriate imaging tools to assess early response to treatment is still a matter of debate. Diffusion-weighted imaging and O-(2-F-18- fluoroethyl)- L-tyrosine positron emission tomography ([18F]FET PET) are promising methodologies providing additional information to the currently used RANO criteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variations in diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and [F-18]FET PET-derived parameters in patients who underwent PET/MR at both baseline and after starting regorafenib.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 16 consecutive GBM patients who underwent F-18FET PETMR before and after two cycles of regorafenib. Patients were sorted into stable (SD) or progressive disease (PD) categories in accordance with RANO criteria. We were also able to analyze four SD patients who underwent a third PETMR after another four cycles of regorafenib. F-18FET uptake greater than 1.6 times the mean background activity was used to define an area to be superimposed on an ADC map at baseline and after treatment. Several metrics were then derived and compared. Log -rank test was applied for overall survival analysis.; Results: Percentage difference in FET volumes correlates with the corresponding percentage difference in ADC (R = 0.54). Patients with a twofold increase in FET after regorafenib showed a significantly higher increase in ADC pathological volume than the remaining subjects (p = 0.0023). Kaplan-Meier analysis, performed to compare the performance in overall survival prediction, revealed that the percentage variations of FET-and ADC-derived metrics performed at least as well as RANO criteria (p = 0.02, p = 0.024 and p = 0.04 respectively) and in some cases even better. TBR Max and TBR mean are not able to accurately predict overall survival.; Conclusion In recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with regorafenib, F-18FET and ADC metrics, are able to predict overall survival and being obtained from completely different measures as compared to RANO, could serve as semi-quantitative independent biomarkers of response to treatment. Advances in knowledge Simultaneous evaluation of F-18FET and ADC metrics using PETMR allows an early and reliable identification of response to treatment and predict overall survival.

N2  -  There are many infectious and inflammatory processes affecting the central nervous system that can simulate other neurosurgical pathologies (e.g. tumor) and may precipitate a brain biopsy for definitive diagnosis if not suspected a priori. The challenge for the healthcare team is to recognize imaging features that support a nonsurgical pathology to avoid unnecessary interventions. This review aims to give a general overview of some common inflammatory and infectious entities that affect the central nervous system, with illustrative examples and highlighting important pearls and pitfalls.

N2  -  Objective: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been useful in radiotherapy treatment planning (RIP) especially in tumor delineation. Routinely, 2D/3D MRSI data are used for this application. However, not all centers have access to 2D/3D MRSI. The objective of this study was to introduce a method of using single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) data in target delineation and assess its reliability.
Methods: A gel-based phantom containing Creatine (Cr), N-acetyl-l-aspartic-acid (NAA), and Choline (Cho) was designed and built. The metabolite ratios simulate the normal and tumoral part of the brain. The jMRUI software (v. 6.0) was used to simulate a 1.5 T GE MRI scanner. The metabolite spectra provided by different time of echos (TE)s of the Point-RESolved Spectroscopy pulse-sequence (PRESS), different data-points, and post-processings were quantized by IMRUI. PseudoMRSI maps of ChoCr, NAACr, and Cho + CrNAA were created. A conformity index (CI) was used to determine which metabolite-ratio isolines are more appropriate for tumor delineation.; Results: The simulation accuracy was verified. There were no differences > 4% between the measured and simulated spectra in peak regions. The pseudoMRSI map of Cho + CrNAA smoothly followed the complicated geometry of the tumor inside the gel-based phantom, The results showed that the single-voxel spectra produced by the PRESS pulse sequence with the TE of 144 ms, 512 data-points, and minimum post-processings of water suppression, eddy current correction, and baseline correction can be used for target delineation.; Conclusion: This study suggests that SVS data can be used to aid target delineation by using a mathematical approach. This can enable a wider use of MR-derived information in radiotherapy.; Advances in knowledge: To the best of our knowledge, until now, 2D or 3D MRSI data provided from 3T MRI scanners have been used for MRS-based radiotherapy treatment planning. However, there are a lot of centers that are equipped to 1.5 T MRI scanners and some of them just equipped to SVS. This study introduces a mathematical approach to help these centers to take the benefits of MRS-based treatment planning.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) may cause cognitive and neuropsychological impairment and hence objective assessment of adverse effects of radiation may be valuable to plan therapy. The purpose of our study was to determine the potential of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting subacute radiation induced injury to the normal brain.; MATERIALS AND METHODS; Four patients with brain metastases and three patients with lung cancer underwent cranial irradiation. These patients were subjected to 3D-EPSI and DTI at two time points (pre-radiation, and 1 month post-irradiation). Parametric maps of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated and co-registered to post-contrast T1-weighted images. Normal appearing gray-matter and white-matter regions were compared between the two time points to assess sub-acute effects of radiation using independent sample t-tests.; RESULTS; Significantly increased MD (P = .02), ChoCr (P = .02) and a trend towards a decrease in NAACr (P = .06) was observed from the hippocampus. Significant decrease in FA (P = .02) from the centrum-semiovale and a significant increase in MD (P = .04) and ChoCr (P = .02) from genu of corpus-callosum was also observed.; CONCLUSIONS; Our preliminary findings suggest that 3D-EPSI and DTI may provide quantitative measures of radiation induced injury to the normal brain.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Recent studies advocate a connectivity pattern wider than previously believed of the uncinate fasciculus that extends to the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These new percepts on the connectivity of the tract suggest a more expansive role for the ncinate fasciculus. Our aim was to shed light on this controversy through fiber dissections. METHODS: Twenty normal adult human formalin-fixed cerebral hemispheres were used. Focused dissections on the insular, orbitofrontal, ventromedial, ventrolateral, and dorsolateral prefrontal areas were performed to record the topography of the frontal terminations of the uncinate fasciculus. RESULTS: Three discrete fiber layers were consistently disclosed: the first layer was recorded to terminate at the posterior orbital gyrus and pars orbitalis, the second layer at the posterior two thirds of the gyrus rectus, and the last layer at the posterior one third of the paraolfactory gyrus. The insular apex was documented as a crucial landmark regarding the topographic differentiation of the uncinate and occipitofrontal fasciculi (i.e., fibers that travel ventrally belong to the uncinate fasciculus whereas those traveling dorsally are occipitofrontal fibers). CONCLUSIONS: The frontal terminations of the uncinate fasciculus were consistently documented to project to the posterior orbitofrontal area. The area of the insular apex is introduced for the first time as a crucial surface landmark to effectively distinguish the stems of the uncinate and occipitofrontal fasciculi. This finding could refine the spatial resolution of awake subcortical mapping, especially for insular lesions, and improve the accuracy of in vivo diffusion tensor imaging protocols.

N2  -  Knowledge of the relationship between structure and function is essential to the exploration of the architecture of cognition. Cognitive processes require the coordinated activity of large-scale brain networks consisting of distant cortical regions, connected by long-range white matter tracts. Despite decades of connectional tracing studies in monkeys, the backwardness of human anatomy makes it difficult to draw conclusions from lesion studies and functional neuroimaging when brain connectivity is at issue. We propose an approach to clinico-anatomical correlation, based on a standardized atlas of white matter tracts derived from diffusion tensor imaging tractography. Using OVER-TRACK, a method based on tracking and overlapping white matter tracts, we mapped the course of three rostro-caudal association pathways in the Montreal Neurological Institute space. For each voxel we defined the probability of finding fibers belonging to individual tracts. This method is defined to localize in the white matter the overlapping lesion derived from a group of patients with brain damage. Our study provides a general approach for establishing anatomo-functional correlations by estimating the cortical areas connected in normal subjects, or disconnected by white matter lesions. This method will help researchers and clinicians to identify the neural bases of cognitive abilities and the behavioral consequences of brain lesions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson Srl.

N2  -  Physiological evidence indicates that central cholinergic pathways are involved in the regulation of cerebral cortical blood flow. We investigated the possible contribution of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons from the substantia innominata (SI) to the innervation of cortical microvessels. Basalo-cortical perivascular nerve terminals were detected by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) following its injection in the SI, and were compared to cortical perivascular cholinergic (immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)) terminals, The basal forebrain origin of cholinergic terminals was evaluated after unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the St, PHA-L varicose fibers reached and surrounded microvessels in all cortical subdivisions examined, When studied at the ultrastructural level in the fronto-parietal and perirhinal cortices, perivascular PHA-L nerve terminals were located significantly closer to microvessels in the fronto-parietal than in the perirhinal cortex (respective average distance of 0.98 +/- 0.09 and 1.34 +/- 0.07 mu m; p < 0.01), PHA-L and ChAT terminals in the fronto-parietal cortex compared very well in their perivascular distribution but not in the perirhinal cortex, In both cortices, perivascular PHA-L terminals were similar in size to, but engaged more frequently in synaptic contacts than their ChAT counterparts, Following SI lesion, the density of cortical ChAT terminals including those reaching microvessels decreased significantly (56 and 63%, respectively, p < 0.005) in the fronto-parietal cortex, while the cortical and perivascular denervations were much less pronounced (26%, not significant and 35%, p < 0.05, respectively) in the perirhinal cortex, These results indicate that basal forebrain neurons project preferentially to fronto-parietal cortical microvessels and further show that a significant proportion of these projections are cholinergic, In addition, the difference in distribution and/or synaptic incidence between perivascular PHA-L and ChAT terminals suggested that noncholinergic SI neurons also contribute to these neurovascular associations, and more so in the perirhinal cortex, as further indicated by the lesion studies, Such finding corroborates recent physiological evidence for a functional innervation of the cortical microvascular bed by SI neurons, a role that might be relevant to the overall pathology of Alzheimer's dementia.

N2  -  Objective: To characterize isolated upper extremity (UE) weakness from stroke. Methods: In our Get with the Guidelines-Stroke dataset (n = 7643), 87 patients (1.14%) had isolated UE weakness and underwent thorough stroke evaluation with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and good-quality arterial imaging. We analyzed clinical-imaging features, etiology, management, and outcome. Since isolated UE weakness is typically associated with contralateral hand-knob area infarcts, patients were classified into Group-A (motor strip infarct) or Group-B (non-motor strip infarct). Results: The mean age was 68 years; 66% were male, 72% had hypertension, 22% diabetes, 53% hyperlipidemia, and 16% were smokers. In Group-A (n = 71), 18 patients had single and 53 had multiple infarcts involving the contralateral motor strip. In Group-B (n = 16), 6 patients had contralateral subcortical white matter infarcts, 9 had bihemispheric infarcts and 1 had a brainstem infarct. Compared to Group-B, patients in Group-A more often had carotid artery stenosis or irregular plaque (84.5% versus 50%, P = .006) and large-artery atherosclerosis mechanism (46% versus 19%, P = .05), and less often cardioembolic mechanism (13% versus 44%, P = .008). Among 36 patients with large-artery mechanism, 27 had less than 70% stenosis including 19 with plaque ulceration/thrombus. Recurrent strokes occurred in 10 patients (11.5%), including 5 with mild-moderate carotid stenosis and plaque ulceration/thrombosis, over 1515 days follow-up. Conclusion: Stroke mechanism in acute isolated UE weakness is variable. Contralateral motor-strip infarcts are associated with carotid stenosis, often with plaque ulceration ("vulnerable carotid plaque"), and infarcts in other locations with cardioembolism. Recurrent stroke risk is high especially with mild-moderate carotid artery stenosis and plaque ulceration/thrombus.

N2  -  Visual neglect is a heterogeneous, multi-component syndrome resulting from right hemisphere damage. Neglect patients do not pay attention to events occurring on their left side, and have a poor functional outcome. The intra-hemispheric location of lesions producing neglect is debated, because studies using different methods reported different locations in the grey matter and in the white matter of the right hemisphere. These reported locations show various patterns of overlapping with the fronto-parietal attention networks demonstrated by functional neuroimaging. We explored the anatomical correlates of neglect patients' performance on distinct tests of neglect. For the first time in neglect anatomy studies, we individually assessed 25 patients with subacute strokes in the right hemisphere, by using a combined structural and diffusion tensor deterministic tractography approach, with separate analyses for each neglect test. The results revealed that lesions in nodes of the ventral attention network (angular and supramarginal gyri) were selectively associated with deficits in performance on all the tests used; damage to other structures correlated with impaired performance on specific tests, such as the bells test (middle and inferior frontal gyri), or the reading test (temporal regions). Importantly, however, white matter damage proved crucial in producing neglect-related deficits. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and tractography consistently revealed that damage to the ventral branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III) and to the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) predicted pathological scores on line bisection/drawing copy and on the bells test, respectively. Moreover, damage to distinct sectors of SLF III, or combined SLF/IFOF damage, gave rise to different performance profiles. Our results indicate that both grey and white matter lesion analysis must be taken into account to determine the neural correlates of neglect-related deficits. They also suggest that damage to distinct portions of white matter tracts may give rise to distinct clinical signs of neglect, presumably by inducing dysfunction of partly overlapping, but distinct networks.

N2  -  Although a variety of diffeomorphic deformable registration methods exist in the literature, application of these methods in the presence of space-occupying lesions is not straightforward. The motivation of this work is spatial normalization of MR images from patients with brain tumors in a common stereotaxic space, aiming to pool data from different patients into a common space in order to perform group analyses. Additionally, transfer of structural and functional information from neuroanatomical brain atlases into the individual patient's space can be achieved via the inverse mapping, for the purpose of segmenting brains and facilitating surgical or radiotherapy treatment planning. A method that estimates the brain tissue loss and replacement by tumor is applied for achieving equivalent image content between an atlas and a patient's scan, based on a biomechanical model of tumor growth. Automated estimation of the parameters modeling brain tissue loss and displacement is performed via optimization of an objective function reflecting feature-based similarity and elastic stretching energy, which is optimized in parallel via APPSPACK (Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search). The results of the method, applied to 21 brain tumor patients, indicate that the registration accuracy is relatively high in areas around the tumor, as well as in the healthy portion of the brain. Also, the calculated deformation in the vicinity of the tumor is shown to correlate highly with expert-defined visual scores indicating the tumor mass effect, thereby potentially leading to an objective approach to quantification of mass effect, which is commonly used in diagnosis.

N2  -  The current study aimed to investigate the use of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as a noninvasive probe for assessing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) efficacy in 32 high-grade glioma patients (HGGs). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed pre- and post-CRT, and FA and MD maps were constructed with Philips MRI 1.5 T beside Intellispace software. Tumor regression and progression were assessed by changes in tumor size monitored with T1-contrast enhancement, with 15 cases (46.9%) demonstrating regression and 17 cases (53.1%) showing progression. The cut-off values of mean pre- CRT FA and MD in the tumor core were 0.345 and 0.957 x 10-3 mm2/s, respectively, with a sensitivity of 73.3% and 86.7% and a specificity of 70.6% and 52.9%. In the peritumoral zone, the mean values of pre-FA and MD were 0.415 and 1.21 x 10-3 mm2/s, respectively, with a sensitivity of 93.3% and 86.7% and a specificity of 76.5% for both. Comparatively, the cutoff values of mean after CRT FA and MD in the tumor core were 0.295 and 0.965 x 10-3 mm2/s, respectively, with a sensitivity of 99.2% and 98.1% and a specificity of 94.1% and 93.1%. Higher post-CRT FA and MD values were associated with better treatment response rates, indicating that FA and MD are valuable DTI metrics for assessing CRT efficacy in HGG regression and progression without invasive procedures.

N2  -  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by widespread damage of the central nervous system that includes alterations in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and demyelinating white matter (WM) lesions. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) has been proposed to provide a precise characterisation of WM microstructures. NODDI maps can be calculated for the Neurite Density Index (NDI) and Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), which estimate orientation dispersion and neurite density. Although NODDI has not been widely applied in MS, this technique is promising in investigating the complexity of MS pathology, as it is more specific than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in capturing microstructural alterations. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies using NODDI metrics to assess brain microstructural changes and neuroaxonal pathology in WM lesions and NAWM in patients with MS. Three reviewers conducted a literature search of four electronic databases. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis and the extent of between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Funnel plots and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. We identified seven studies analysing 374 participants (202 MS and 172 controls). The NDI in WM lesions and NAWM were significantly reduced compared to healthy WM and the standardised mean difference of each was -3.08 (95%CI -4.22 to (-1.95), p <= 0.00001, I2 = 88%) and -0.70 (95%CI -0.99 to (-0.40), p <= 0.00001, I2 = 35%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference of the ODI in MS WM lesions and NAWM compared to healthy controls. This systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that the NDI is significantly reduced in MS lesions and NAWM than in WM from healthy participants, corresponding to reduced intracellular signal fraction, which may reflect underlying damage or loss of neurites.

N2  -  Brain metastasis is one of the most common diagnoses encountered by neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and oncologists. The aim of this article is to review imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and follow-up of brain metastases. Through the use of various imaging techniques more accurate preoperative diagnosis and more precise intraoperative planning can be made. Post-treatment evaluation can also be refined through the use of these imaging techniques.

N2  -  Background
Extent of resection is believed to be a key prognostic factor in neuro-oncology. Image guided surgery uses a variety of tools or technologies to help achieve this goal. It is not clear whether any of these, sometimes very expensive, tools (or their combination) should be recommended as part of standard care for patient with brain tumours. We set out to determine if image guided surgery offers any advantage in terms of extent of resection over surgery without any image guidance and if any one tool or technology was more effective.; Objectives; To compare image guided surgery with surgery either not using any image guidance or to compare surgery using two different forms of image guidance. The primary outcome criteria was extent of resection and adverse events. Other outcome criteria were overall survival; progression free survival; and quality of life (QoL).; Search methods; The following databases were searched, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2013), MEDLINE (1948 to March, week 10, 2013) and EMBASE (1970 to 2013, week 10). Reference lists of all identified studies were searched. Two journals, the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology, were handsearched from 1991 to 2013, including all conference abstracts. Neuro-oncologists, trial authors and manufacturers were contacted regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.; Selection criteria; Study participants included patients of all ages with a presumed new or recurrent brain tumour (any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or both). Image guidance interventions included intra-operative MRI (iMRI); fluorescence guided surgery; neuronavigation including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); and ultrasonography. Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with comparisons made either with patients having surgery without the image guidance tool in question or with another type of image guidance tool. Subgroups were to include high grade glioma; low grade glioma; brain metastasis; skull base meningiomas; and sellar or parasellar tumours.; Data collection and analysis; Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a pre-specified pro forma.; Main results; Four RCTs were identified, each using a different image guided technique: 1. iMRI (58 patients), 2. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescence guided surgery (322 patients), 3. neuronavigation (45 patients) and 4. DTI-neuronavigation (238 patients). Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to differences in the tumours included (eloquent versus non-eloquent locations) and variations in the image guidance tools used in the control arms (usually selective utilisation of neuronavigation). There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies, especially for the study using DTI-neuronavigation. All studies included patients with high grade glioma, with one study also including patients with low grade glioma. The extent of resection was increased with iMRI (risk ratio (RR) (incomplete resection) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.96, low quality evidence), 5-ALA (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71) and DTI-neuronavigation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.63, very low quality evidence). Insufficient data were available to evaluate the effects of neuronavigation on extent of resection. Reporting of adverse events was incomplete, with a suggestion of significant reporting bias. Overall, reported events were low in most studies, but there was concern that surgical resection using 5-ALA may lead to more frequent early neurological deficits. There was no clear evidence of improvement in overall survival (OS) with 5-ALA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07) or DTI-neuronavigation (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.00) in patients with high grade glioma. Progression-free survival (PFS) data were not available in the appropriate format for analysis.; Data for quality of life (QoL) were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias.; Authors' conclusions; There is low to very low quality evidence (according to GRADE criteria) that image guided surgery using iMRI, 5-ALA or DTI-neuronavigation increases the proportion of patients with high grade glioma that have a complete tumour resection on post-operative MRI. There is a theoretical concern that maximising the extent of resection may lead to more frequent adverse events but this was poorly reported in the included studies. Effects of image guided surgery on survival and QoL are unclear. Further research, including studies of ultrasound guided surgery, is needed.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter lesions are commonly found in patients with Fabry disease. Existing studies have shown elevated diffusivity in healthy-appearing brain regions that are commonly associated with white matter lesions, suggesting that DWI could help detect white matter lesions at an earlier stage This study explores whether diffusivity changes precede white matter lesion formation in a cohort of patients with Fabry disease undergoing yearly MR imaging examinations during a 5-year period.MATERIALS AND METHODS: T1-weighted anatomic, FLAIR, and DWI scans of 48 patients with Fabry disease (23 women; median age, 44?years; range, 15?69 years) were retrospectively included. White matter lesions and tissue probability maps were segmented and, together with ADC maps, were transformed into standard space. ADC values were determined within lesions before and after detection on FLAIR images and compared with normal-appearing white matter ADC. By means of linear mixed-effects modeling, changes in ADC and Delta ADC (relative to normal-appearing white matter) across time were investigated.RESULTS: ADC was significantly higher within white matter lesions compared with normal-appearing white matter (P,.01), evenbefore detection on FLAIR images. ADC and Delta ADC were significantly affected by sex, showing higher values in men (60.1 [95% CI,23.8-96.3]x10(-6)mm(2)/s and 35.1 [95% CI, 6.0-64.2]x10(-6)mm(2)/s), respectively. Delta ADC increased faster in men compared with women(0.99 [95% CI, 0.27-1.71]x10(-6)mm(2)/s/month). Delta ADC increased with time even when only considering data from before detection(0.57 [95% CI, 0.01-1.14]x10(-6)mm(2)/s/month).<!--?.01), even before detection on FLAIR images. ADC and ?ADC were significantly affected by sex, showing higher values in men (60.1 [95% CI, 23.8?96.3] ?10?6mm2/s and 35.1 [95% CI, 6.0?64.2] ?10?6mm2/s), respectively. ?ADC increased faster in men compared with women (0.99 [95% CI, 0.27?1.71] ?10?6mm2/s/month). ?ADC increased with time even when only considering data from before detection (0.57 [95% CI, 0.01?1.14] ?10?6mm2/s/month).</p-->CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in Fabry disease, changes in diffusion precede the formation of white matter lesions and that microstructural changes progress faster in men compared with women. These findings suggest that DWI may be of predictive value for white matter lesion formation in Fabry disease.

N2  -  The binding of three tracers for monoaminergic terminals was mapped in the brain of healthy young (N = 6) and healthy old rhesus monkeys (N = 4), aged monkeys with mild unilateral intracarotid MPTP lesions (N = 3), and monkeys of intermediate age with severe systemic MPTP lesions (N = 6). The ligand for monoaminergic vesicles (+)-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine (+DTBZ) had a mean binding potential (pB) of 1.4 in striatum of the healthy young monkeys, which was reduced by 20% in putamen of the old monkeys. The catecholamine transporter ligand (+)[C-11]methylphenidate (+MP) had a mean pB of 1.3 in striatum of the young monkeys, which was reduced by 40% in caudate and putamen of the old monkeys. The DOPA decarboxylase substrate [F-18]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) had a mean decarboxylation coefficient (k(3)(s)) of 0.4 h(-1) in striatum of the young group, and was not significantly reduced in the aged group. Of the three ligands, only +DTBZ pB was significantly reduced in striatum of the small group of animals with mild unilateral lesions. In the group with systemic MPTP lesions, the mean reduction of the binding of the three ligands was 80% in the caudate and putamen. However, the decline in +MP pB in the ventral striatum (-75%) exceeded the declines of +DTBZ pB and FDOPA ks in that region (-65%), suggesting that compensatory down-modulation of uptake sites may occur in the striatal regions with the least dopamine depletion. Binding of all three ligands was reduced by 50% in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the thalamus, suggesting toxicity of MPTP for extrastriatal catecholamine innervations. +DTBZ binding in the hypothalamus, presumably mainly in serotonin fibers, was unaffected by systemic MPTP treatment. Of the three tracers, +DTBZ was most sensitive for detecting MPTP-induced dopamine depletion in monkey striatum. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  We report a patient with a cavernous malformation involving the right lentiform nucleus. Pre-surgical planning included fMRI localization of language, motor, and sensory processing, and DTI of white matter tracts. fMRI results revealed no activation near the planned resection zone. However, post-surgery the patient developed a subdural fluid collection, which applied pressure to the primary motor cortex (M1). Follow-up scans revealed that motor activation had shifted due to pressure, and then shifted to a new location after the fluid collection subsided. This case report suggests that long-term neural reorganization can occur in response to short term compression in the cortex.

N2  -  The specific binding of I-125-Tyr11-somatostatin-14 (I-125-Tyr11-SS-14) was measured in different cortical regions after unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the rat nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). A marked loss of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers was observed in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices ipsilateral to the lesion. The loss of cholinergic cell bodies in the NBM was further investigated with cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry which indeed demonstrated a loss of ChAT-positive magnocellular perikarya. Autoradiographic analyses of specific binding of I-125-Tyr11-SS-14 demonstrated a significant reduction in binding density in the denervated parts of the neocortex. The decrease in specific binding was most pronounced (40-50%) in the superficial layers (I-III) of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices 2 and 4 weeks after lesion. A significant loss in I-125-Tyr11-SS-14 binding in the deeper layers was only observed in the frontal cortex after 2 and 4 weeks. In the occipital cortex a significant decrease was measured in the superficial layers only after 4 weeks. The specific binding in all cortical regions returned to normal after 6 weeks. The results suggested that I-125-Tyr11-SS-14 binding sites are localized on cholinergic afferents in the rat neocortex and that an up-regulation of number of binding sites, alternatively an increased binding affinity occured with time after lesion.

N2  -  Background. Neurological and oncological outcomes of motor eloquent brain-tumor patients depend upon the ability to localize functional areas and the respective proposed therapy. We set out to determine whether the use of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) had an impact on treatment and outcome in patients with brain tumors in motor eloquent locations.
Methods. We enrolled 250 consecutive patients and compared their functional and oncological outcomes to a matched pre-nTMS control group (n = 115).; Results. nTMS mapping results disproved suspected involvement of primary motor cortex in 25.1% of cases, expanded surgical indication in 14.8%, and led to planning of more extensive resection in 35.2% of cases and more restrictive resection in 3.5%. In comparison with the control group, the rate of gross total resections increased significantly from 42% to 59% (P<. 05). Progression-free-survival for low grade glioma was significantly better in the nTMS group at 22.4 months than in control group at 15.4 months (P<.05). Integration of nTMS led to a nonsignificant change of postoperative deficits from 8.5% in the control group to 6.1% in the nTMS group.; Conclusions. nTMS provides crucial data for preoperative planning and surgical resection of tumors involving essential motor areas. Expanding surgical indications and extent of resection based on nTMS enables more patients to undergo surgery and might lead to better neurological outcomes and higher survival rates in brain tumor patients. The impact of this study should go far beyond the neurosurgical community because it could fundamentally improve treatment and outcome, and its results will likely change clinical practice.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Preoperative diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) has recently been used to aid in the mapping of functional pathways to limit damage associated with resection of low-grade gliomas (LGGs).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive capacity of DTT as a biomarker of postoperative motor outcomes in patients with LGGs involving the corticospinal tract (CST). CST parameters obtained using a quantitative fiber tracking approach were used to investigate the reliability of the DTT biomarker by comparing their values in the tumoral (Tcst) and healthy (Hcst) hemispheres.; METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with LGGs involving the CST were enrolled. Quantification of structural differences between the Tcst and Hcst were analyzed according to the novel biomarker (NF index), defined as follows: (Hcst NF - Tcst NF)Hcst NF, where NF represents the number of fibers in each region. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations among clinical postoperative outcomes and NF index values, tumoral patterns, and premotor motor evoked potentials.; RESULTS: NF values significantly differed between the Tcst and Hcst. Analysis of the NF index showed that patients with a preoperative NF index < 0.22 had a significantly lower risk of developing transient postoperative deficits (area under the curve, 0.92; 95% binomial confidence interval, 0.834-1). Patients with less pronounced differences in NF between the Tcst and Hcst also experienced better clinical outcomes.; CONCLUSIONS: The NF index may be a useful biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with LGGs. Furthermore, the NF index may provide a preoperative estimate of the patient's potential for recovery from possible postsurgical neurologic deficits.

N2  -  Recent data suggest a potential role of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) electrical stimulation in improving gait and posture in Parkinson's disease. Because the PPN receives fibres from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we investigated the effects of STN-high-frequency stimulation (HFS) on PPN neuronal activity in intact rats and in rats bearing either an ibotenate lesion of the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) or a lesion of the substantia nigra (SN). The main response of PPN neurons to STN single-shock stimulations in the three experimental groups was a short latency (4.5 +/- 2.1 ms) and brief (15.3 +/- 6.5 ms) excitation. This response was maintained during 1-5 s of STN-HFS (130 Hz, 60 mu s, 100-1000 mu A). In EP-lesioned rats the percentage (75.0%) of PPN neurons showing a modulation of activity following STN-HFS was significantly higher compared with that observed in intact (39.7%) and in SN-lesioned rats (35.4%). Furthermore, in EP-lesioned rats the most frequent response of PPN neurons following STN-HFS was a 5-20 s excitation, which was present in 76.6% of responsive neurons in comparison to 15.4% and 9.1% of neurons responsive in intact and in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, respectively. Neurons responsive to STN-HFS in the three experimental groups showed either a sharp positively skewed distribution of interspike intervals or multisecond oscillations in autocorrelograms. The results support that STN-HFS modulates the PPN through a balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences, which may be independent from the dopaminergic nigral neurons. In the absence of inhibitory EP fibres, the direct excitatory influence exerted by the STN on the PPN appears to predominate.

N2  -  Purpose The magnetization transfer and relaxation normalized amide proton transfer (MRAPT) analysis is promising to provide a highly pH-specific mapping of tissue acidosis, complementing commonly used CEST asymmetry analysis. We aimed to develop a fast B-0 inhomogeneity correction algorithm for acute stroke magnetization transfer and relaxation normalized amide proton transfer imaging without Z-spectral interpolation. Methods The proposed fast field inhomogeneity correction describes B-0 artifacts with linear regression. We compared the new algorithm with the routine interpolation correction approach in CEST imaging of a dual-pH phantom. The fast B-0 correction was further evaluated in amide proton transfer imaging of normal and acute stroke rats. Results Our phantom data showed that the proposed fast B-0 inhomogeneity correction significantly improved pH MRI contrast, recovering over 80% of the pH MRI contrast-to-noise-ratio difference between the raw magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry and that using the routine interpolation-based B-0 correction approach. In normal rat brains, the proposed fast B-0 correction improved pH-specific MRI uniformity across the intact tissue, with the ratio of magnetization transfer and relaxation normalized amide proton transfer ratio being 10% of that without B-0 inhomogeneity correction. In acute stroke rats, fast B-0 inhomogeneity-corrected pH MRI reveals substantially improved pH lesion conspicuity, particularly in regions with nonnegligible B-0 inhomogeneity. The pH MRI contrast-to-noise ratio between the ipsilateral diffusion lesion and contralateral normal tissue improved significantly with fast B-0 correction (from 1.88 +/- 0.48 to 2.20 +/- 0.44, P < .01). Conclusions Our study established an expedient B-0 inhomogeneity correction algorithm for fast pH imaging of acute ischemia.

N2  -  Objective
Several studies have analyzed a correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted MRI and the tumor cellularity of corresponding histopathological specimens in brain tumors with inconclusive findings. Here, we compared a large dataset of ADC and cellularity values of stereotactic biopsies of glioblastoma patients using a new postprocessing approach including trajectory analysis and automatic nuclei counting.; Materials and Methods; Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were enrolled in this study. ADC maps were acquired preoperatively at 3T and coregistered to the intraoperative MRI that contained the coordinates of the biopsy trajectory. 561 biopsy specimens were obtained; corresponding cellularity was calculated by semi-automatic nuclei counting and correlated to the respective preoperative ADC values along the stereotactic biopsy trajectory which included areas of T1-contrast-enhancement and necrosis.; Results; There was a weak to moderate inverse correlation between ADC and cellularity in glioblastomas that varied depending on the approach towards statistical analysis: for mean values per patient, Spearman's rho = -0.48 (p = 0.002), for all trajectory values in one joint analysis Spearman's rho = -0.32 (p < 0.001). The inverse correlation was additionally verified by a linear mixed model.; Conclusions; Our data confirms a previously reported inverse correlation between ADC and tumor cellularity. However, the correlation in the current article is weaker than the pooled correlation of comparable previous studies. Hence, besides cell density, other factors, such as necrosis and edema might influence ADC values in glioblastomas.

N2  -  Background and Objectives Diffusion-restricted (DR) lesions of the splenium are encountered in a wide variety of pathologies, and their significance is often unclear. We sought to report the spectrum of clinical presentations, neuroimaging patterns, and the predictors of radiographic and clinical outcomes from DR splenial lesions.Methods This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2020. A consecutive sample of 3,490 individuals who underwent brain MRI with reported corpus callosum lesions during the study period were evaluated for DR lesions in the corpus callosum. DR lesions were defined as increased signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging sequences with decreased signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient. Patients with prior neurosurgical procedures, hemorrhage-associated DR, anoxic brain injury, and chronic or previously known or characterized disease processes in the corpus callosum were excluded. Clinical and radiologic outcomes were ascertained, including readmissions within 1 year, in-hospital mortality rates, and resolution of DR at first follow-up imaging. Outcomes were defined a priori.Results Two hundred patients met criteria for inclusion. The average age was 57 years (standard deviation 19 years). Near half of the patients were women (47%). Encephalopathy (55%), focal weakness (46.5%), and cortical signs (44%) were the most common presenting clinical features. Thirty-five cases (17.5%) had features consistent with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs). Vascular causes were most frequent (61%), followed by malignancy-related (15%) and trauma (8%). In-hospital mortality occurred in 8.5% of cases, 46.5% were readmitted to the hospital within 1 year, and 49.1% of patients had resolution of the splenial DR at the next scan. Backward stepwise regression models showed that mass effect was negatively associated with splenial DR resolution (odds ratio [OR]: 0.12, confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.46, p = 0.002). Encephalopathy was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 4.50, CI 1.48-17.95, p = 0.007). Patients with a CLOCC had less frequent readmissions at 1-year compared with patients without a CLOCC, p = 0.015.Discussion Vascular DR lesions of the splenium were more common than CLOCCs and other etiologies in this cohort. While splenial DR lesions can present a clinical challenge, their associated clinical and radiographic characteristics may predict outcome and guide prognosis.

N2  -  Analysis of records from the scalp in healthy subjects and from scalp and cortex in a patient without somatosensory abnormality suggest that 2 groups of large afferent fibers are responsible for the response evoked by shocks to nerves in the upper extremity. The overall conduction time from wrist to cortex differed in these 2 systems by about 8 msec. Each gave rise to a brief negative potential, attributed to presynaptic potentials in projection fibers, followed by a brief positive potential, attributed to postsynaptic potentials in cortical neurones. From its distribution, the 1st positive potential (peak 23 msec.) is considered to be the positive wave of the primary response in S1. The 2nd peak, 30 msec., is largest posterior and lateral to the first and may be a 2nd potential peak within S1, or, less probably a response in S2. Both early positive potentials were recorded from the scalp in 7 of the 25 subjects; in the remainder, scalp electrodes recorded one or other or a summation of the 2. The early positive potentials were followed by late negative waves and a still later positive wave. The latter (peak 40-60 msec.) was attributed to association areas and was sometimes evoked by shocks at sensory threshold just too weak to evoke the earlier potentials. Concurrent tactile or kinaesthetic stimuli reduced the response evoked by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve (masking); this block appeared to be in part subcortical. When long trains of stimuli were given, the amplitude of the cerebral response and particularly of the late negative wave decreased with time. An even greater decrease in amplitude occurred during sleep. In peripheral neuropathy, the majority of large afferent fibers showed increased thresholds to electrical stimulation and decreased conduction velocities. Evoked responses were abnormal even when sensory discrimination was not impaired. Abnormality of evoked responses in patients with lesions of the spinal cord correlated best with impaired joint position sense. Evoked potentials were normal even when the thermoanaesthesia was severe. The usual afferent pathway in the spinal cord appeared to be ipsilateral but a slower pathway, possibly crossed, was also revealed. In 42 patients with cerebral lesions, evoked responses correlated with results of sensory examination in 34 but showed discrepancies in eight. Possibly, sensory function had transferred to the intact hemisphere in a patient with no demonstrable sersory loss and virtual absence of evoked responses from the damaged hemisphere. In contrast, 7 patients (in whom evoked potentials were normal) showed sensory loss due to lesions which spared the primary receiving area. The latter patients showed, in various degrees, elevation of the sensory threshold to electrical stimulation and "inattention" in limbs contralateral to the lesion and, associated with this, a dissociation between the sensory threshold and threshold for evoked potentials - i. e. , large responses were recorded with shocks the patients apparently could not perceive.

N2  -  Purpose: We assessed whether a high b-value DWI at b = 4000 s/mm(2) would discriminate the histopathological differentiation of the tumor grade of meningiomas, and also focused on the relationship between radiologic features and the tumor grade.
Materials and methods: We acquired DWI at 3T with b = 1000 and b = 4000 smm2 in 77 patients (42, 31 and 4 patients were WHO grades I (G1), II (G2), and III (G3), respectively). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured by placing multiple regions of interest (ROIs) on ADC maps. The ADC values of each tumor were determined preoperatively from several ROIs, and expressed as the minimum (ADC(MIN)), mean (ADC(MEAN)), and maximum absolute values (ADC(MAX)). We evaluated the relationship between ADCs and histological findings, and assessed the radiologic features such as tumor location, tumor size, presenceabsence of peritumoral edema, shape of the tumor, presenceabsence of bone destruction or hyperplasia, status of contrast enhancement, presenceabsence of calcification and cyst.; Results: ADCs of the meningiomas were inversely correlated with the histological grade of meningiomas. According to results of the discriminant analysis, the apparent log likelihood value was greatest for ADC(MIN) at b = 4000. Furthermore, only the ADC(MIN) value at b = 4000 was significantly correlated with the histological grade of meningiomas when we performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the significant independent factors such as shape of tumor, presenceabsence of bone destruction, status of contrast enhancement, presenceabsence of cyst and ADC(MIN) at b = 4000.; Conclusion: A meningioma with a low ADC(MIN) at a high b-value might imply a high-grade meningioma.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased glycine concentration in the brain is associated with altered metabolism in cancer and can be detected by using in vivo MR spectroscopy. This has been proposed as a marker for grade IV gliomas; however, little is known about the potential significance and frequency of in vivo glycine observation. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate of occurrence and spatial distribution of glycine observation with respect to other MR imaging parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from volumetric whole-brain MR spectroscopic imaging of 59 subjects with glioma were analyzed with glycine included in the spectral model. The associations of the signal amplitude and spatial distributions of glycine with findings from contrast-enhanced T1, perfusion, and diffusion MR imaging were then examined.; RESULTS: Glycine was detected in 24% of all studies, though with a wide range of signal amplitude and extent of the spatial distributions. While more commonly seen in grade IV tumors (42% of studies), relatively large concentrations were also detected in grade II and III gliomas. Coanalysis with other metabolites indicated a strong association with choline and that glycine was frequently seen to be overlapping with, and adjacent to, areas of high lactate concentration. Increased glycine was always associated with contrast enhancement and areas of increased cerebral blood flow, but without any clear association with other image parameters.; CONCLUSIONS: Detection of increased glycine in gliomas appears to identify a subgroup of tumors and areas of increased proliferation.

N2  -  Objectives: To determine whether high-frequency 250-500 Hz monopolar stimulation is effective for mapping cortical and subcortical language structures during brain tumor resection.
Methods: Using high-frequency monopolar stimulation, we mapped the speech areas of 41 awake patients undergoing brain tumor resection in the dominant hemisphere, subject to risk of lesions in the cortical and subcortical speech tracts. Patients were tested for object naming, semantic and other language tasks.; Results: Mapping was positive in 22 out of 41 patients. Nine patients presented clinical worsening immediately after surgery. Only one patient did not recover after the 30-day follow-up. Nineteen patients showed negative mapping for language tracts, none of whom exhibited worsening of symptoms at the final evaluation. The applied method showed 89% sensitivity and 56% specificity rates.; Conclusions: The applied method was effective in identifying cortical and subcortical speech areas during the surgical resection of brain tumors.; Significance: Determining whether monopolar high-frequency stimulation is effective for language mapping is important, since it may be very effective in infiltrating tumor areas and nearby edema region.

N2  -  Background: Maximum safe resection of infiltrative brain tumors in eloquent area is the primary objective in surgical neuro-oncology. This goal can be achieved with direct electrical stimulation (DES) to perform a functional mapping of the brain in patients awake intraoperatively. When awake surgery is not possible, we propose a pipeline procedure that combines advanced techniques aiming at performing a dissection that respects the anatomo-functional connectivity of the peritumoral region. This procedure can benefit from intraoperative monitoring with computerized tomography scan (iCT-scan) and brain shift correction. Associated with this intraoperative monitoring, the additional value of preoperative investigation combining brain mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) with various neuroimaging modalities (tractography and resting state functional MRI) has not yet been reported.
Case Report: A 42-year-old left-handed man had increased intracranial pressure (IICP), left hand muscle deficit, and dysarthria, related to an infiltrative tumor of the right frontal lobe with large mass effect and circumscribed contrast enhancement in motor and premotor cortical areas. Spectroscopy profile and intratumoral calcifications on CT-scan suggested an WHO grade III glioma, later confirmed by histology. The aforementioned surgical procedure was considered, since standard awake surgery was not appropriate for this patient. In preoperative time, nTMS mapping of motor function (deltoid, first interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles) was performed, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography reconstruction of 6 neural tracts (arcuate, corticospinal, inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and resting-state functional MRI connectivity (rs-fMRI) of sensorimotor and language networks. In intraoperative time, DES mapping was performed with motor evoked response recording and tumor resection was optimized using non-rigid image transformation of the preoperative data (nTMS, tractography, and rs-fMRI) to iCT data. Image guidance was updated with correction for brain shift and tissue deformation using biomechanical modeling taking into account brain elastic properties. This correction was done at crucial surgical steps, i.e., when tumor bulged through the craniotomy after dura mater opening and when approaching the presumed eloquent brain regions. This procedure allowed a total resection of the tumor region with contrast enhancement as well as a complete regression of IICP and dysarthria. Hand paresis remained stable with no additional deficit. Postoperative nTMS mapping confirmed the good functional outcome.; Conclusion: This case report and technical note highlights the value of preoperative functional evaluation by nTMS updated intraoperatively with correction of brain deformation by iCT. This multimodal approach may become the optimized technique of reference for patients with brain tumors in eloquent areas that are unsuitable for awake brain surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging tractography provides 3-dimensional reconstruction of principal white matter tracts, but its spatial accuracy has been questioned. Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) enables somatotopic mapping of the motor cortex.
OBJECTIVE: We used motor maps to reconstruct the corticospinal tract (CST) by integrating elements of its somatotopic organization. We analyzed the accuracy of this method compared with a standard technique and verified its reliability with intraoperative subcortical stimulation.; METHODS: We prospectively collected data from patients who underwent surgery between January 2012 and October 2013 for lesions involving the CST. nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging tractography was compared with a standard technique. The reliability and accuracy between the 2 techniques were analyzed by comparing the number of fibers, the concordance in size, and the location of the cortical end of the CST and the motor area. The accuracy of the technique was assessed by using direct subcortical stimulation.; RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. nTMS-based tractography provided a detailed somatotopic reconstruction of the CST. This nTMS-based reconstruction resulted in a decreased number of fibers (305.1 +- 231.7 vs 1024 +- 193, P < .001) and a significantly greater overlap between the motor cortex and the cortical end-region of the CST compared with the standard technique (90.5 +- 8.8% vs 58.3 +- 16.6%, P < .001). Direct subcortical stimulation confirmed the CST location and the somatotopic reconstruction in all cases.; CONCLUSION: These results suggest that nTMS-based tractography of the CST is more accurate and less operator dependent than the standard technique and provides a reliable anatomic and functional characterization of the motor pathway.

N2  -  Background. Previously, we demonstrated the high accuracy of alpha-[C-11] methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) PET for differentiating recurrent gliomas from radiation injury. The present study evaluated the prognostic value of increased AMT uptake in patients with previously treated high-grade glioma.
Methods. AMT-PET was performed in 39 patients with suspected recurrence of World Health Organization grades III-IV glioma following surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) and unidirectional AMT uptake (K) were measured in brain regions suspicious for tumor and compared with the contralateral cortex (ie, background). Optimal cutoff thresholds for 1-year survival prediction were determined for each AMT parameter and used for calculating the prognostic value of high (above threshold) versus low (below threshold) values for post-PET overall survival (OS).; Results. In univariate analyses, 1-year survival was strongly associated with 3 AMT parameters (SUVmax, SUVmean, and tumor-to-background K-ratio; odds ratios: 21.3-25.6; P <=. 001) and with recent change in MRI contrast enhancement (odds ratio: 14.7; P =.02). Median OS was 876 days in the low-versus 177 days in the high-AMT groups (log-rank P<.001). In multivariate analyses, all 3 AMT parameters remained strong predictors of survival: high AMT values were associated with unfavorable 1-year survival (binary regression P <=. 003) and shorter overall survival in the whole group (Cox regression hazard ratios: 5.3-10.0) and in patients with recent enhancement change on MRI as well (hazard ratios: 7.0-9.3; P <=. 001).; Conclusion. Increased AMT uptake on PET is highly prognostic for 1-year and overall survival, independent of MRI contrast enhancement and other prognostic factors in patients with a previously treated high-grade glioma.

N2  -  To clarify the morphological characteristics of exofocal post-ischemic neuronal death (EPND) in the substantia nigra (SN), we investigated the course of light- and electron-microscopic changes of the SN of rats subjected to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 1, 2, 4, 7 and 12 days. To assess cellular edema, sequential magnetic resonance (MR) mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the T-2 value test was performed. Histological and electron-microscopic examination on day 1 showed dotted chromatin clumps in the nuclei of some neurons and mild swelling of the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes in the ipsilateral SN. On day 2, a few cells of the ipsilateral SN pars reticulata (SNr) revealed key morphological signs of apoptosis - apoptotic body-like condensation and segregation of the chromatin and DNA fragmentation-like nuclear remnants. On day 4, 38% of neurons became swollen (pale neurons) with cytoplasmic microvacuoles, which appeared to originate from rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), mitochondria and Golgi apparatus. Twenty percent of neurons showed massive proliferation of the cisternae of the rER, some of which were fragmented or had lost their normal parallel arrangement. In addition, MR mapping revealed a transient ADC decrease with a T-2 increase (signifying a phase of cellular edema), which coordinated with the phase of ultrastructural cellular swelling. Further, the total number of neurons started to decrease gradually, the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes were markedly swollen, and the neuropil became loose on day 4. On day 7, reactive astrocytes and dark neurons occurred most frequently. These results suggest that the EPND in the SN after occlusion of the MCA in adult rats is due to both apoptosis and necrosis, although necrosis seems to be the dominant mechanism of the EPND. However, the morphologic resemblances of EPND to delayed neuronal death suggest these processes have a common pathomechanism.

N2  -  In addition to the seminal lesion studies of aphasiology, the development of functional neuroimaging has allowed a better understanding of the neural foundations of language. However, despite a substantial improvement in the knowledge of the cortical networks organization, the underlying subcortical association circuits have received less attention. Recent advances in fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging, combined with personal studies using intraoperative electrostimulation, which temporarily inactivates restricted regions during brain surgery, have enabled to map language pathways in humans with spatiotemporal resolution unmatched by other techniques. On the basis of these new insights, my purpose is to revisit the anatomo-functional connectivity of language. First, I discuss the role of the white bundles thought to be essential for language, with special emphasis regarding the structure-function relationships pertaining to the distinct subcomponents of language. Second, I propose an integrative view of connectivity, that considers language as the final product of the well-synchronized functioning of parallel distributed cortico-subcortical networks.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate MRI myelin water imaging (MWI) by multicomponent T-2 relaxometry as a quantitative imaging biomarker for brain radiation-induced changes and to compare it with DTI.
Methods: Sixteen patients underwent fractionated proton therapy (PT) receiving dose to the healthy tissue because of direct or indirect (base skull tumors) irradiation. MWI was performed by a multi-echo sequence with 32 equally spaced echoes (10-320 ms). Decay data were processed to identify 3 T-2 compartments: myelin water (Mw) below 40 ms, intra-extracellular water (IEw) between 40 and 250 ms, and free water (CSFw) above 250 ms. Both MWI and DTI scans were acquired pre (pre)-treatment and immediately at the end (end) of PT. After image registration, voxel-wise difference maps, obtained by subtracting MWI and DTI pre from those acquired at the end of PT, were compared with the corresponding biological equivalent dose (BED).; Results: Mw difference showed a positive correlation and IEw difference showed a negative correlation with BED considering end-pre changes (P <.01). The changes in CSFw were not significantly correlated with the delivered BED. The changes in DTI data, considering end-pre acquisitions, showed a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy and the delivered BED.; Conclusion: MWI might detect early white matter radiation-induced alterations, providing additional information to DTI, which might improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of the radiation damage.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Affective symptoms are frequent in patients with brain tumors. The origin of such symptoms is unknown; either focal brain injury or reactive emotional distress may be responsible. This cross-sectional pilot study linked depressive symptoms and anxiety to white matter integrity. The objective was to test the hypothesis of a relationship between tissue damage and brain function in patients with brain tumors and to provide a basis for further studies in this field.
METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed in 39 patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary brain tumor. Patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory, and examiners rated them on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). State and trait anxiety were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA) and psychological measures were assessed on the basis of regions of interest; the defined regions of interest corresponded to clearly specified white matter tracts.; RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed correlations between FA in the left internal capsule and scores on the HDRS, Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (P < 0.05). HDRS scores were also correlated with FA in the right medial uncinate fasciculus, and state anxiety scores were significantly correlated with FA in the left lateral and medial uncinate fasciculus (P < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that neurobiologic mechanisms related to the integrity of tissue in specific white matter tracts may influence affective symptoms in patients with brain tumors, and these mechanisms can be investigated with diffusion tensor imaging. However, prospective observational studies are needed to investigate further the links between brain structures and the severity of affective symptoms in this patient population.

N2  -  Typically, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) involves the parieto-occipital lobes. When regions of the brain other than the parieto-occipital lobes are predominantly involved, the syndrome can be called atypical RPLS. The purpose of this study is to find radiological and pathophysiological features of atypical RPLS by using diffusion-weighted imaging (D-WI). We retrospectively reviewed seven patients (two with eclampsia, one with cyclosporine neurotoxicity, and four with hypertensive encephalopathy) with atypical MR manifestations of RPLS. Changes in signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI) and D-WI, and ADC ratio, were analyzed. In patients with atypical manifestation of RPLS, high signal intensities on T2-WI were noted in the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and subcortical white matter in regions other than the parieto-occipital lobes. These areas of increased signal intensities on T2-WI showed increased ADC values, representing vasogenic edema in all seven patients. This result should be very useful in differentiating atypical RPLS from other metabolic brain disorders that affect the same sites with cytotoxic edema.

N2  -  Recent publications had reported high rates of preoperative neurological impairments in WHO grade II gliomas (GIIG) that significantly affect the quality of life. Consequently, one step further in the analysis of surgical outcome in GIIG is to evaluate if surgery is capable to improve preoperative deficits. Here are reported two cases of GIIG infiltrating the primary motor cortex and pyramidal pathway that had a long-term paresis before surgery. Both patients were operated with intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping, with identification and preservation of the primary motor cortex and pyramidal tract. Despite the long-lasting paresis, both cases had a significant improvement of motor function after surgery. Knowledge of this potential recovery before surgery is of major significance for planning the surgical strategy in GIIG. Two possible predictors of motor recovery were analyzed: 1) reconstruction of the corticospinal tract with diffusion tensor imaging tractography is indicative of anatomo-functional integrity, despite tract deviation and infiltration; 2) intraoperative identification of motor response by electrostimulation confirms the presence of an intact peritumoral tract. Thus, resection should stop at this boundary even in cases of long lasting preoperative hemiplegia.

N2  -  Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of primary adult brain tumour. The median survival of patients with glioblastoma remains approximately 15 months, and the 5-year survival rate is <10%. Current treatment options are limited, and the standard of care has remained relatively constant since 2011. Over the last decade, a range of different treatment regimens have been investigated with very limited success. Tumour recurrence is almost inevitable with the current treatment strategies, as glioblastoma tumours are highly heterogeneous and invasive. Additionally, another challenging issue facing patients with glioblastoma is how to distinguish between tumour progression and treatment effects, especially when relying on routine diagnostic imaging techniques in the clinic. The specificity of routine imaging for identifying tumour progression early or in a timely manner is poor due to the appearance similarity of post-treatment effects. Here, we concisely describe the current status and challenges in the assessment and early prediction of therapy response and the early detection of tumour progression or recurrence. We also summarize and discuss studies of advanced approaches such as quantitative imaging, liquid biomarker discovery and machine intelligence that hold exceptional potential to aid in the therapy monitoring of this malignancy and early prediction of therapy response, which may decisively transform the conventional detection methods in the era of precision medicine.
Qi et al. review current challenges in the assessment of therapy response in patients with glioblastoma. They discuss the use of quantitative imaging, liquid biomarkers and machine intelligence for the early prediction of therapy response and tumour progression to guide clinical decision making.

N2  -  The aim of investigation was to assess treatment outcomes in adult patients with thalamic tumors, operated on with the aid of tractography (DTI) and monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) generated due to transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the subcortical white matter.
38 subsequent patients with thalamic tumors were operated on using tractography (DTI)-integrated neuronavigation, transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and direct electrical stimulation (DES). The volumetric method was used to calculate pre- and postoperative tumor volume.; Total tumor resection (100%) was performed in 18 (47%) patients, subtotal in 9 (24%) (mean extent of resection -89.4%) and partial in 11 (29%) patients (mean extent of resection -77.18%). The mean extent of resection for all surgical patients was 86.5%.; Two (5.2%) patients died postoperatively. Preoperative hemiparesis was present in 18 (47%) patients. Postoperative hemiparesis was observed in 11 (29%) patients of whom only in 5 (13%) new paresis was noted due to surgical intervention. In patients with hemiparesis significantly more frequently larger tumor volume was detected preoperatively. Low mean normal fractional anisotropy (nFA) values in the internal capsule were observed statistically significantly more frequently in patients with preoperative hemiparesis as compared to the internal capsule of the unaffected hemisphere. Transcranial electrical stimulation helps to predict postoperative paresis of extremities. Direct electrical stimulation is an effective tool for intraoperative localization of the internal capsule thus helping to avoid postoperative deficit.; In patients with tumor grade I and II the median time to tumor progression was 36 months. In the case of patients with grades III and IV it was 14 months. The median survival time in patients with grades land II it was 60 months. In patients with grades III and IV it was 18 months. Basing on our results, patients with glioma grade III according to WHO classification are the best candidates for surgical treatment of thalamic tumors. In this group of the patients more often resection is radical, median time to progression and survival time are longer than in patients with gliomas grade III and IV. Within a 7-year follow-up none of the patients with GIGII grade glioma died. (C) 2018 Polish Neurological Society. Published by Elsevier Sp. z o.o. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Objective: Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a measure for the degree of microstructural organization. Several studies have used FA values to assess microstructural organization of brain tumors and peritumoral edema. The purpose of our study was to validate FA and apparent diffusion constant (ADC) values in the diagnosis of meningiomas versus high-grade glial tumors, with the focus on the ability of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to reveal tumor ultrastructure. Our hypothesis was that FA and ADC values significantly differ between high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, and in the peritumoral edema.
Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging values were obtained from 20 patients with meningiomas (21 tumors) and 15 patients with high-grade gliomas. Regions of interest were outlined in FA and ADC maps for solid-enhancing tumor tissue and peritumoral edema. Fractional anisotropy and ADC values were normalized by comparison to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in the contralateral hemisphere. Differences between meningiomas and high-grade gliomas were statistically analyzed.; Results: Meningiomas showed a significantly higher FA tumorFA NAWM ratio (P = 0.0001) and lower ADC tumorADC NAWM ratio (P = 0.0008) compared to high-grade gliomas. On average, meningiomas also showed higher FA values in peritumoral edema than high-grade gliomas (P = 0.016). Apparent diffusion constant values of peritumoral edema for the 2 tumor groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.5).; Conclusions: Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to reveal microstructural differences between meningiomas and high-grade gliomas and may contribute toward predicting the histopathology of intracranial tumors. We advocate that diffusion tensor imaging should be included in the standard imaging protocol for patients with intracranial tumors.

T2  -  STROKE

N2  -  Background and Purpose-Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is often due to vestibular neuritis but can result from vertebrobasilar strokes. Misdiagnosis of posterior fossa infarcts in emergency care settings is frequent. Bedside oculomotor findings may reliably identify stroke in AVS, but prospective studies have been lacking.
Methods-The authors conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study at an academic hospital. Consecutive patients with AVS (vertigo, nystagmus, nauseavomiting, head-motion intolerance, unsteady gait) with >= 1 stroke risk factor underwent structured examination, including horizontal head impulse test of vestibulo-ocular reflex function, observation of nystagmus in different gaze positions, and prism cross-cover test of ocular alignment. All underwent neuroimaging and admission (generally <72 hours after symptom onset). Strokes were diagnosed by MRI or CT. Peripheral lesions were diagnosed by normal MRI and clinical follow-up.; Results-One hundred one high-risk patients with AVS included 25 peripheral and 76 central lesions (69 ischemic strokes, 4 hemorrhages, 3 other). The presence of normal horizontal head impulse test, direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze, or skew deviation (vertical ocular misalignment) was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for stroke. Skew was present in 17% and associated with brainstem lesions (4% peripheral, 4% pure cerebellar, 30% brainstem involvement; chi(2), P=0.003). Skew correctly predicted lateral pontine stroke in 2 of 3 cases in which an abnormal horizontal head impulse test erroneously suggested peripheral localization. Initial MRI diffusion-weighted imaging was falsely negative in 12% (all <48 hours after symptom onset).; Conclusions-Skew predicts brainstem involvement in AVS and can identify stroke when an abnormal horizontal head impulse test falsely suggests a peripheral lesion. A 3-step bedside oculomotor examination ( HINTS: Head-Impulse-Nystagmus-Test-of-Skew) appears more sensitive for stroke than early MRI in AVS. (Stroke. 2009; 40: 3504-3510.)

N2  -  Background: Objective: To identify and examine neural reorganization of the sensory network in terms of lesion type, somatotopic organization of the primary somatosensory area, and functional connectivity in relation to sensory function in children and young adults with cerebral palsy (CP).Methods: Design: systematic review, Prospero registration ID 342570. Data sources: PubMed; Cochrane; Web of Science; Embase; CINAHL and PEDro from inception to March 13, 2021. Eligibility criteria: All types of original studies, concerning sensory connectivity in relation to sensory outcome in patients with spastic CP, <30 years of age. No publication status or date restrictions were applied. Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently determined the eligibility of studies. Quality assessment was performed by a third author. Neuro-imaging/neurophysiological techniques, sensory outcomes and patient characteristics were extracted.Results: Children and young adults with periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) lesions have significantly better hand function and sensation scores than patients with cortical-subcortical/middle cerebral artery (MCA) lesions. Ipsilesional reorganization of the S1 (primary somatosensory cortex) area appears to be the primary compensation mechanism after a unilateral early brain lesion, regardless of the timing of the lesion. Interhemispheric reorganization of the sensory system after early brain lesions is rare and, when it occurs, poorly effective. Diffusion tractography shows a positive correlation between the ascending sensory tract (AST) diffusivity metrics of the more affected hemisphere and sensory test outcomes.Discussion and conclusions: Because of the large variability in study design, patient characteristics, neuroimaging/neurophysiological techniques and parameters as well as sensory assessment methods used, it is difficult to draw definite inferences on the relationship between the reorganization of the sensory network following early brain damage and sensory function in children and young adults with CP. In general, sensory function seems to be worse in cortical as opposed to white matter tract (PVL) lesions. International consensus on a clinically relevant sensory test battery is needed to enhance understanding of the intriguing compensatory mechanisms of sensory network following early brain damage and potential consequences for rehabilitation strategies.

N2  -  Objectives: To investigate the relationship between imaging features derived from lesion loads and 3 month clinical assessments in ischemic stroke patients. To support clinically implementable predictive modeling with information from lesion-load features.
Methods: A retrospective cohort of ischemic stroke patients was studied. The dataset was dichotomized based on revascularization treatment outcome (TICI score). Three lesion delineations were derived from magnetic resonance imaging in each group: two clinically implementable (threshold based and fully automatic prediction) and 90-day follow-up as final groundtruth. Lesion load imaging features were created through overlay of the lesion delineations on a histological brain atlas, and were correlated with the clinical assessment (NIHSS). Significance of the correlations was assessed by constructing confidence intervals using bootstrap sampling.; Results: Overall, high correlations between lesion loads and clinical score were observed (up to 0.859). Delineations derived from acute imaging yielded on average somewhat lower correlations than delineations derived from 90-day follow-up imaging. Correlations suggest that both total lesion volume and corticospinal tract lesion load are associated with functional outcome, and in addition highlight other potential areas associated with poor clinical outcome, including the primary somatosensory cortex BA3a. Fully automatic prediction was comparable to ADC threshold-based delineation on the successfully treated cohort and superior to the Tmax threshold-based delineation in the unsuccessfully treated cohort.; Conclusions: The confirmation of established predictors for stroke outcome (e.g., corticospinal tract integrity and total lesion volume) gives support to the proposed methodology-relating acute lesion loads to 3 month outcome assessments by way of correlation. Furthermore, the preliminary results indicate an association of further brain regions and structures with three month NIHSS outcome assessments. Hence, prediction models might observe an increased accuracy when incorporating regional (instead of global) lesion loads. Also, the results lend support to the clinical utilization of the automatically predicted volumes from FASTER, rather than the simpler DWI and PWI lesion delineations.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested asymmetries in brain diffusivity may exist. The purpose of this study was to assess whether water diffusivity in deep gray matter structures shown by diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging differs between the right and left cerebral hemispheres in normal individuals.
METHODS: Brain MR imaging was obtained in 23 healthy volunteers. A multisection image without diffusion weighting, and images with weighting applied in the read, phase, and section directions with a b-factor of 1000 smm(2) were collected. Diffusivity was computed separately in each direction, and the results were averaged to form mean diffusivity maps. Quantitative diffusivity values were obtained from the globus pallidus, putamen, caudate, thalamus, white matter, and CSF by using a standardized region of interest template. Interhemispheric differences were assessed by using a paired sample t test.; RESULTS: Mean diffusivity was higher in the: left (mean +- SD: 0.689 x 10(-3) +- 0.069 x 10(-3)mm(2)s) versus right (0.642 X 10(-3) +- 0.071 X 10(-3)mm(2)s) caudate (% difference, P value: 7.0%, P = .001); right (0.745 x 10(-3) +- 0.053 X 10(-3)mm(2)s) versus left (0.706 X 10(-3) +- 0.050 x 10(-3)mm(2)s) globus pallidus (5.2%, P < .001); left (0.720 x 10(-3) +- 0.059 x 10(-3)mm(2)s) versus right (0.674 X 10(-3) +- 0.052 X 10(-3)mm(2)s) putamen (6.4%, P < .001); right (0.750 X 10(-3) +- 10(-3) +- 0.040 X 10(-3)mm(2)s) versus left (0.716 X 10(-3) +- 0.031 X 10(-3)mm(2)s) thalamus (4.5%, P < .001). No significant right versus left difference was seen in the CSF (P = .291), anterior frontal white matter (P = .834), or centrum semiovale (P = .320).; CONCLUSION. Gray matter diffusivity may differ between hemispheres of the brain in healthy individuals. Analysis of deep gray matter lesions requires caution, as statistically significant interhemispheric differences may not always be indicative of disease.

N2  -  Background Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are primary diffuse slow-growing brain tumors derived from glial cells. The management of these tumors is dependent on their location, which often harbors eloquent areas. We retrospectively recorded the location of diffuse gliomas to identify whether specific differences exist between the histological types. Methods We analyzed 102 patients with previous histological diagnosis of WHO-II astrocytomas (62) and WHO-II oligodendrogliomas (40) according to WHO-2016 classification. MRI sequences (T2-FLAIR) were used for tumor volume segmentation and to create a frequency map of their locations within the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The Brain-Grid (BG) system (standardized radiological tool of intersected lines according to anatomical landmarks) was created and merged with a tractography atlas for infiltration analysis. Results Astrocytomas frequently infiltrated association and projection white matter pathways within fronto-temporo-insular regions on the left side. Oligodendrogliomas infiltrated larger white matter networks (association-commissural-projection) of the frontal lobe bilaterally. A critical number of infiltrated BG voxels (7 for astrocytomas, 10 for oligodendrogliomas) significantly predicted shorter overall survival (OS) in both groups. Bilateral tumor extension in astrocytomas and preoperative tumor volume in oligodendrogliomas were independent prognostic factors for shorter OS. Conclusions Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas differ in preferential location, and this has an impact on the type and the extent of white matter involvement. The number of BG voxels infiltrated reflected different tumor invasiveness and its impact on OS in both groups. All this new information may be valuable in neurosurgical oncology to classify and plan treatment for patients with diffuse gliomas.

N2  -  We have previously shown that activation of RhoA by bradykinin (BK) is associated with cytoskeleton rearrangement, tight junction (TJ) protein disassembly, and an increase in blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs). Subsequently, we investigated whether Rho-kinases (ROCKs), a family of downstream effectors of activated RhoA known to stimulate F-actin rearrangement, play a key role in the above-mentioned processes in RBMECs. Our study uses primary RBMECs as an in vitro BTB model and a specific ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) and ROCK II small interfering RNA (siRNA) to establish whether ROCK plays a role in the process of TJ opening by BK. Y-27632 and ROCK II siRNA could partially inhibit endothelial leakage and restored normal transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) values in RBMECs. A shift in occludin and claudin-5 distribution from insoluble to soluble fractions was prevented by Y-27632. Additionally, Y-27632 inhibited BK-induced relocation of occludin and claudin-5 from cellular borders into the cytoplasm as well as stress fiber formation in RBMECs. A time-dependent increase in phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) and phosphorylated cofilin (p-cofilin) by BK was observed, which was also inhibited by Y-27632. An increase in ROCK activity by BK was inhibited by Y-27632. ROCK's contribution to BK-induced stress fiber formation is associated with TJ disassembly and an increase in BTB permeability.

N2  -  Object. The authors developed a new mapping technique to overcome the temporal and spatial limitations of classic subcortical mapping of the corticospinal tract (CST). The feasibility and safety of continuous (0.4-2 Hz) and dynamic (at the site of and synchronized with tissue resection) subcortical motor mapping was evaluated.
Methods. The authors prospectively studied 69 patients who underwent tumor surgery adjacent to the CST (< 1 cm using diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tracking) with simultaneous subcortical monopolar motor mapping (short train, interstimulus interval 4 msec, pulse duration 500 mu sec) and a new acoustic motor evoked potential alarm. Continuous (temporal coverage) and dynamic (spatial coverage) mapping was technically realized by integrating the mapping probe at the tip of a new suction device, with the concept that this device will be in contact with the tissue where the resection is performed. Motor function was assessed 1 day after surgery, at discharge, and at 3 months.; Results. All procedures were technically successful. There was a 1:1 correlation of motor thresholds for stimulation sites simultaneously mapped with the new suction mapping device and the classic fingerstick probe (24 patients, 74 stimulation points; r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.001). The lowest individual motor thresholds were as follows: > 20 mA, 7 patients; 11-20 mA, 13 patients; 6-10 mA, 8 patients; 4-5 mA, 17 patients; and 1-3 mA, 24 patients. At 3 months, 2 patients (3%) had a persistent postoperative motor deficit, both of which were caused by a vascular injury. No patient had a permanent motor deficit caused by a mechanical injury of the CST.; Conclusions. Continuous dynamic mapping was found to be a feasible and ergonomic technique for localizing the exact site of the CST and distance to the motor fibers. The acoustic feedback and the ability to stimulate the tissue continuously and exactly at the site of tissue removal improves the accuracy of mapping, especially at low (<5 mA) stimulation intensities. This new technique may increase the safety of motor eloquent tumor surgery.

N2  -  Human face perception requires a network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human patient (Patient S.P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in Patient S.P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (Patient S.P. before resection vs Patient S.P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (Patient S.P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in Patient S.P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in Patient S.P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which may contribute to the stable and plastic features of the face network in Patient S.P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage.

N2  -  Odorant stimulation of receptor cells results in a calcium influx that activates the transduction pathway. Ca2+ accepters, such as calmodulin, may mediate between the change in intracellular calcium and the conductance mechanism underlying the initial electrical event. Ca2+ accepters also may participate in subsequent processing of olfactory information. The identification and characterization of these molecules, therefore, should provide important information about the complex signal transduction pathway involving calcium in olfaction as well as other sensory systems.
The present study describes the distribution of six calcium-binding proteins in the rat main olfactory epithelium during postnatal development to determine when different Ca2+ accepters can be detected and whether they segregate into different layers or portions of the epithelium. Calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin-D28k, neurocalcin, and recoverin were detected immunohistochemically in olfactory receptors but not in basal cells. S-100 immunoreactivity was restricted to glial cells primarily around the cribriform plate. During postnatal development (from P1 to P20), calmodulin, calretinin, calbindin-D28k, and neurocalcin formed a gradient of immunoreactivity descending from the central to the lateral areas in the nasal cavity, whereas recoverin was expressed only in sporadic, mature receptors in the proximal region of the mucosa. At P20, the immunoreactivity pattern for each calcium-binding protein was identical to the adult profile, indicating that the olfactory epithelium had reached maturity by this stage. Olfactory nerve fiber bundles displayed a differential staining pattern from P1 until adulthood for calbindin-D28k and calretinin (internal portions of bundles). Differential calmodulin immuno-reactivity of olfactory nerves (large external portions of bundles) appeared at P10. The immunoreactivity of the nerve fiber bundles may reflect a further degree of organization relevant to odor discrimination. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  -  Resting-state (rs) fMRI has been shown to be useful for preoperative mapping of functional areas in patients with brain tumors and epilepsy. However, its lack of standardization limits its widespread use and hinders multicenter collaboration. The American Society of Functional Neuroradiology, American Society of Pediatric Neuroradiology, and the American Society of Neuroradiology Functional and Diffusion MR Imaging Study Group recommend specific rs-fMRI acquisition approaches and preprocessing steps that will further support rs-fMRI for future clinical use. A task force with expertise in fMRI from multiple institutions provided recommendations on the rs-fMRI steps needed for mapping of language, motor, and visual areas in adult and pediatric patients with brain tumor and epilepsy. These were based on an extensive literature review and expert consensus. Following rs-fMRI acquisition parameters are recommended: minimum 6-minute acquisition time; scan with eyes open with fixation; obtain rs-fMRI before both task-based fMRI and contrast administration; temporal resolution of <= 2 seconds; scanner field strength of 3T or higher. The following rs-fMRI preprocessing steps and parameters are recommended: motion correction (seed-based correlation analysis [SBC], independent component analysis [ICA]); despiking (SBC); volume censoring (SBC, ICA); nuisance regression of CSF and white matter signals (SBC); head motion regression (SBC, ICA); bandpass filtering (SBC, ICA); and spatial smoothing with a kernel size that is twice the effective voxel size (SBC, ICA).The consensus recommendations put forth for rs-fMRI acquisition and preprocessing steps will aid in standardization of practice and guide rs-fMRI program development across institutions. Standardized rs-fMRI protocols and processing pipelines are essential for multicenter trials and to implement rs-fMRI as part of standard clinical practice.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The development of thrombolytic agents for use with compromised cerebral blood flow has made it critical to quickly identify those patients to best treat. We hypothesized that combined diffusion and perfusion MR imaging adds vital diagnostic value for patients for whom the greatest potential benefits exist and far exceeds the diagnostic value of diffusion MR imaging alone.
METHODS: The cases of patients with neurologic symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who underwent ultra-fast emergent MR imaging within 6 hours were reviewed, In all cases, automatic processing yielded isotropic diffusion images and perfusion time-to-peak maps. Images with large vessel distribution ischemia and with mismatched perfusion abnormalities were correlated with patient records. All follow-up images were reviewed and compared with outcomes resulting from hyperacute therapies.; RESULTS: For 16 (26%) of 62 patients, hypoperfusisn was the best MR imaging evidence of disease distribution, and for 15 of the 16, hypoperfusion (not abnormal diffusion) comprised the only imaging evidence for disease involving large vessels, For seven patients, diffusion imaging findings mere entirely normal, and for nine, diffusion imaging delineated abnormal signal in either small vessel distributions or in a notably smaller cortical branch in one case. III all cases, perfusion maps were predictive of eventual lesions, as confirmed by angiography CT, or subsequent MR imaging.; CONCLUSION: If only diffusion MR imaging is used in assessing patients with hyperacute stroke, nearly one quarter of the cases may be incorrectly categorized with respect to the distribution of ischemic at-risk tissue. Addition of perfusion information further enables better categorizing of vascular distribution to allow the best selection among therapeutic options and to improve patient outcomes.

N2  -  Background and Purpose: Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging is a means to characterize and differentiate morphologic features, including edema, necrosis, and tumor tissue, by measuring differences in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). We hypothesized that DW imaging has the potential to differentiate recurrent or progressive tumor growth from treatment-induced damage to brain parenchyma in high-grade gliomas after radiation therapy.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed follow-up conventional and DW MR images obtained starting 1 month after completion of radiation treatment with or without chemotherapy for histologically proved high-grade gliomas. Eighteen patients with areas of abnormal enhancing tissue were identified. ADC maps were calculated from echo-planar DW images, and mean ADC values and ADC ratios (ADC of enhancing lesion to ADC of contralateral white matter) were compared with final diagnosis. Recurrence was established by histologic examination or by clinical course and a combination of imaging studies.; Results: Recurrence and nonrecurrence could be differentiated by using mean ADC values and ADC ratios. ADC ratios in the recurrence group showed significantly lower values (mean+-SD, 1.43+-0.11) than those of the nonrecurrence group (1.82+-0.07, P<.001). Mean ADCs of the recurrent tumors (mean±SD, 1.18±0.13x10(-3) mms(2)) were significantly lower than those of the nonrecurrence group (1.40±0.17x10(-3) mms(2), p<.006).; Conclusion: Assessment of ADC ratios of enhancing regions in the follow-up of treated high-grade gliomas is useful in differentiating radiation effects from tumor recurrence or progression.

N2  -  Background The manual segmentation of intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) regions in the stroke brain is cumbersome, due to the coexistence of infarction, large blood vessels, ventricles, and intact BBB regions, specifically in areas with weak signal enhancement following contrast agent injection. Hypothesis That from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI alone, without user intervention, regions of weak BBB damage can be segmented based on the leakage-related parameter K-2 and the extent of intact BBB regions, needed to estimate K-2 values, determined. Study Type Feasibility. Animal Model Ten female Sprague-Dawley rats (SD, 200-250g) underwent 1-hour middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) and 1-day reperfusion. Two SD rats underwent 1-hour MCAO with 3-day and 5-day reperfusion. Field Strength/Sequence 7T; ADC and T-1 maps using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) and relaxation enhancement (RARE) with variable repetition time (TR), respectively. dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI using FLASH. DSC-MRI using gradient-echo EPI. Assessment Constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (cNMF) was applied to the dynamic Delta R2*-curves of DSC-MRI (<4 min) in a BBB-disrupted rat model. Areas of voxels with intact BBB, classified by automated cNMF analyses, were then used in estimating K-1 and K-2 values, and compared with corresponding values from manually-derived areas. Statistical Tests Mean +/- standard deviation of Delta T-1-differences between ischemic and healthy areas were displayed with unpaired Student's t-tests. Scatterplots were displayed with slopes and intercepts and Pearson's r values were evaluated between K-2 maps obtained with automatic (cNMF)- and manually-derived regions of interest (ROIs) of the intact BBB region. Results Mildly BBB-damaged areas (indistinguishable from DCE-MRI (10 min) parameters) were automatically segmented. Areas of voxels with intact BBB, classified by automated cNMF, matched closely the corresponding, manually-derived areas when respective areas were used in estimating K-2 maps (Pearson's r = 0.97, 12 slices). Data Conclusion Automatic segmentation of short DSC-MRI data alone successfully identified areas with intact and compromised BBB in the stroke brain and compared favorably with manual segmentation.

N2  -  Lesion-symptom mapping is a key tool in understanding the relationship between structure and function in neuroscience as it can provide objective evidence about which regions are crucial for a given process. Initial limitations with this approach were largely overcome by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), a method introduced in the early 2000s, which allows for a whole-brain approach to study the association between damaged areas and behavioral impairment by applying an independent statistical test at every voxel. By doing so, this technique eliminated the need to predefine regions of interest or classify patients into groups based on arbitrary cutoff scores. VLSM has nonetheless its own limitations; chiefly, a bias towards recognizing cortical necrosis/gliosis but with poor sensitivity for detecting injury along long white matter tracts, thus ignoring cortical disconnection, which can per se lead to behavioral impairment. Here, we propose a complementary method that, instead, establishes a statistical relationship between the strength of connections between all brain regions of the brain (as defined by a standard brain atlas) and the array of behavioral performance seen in patients with brain injury: connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping (CLSM). Whole-brain CLSM therefore has the potential to identify key connections for behavior independently of a priori assumptions with applicability across a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric diseases. We propose that this approach can further our understanding of brain-structure relationships and is worth exploring in clinical and theoretical contexts.

N2  -  The paper presents 47 adult patients who were surgically treated due to brainstem gliomas. Thirteen patients presented with contrast-enhancing Grades III and IV gliomas, according to the WHO classification, 13 patients with contrast-enhancing tumours originating from the glial cells (Grade I; WHO classification), 9 patients with diffuse gliomas, 5 patients with tectal brainstem gliomas and 7 patients with exophytic brainstem gliomas. During the surgical procedure, neuronavigation and the diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) of the corticospinal tract were used with the examination of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) with direct stimulation of the fundus of the fourth brain ventricle in order to define the localization of the nuclei of nerves VII, IX, X and XII. Cerebellar dysfunction, damage to cranial nerves and dysphagia were the most frequent postoperative sequelae which were also the most difficult to resolve. The Karnofsky score established preoperatively and the extent of tumour resection were the factors affecting the prognosis. The mean time of progression-free survival (14 months) and the mean survival time after surgery (20 months) were the shortest for malignant brainstem gliomas. In the group with tectal brainstem gliomas, no cases of progression were found and none of the patients died during the follow-up. Some patients were professionally active. Partial resection of diffuse brainstem gliomas did not prolong the mean survival above 5 years. However, some patients survived over 5 years in good condition. (C) 2018 Polish Neurological Society.

N2  -  Purpose Predicting malignant progression of grade II gliomas would allow for earlier initiation of treatment. The hypothesis for this single-centre, case-control study was that the perfusion signal on ASL-MRI predicts such malignant progression in the following 12 months. Methods Consecutive patients with the following criteria were included: >= 18 years, grade II glioma (biopsied or resected) and an ASL-MRI 6-12 months prior to malignant progression (cases) or stable disease (controls). Malignant progression was defined either radiologically (new T1w-contrast enhancement) or histologically (neurosurgical tissue sampling). Three controls were matched with each case. Some patients served as their own control by using earlier imaging. The ASL-MRIs were reviewed by two neuroradiologists and classified as positive (hyper-intense or iso-intense compared to cortical grey matter) or negative (hypo-intense). In patients with epilepsy, a neurologist reviewed clinicoradiological data to exclude peri-ictal pseudoprogression. The statistical analysis included diagnostic test properties, a Cohen's Kappa interrater reliability coefficient and stratification for previous radiotherapy. Results Eleven cases (median age = 48, IQR = 43-50 years) and 33 controls (43, 27-50 years) were included. Malignant progression appeared at 37 months (median, IQR = 17-44) after first surgery. Thirty ASL-MRIs were assessed as negative and 14 as positive. None of the MRIs showed signs of peri-ictal pseudoprogression. ASL significantly predicted subsequent malignant progression (sensitivity = 73%; specificity = 82%; OR = 12; 95%-CI = 2.4-59.1; p = 0.002). The interrater reliability coefficient was 0.65. In stratified analysis, ASL-MRI predicted malignant progression both in patients with previous radiotherapy and in those without (Mantel-Haenszel test, p = 0.003). Conclusion Perfusion imaging with ASL-MRI can predict malignant progression within 12 months in patients with grade II glioma.

N2  -  ObjectivesOur aim is to assess the subfield-specific histopathological correlates of hippocampal volume and intensity changes (T1, T2) as well as diff!usion MRI markers in TLE, and investigate the efficacy of quantitative MRI measures in predicting histopathology in vivo.
Experimental DesignWe correlated in vivo volumetry, T2 signal, quantitative T1 mapping, as well as diffusion MRI parameters with histological features of hippocampal sclerosis in a subfield-specific manner. We made use of on an advanced co-registration pipeline that provided a seamless integration of preoperative 3 T MRI with postoperative histopathological data, on which metrics of cell loss and gliosis were quantitatively assessed in CA1, CA23, and CA4DG.; Principal ObservationsMRI volumes across all subfields were positively correlated with neuronal density and size. Higher T2 intensity related to increased GFAP fraction in CA1, while quantitative T1 and diffusion MRI parameters showed negative correlations with neuronal density in CA4 and DG. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that in vivo multiparametric MRI can predict neuronal loss in all the analyzed subfields with up to 90% accuracy.; ConclusionOur results, based on an accurate co-registration pipeline and a subfield-specific analysis of MRI and histology, demonstrate the potential of MRI volumetry, diffusion, and quantitative T1 as accurate in vivo biomarkers of hippocampal pathology.

N2  -  The spastic rat is a neurological mutant of the Han-Wistar strain with prominent spasticity, tremor, and ataxia. Neurodegeneration is found in the CA3 sector of the hippocampus and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. We examined the forebrain and cerebellum of spastic rats for glial reactions by using immunolabelling for the astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). First, a map of the GFAP-distribution was made representing a systematic series of frontal sections in controls. Reactive astrocytes with increased GFAP should occur in the areas with established neuronal degeneration, but they could also demarcate further regions with pathology in this rat strain. Since the baseline levels of GFAP-immunoreactivity differ between brain regions, control rats and clinically normal littermates served as controls to judge relative increases in major structures. In the CA3 sector and hilus of the dorsal hippocampus, a massive gliosis was detected. In the cerebellum, a patchy increase of GFAP labelling in Bergmann glia was found. Further increases of GFAP-labelling in reactive astrocytes occurred in fiber tracts, the ventral thalamic nuclei, medial geniculate nuclei, pontine region and optic layer of the superior colliculus. Inconsistent changes were noted in cortex and pallidum. No defects of glial labelling or malformations in glial architectonics were found. The reactive changes of astroglial cells in hippocampus and cerebellum are in proportion to the neuronal degeneration. The glial reactions in the other brain regions possibly reflect a reaction to fiber degeneration and incipient neuronal degeneration or functional alterations of glial cells in response to neuronal dysfunction.

N2  -  Of the three major types of opioid receptors (mu, delta, kappa) in the nervous system, mu-opioid receptor shows the highest affinity for morphine that exerts powerful effects on nociceptive, autonomic, and psychological functions. So far, at least two isoforms of mu-opioid receptors have been cloned from rat brain. The present study attempted to examine immunohistochemically the distribution of mu-opioid receptors in the rat central nervous system with two kinds of antibodies to recently cloned mu-opioid receptors (MOR1 and MOR1B). One antibody recognized a specific site for MOR1, and the other bound to a common site for MOR1 and MOR1B.
Intense MOR1-like immunoreactivity (LI) was seen in the 'patch' areas and subcallosal streak in the striatum, medial habenular nucleus, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe nucleus, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, ambiguus nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and laminae I and II of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns. Many other regions, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus, also contained many neuronal elements with MOR1-LI. The distribution pattern of the immunoreactivity revealed with the antibody to the common site for MOR1 and MOR1B (MOR11B-LI) was almost the same as that of MOR1-LI. Both MOR1-LI and MOR11B-LI were primarily located in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. However, the immunoreactivities were observed in the accessory optic tract, fasciculus retroflexus, solitary tract, and primary afferent fibers in the superficial layers of the medullary and spinal dorsal horns. The presynaptic location of MOR1-LI and MOR11B-LI was confirmed by lesion experiments: Enucleation, placing a lesion in the medial habenular nucleus, removal of the nodose ganglion, or dorsal rhizotomy resulted in a clear reduction of the immunoreactivities, respectively, in the nuclei of the accessory optic tract, some subnuclei of the interpeduncular nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, or laminae I and II of the spinal dorsal horn.; The results indicate that the mu-opioid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord, mainly postsynaptically and occasionally presynaptically. Opioids, including morphine, may inhibit the excitation of neurons via the postsynaptic mu-opioid receptors, and also suppress the release of neurotransmitters andor neuromodulators from axon terminals through the presynaptic mu-opioid receptors.

N2  -  In addition to a large (chimpanzee-sized) and heavily convoluted brain, one of the most striking neurobiological features in pinnipeds is the large size of the head of the caudate nucleus, which dwarfs the rest of the striatum. Although previous research has suggested carnivore striatum is small in comparison to that of primates, there are limited volumetric data on separate striatal structures in carnivores. Therefore, the apparent functional implication of a potentially hypertrophic caudate to carnivores has not been discussed. Here, for the first time, we obtained separate volumetric measurements of caudate and putamen in California sea lions and coyotes. Exemplars of both species had very large caudate nuclei, approximately 1/75th of total brain volume. In both the sea lion and coyote, the caudate dwarfed the putamen at a ratio of 13 to 1 or greater, a finding in strong contrast to measurements showing larger putamen than caudate in primates. In addition, using post-mortem diffusion tensor brain imaging, we mapped and compared white matter connections between the dorsal caudate and the motor, premotor and frontopolar, and orbitofrontal cortices in healthy adult sea lions and healthy adult coyotes. The sea lions showed some evidence of greater premotor and frontopolar connectivity. These findings bear on previously underexplored striatal characteristics of large carnivores, and we discuss potential interpretations related to cognitive flexibility and sensorimotor transformation.

N2  -  Introduction: Over the past 20 years, the spectrum of neonatal neurological malformations has changed due to the diffusion of ultrasound, performed either routinely or as required by maternal alpha-fetoprotein screening or history. Discussion: We review and illustrate the potential of ultrasound for the prenatal diagnosis of abnormalities in size or shape of the skull (macrocephaly, microcephaly, craniostenosis), neural tube defects, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, posterior fossa defects (abnormalities in the size of the cisterna magna, cerebellar abnormalities), midline abnormalities (holoprosencephaly, abnormalities of the corpus callosum), ischemic lesions and hemorrhage, tumours, and focalized hyperechogenic images. The limits of fetal ultrasound screening and of the various diagnostic strategies implemented when a fetal brain abnormality is suspected are discussed. Overall, gross lethal abnormalities such as anencephaly or major hydrocephaly are accessible to prenatal sonographic screening, and nearly always result in termination of the pregnancy. However, hydrocephaly may progress late in gestation and remain undiscovered unless a third trimester ultrasound is performed. A majority of cases with myelomeningocele are diagnosed prenatally, resulting either in termination of the pregnancy or in neonatal management. A growing number of more subtle abnormalities, including midline or posterior fossa abnormalities can be spotted by fetal ultrasound, but their postnatal outcome cannot always be predicted accurately, despite the use of fetal magnetic resonance imaging. In such cases, a trans-disciplinary approach involving perinatologists, pediatric radiologists, neuropathologists, neurosurgeons or neurologists familiar with neonates is crucial to counseling the parents. Some brain abnormalities are still extremely difficult or even impossible to diagnose in utero despite advances in sonographic imaging. This is due to the fact that severe neurological impairment may result from conditions that do not affect substantially affect the morphology of the brain, and that major structural abnormalities may develop late in gestation, and thus remain undetected at second trimester ultrasound. Conclusion: Ultrasound screening identifies a growing number of central nervous system abnormalities, resulting in substantial changes in the neonatal presentation of neurological congenital abnormalities.

N2  -  Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEP) were studied both with vertex (positive) - tragus (negative) derivation and three-channel Lissajous'' trajectory (3-CLT) planar analysis in guinea pigs (GP) after destruction of the ipsilateral superior olivary complex (SOC) (6 GGP), contralateral SOC (8 GP) referred to the stimulation side, and trapezoid body (TB) in the sagittal line (8 GP). The size of the lesion was evaluated on histological examination. The right ear was locally destroyed with aminoside instillation. The left ear was stimulated with unfiltered clicks and tone bursts of different frequencies at 100 dB SPL. Three questions were the basis of this study: (i) What are the effects of brainstem lesions on 3-CLT? (ii) Is there a relationship between planar segments and underlying sources?(iii) What is the generator of planar segment C (P3) in GP? 3-CLT analysis was made on plane A (corresponding to P1 on a vertex-tragus channel), plane B (N1-P2) and plane C (P3). Plane C disappeared after TB lesions and remained after ipsi- and contralateral SOC destructions. However, plance C disappeared after extensive lesions to the contralateral SOC affecting the TB. Planes A and B were always observed whatever the lesion, with sometimes a modification of their orientation. A localized brainstem lesion induced a local modification of their orientation. A localized branstem lesion induced a local modification of the three-dimensional trajectory. These data are in agreement with the assumption that some planes of 3-CLT reflect the activity of underlying generators. However, the loop which contains the planar segment is a better indicator of the global electrical activity of the source. Plane C (P3) would have a contralateral source which is probably not the SOC but that afferent curved fibers of the TB close to the contralateral SOC.

N2  -  The cytoskeletal integrity of human and rodent cell lines was analyzed using site-directed monoclonal antibodies prepared from hybridomas. Secreting hybridomas were produced by immunizing mice with synthetic peptides from the C-terminal domain of the betaII-tubulin isotype, betaII(422-434), YQQYQDATADEQG, and the first imperfect repeat from brain tau, Tau-I(187-204), VRSKIGSTENLKHQPGGG. Two hybridomas were selected for this work: MTB6.22, an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody, which was obtained from a mouse immunized with the betaII-peptide and recognizes specific tubulin-binding domains on MAP-2 and tau; and TauI/1, which recognizes the repetitive binding sequences on tau and MAP-2. Immunoblots of cytoskeletal protein preparations from the five different tumor cell lines studied, showed the interaction of the site-directed antibodies MTB6.22 and Tau-I/1 with a group of proteins that co-migrate with brain tau. Immunoreactive tau components were also identified using an anti-tau monoclonal antibody (clone Tau-2), and several polyclonal anti-tau antibodies that interact with tau epitopes, other than those of the tubulin-binding domains. These tau-like proteins bound to a calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column and were eluted using 2 mM EGTA. Interestingly, washing the extracted cytoskeleton pellet with 5x10(-3) M Ca2+ for short periods of time selectively released the tau-like protein components, whilst most of the other cytoskeletal proteins remained in the pellet. On the other hand, immunofluorescence microscopy of detergent-extracted cells showed immunostaining of MAP components that appear to be co-localized in a discrete dot-like distribution along the stress fibers, which were revealed using rhodamine-phallacidin. Further support for the specificity of tau interaction with sites on tubulin and actin polymers was obtained with double-immunofluorescence, using the MAP-reactive monoclonal antibody MTB6.22 and a polyclonal antibody to a tubulin peptide containing part of the tau-binding domain on tubulin.
Considering the anti-idiotypic nature of the MTB6.22 monoclonal antibody, our studies indicate that, in all the cell lines analyzed, a tau-like protein component is involved in mediating the interaction of both actin and tubulin polymers.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The etiology, clinicopathological features, and prognosis of cancer in cases with EGFR mutations are different from those without mutations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the differences in ADC histogram analysis in brain metastases with EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma cases and the relationship between ADC histogram analysis differences and overall survival.; METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, 30 patients (8 EGFR+22 EGFR-) and 51 brain metastases (15 EGFR+36 EGFR-) were included. ROI markings are first performed from each section, including metastasis in ADC mapping using FIREVOXEL software. Next, ADC histogram parameters are calculated. Overall survival analysis after brain metastasis (OSBM) is defined as the time from initial brain metastasis diagnosis to the time of death or last follow-up. Patient-based (by evaluating the largest lesion) and lesion-based (by evaluating all measurable lesions) statistical analyses are then performed.; RESULTS: In the lesion-based analysis, skewness values are lower in EGFR+ patients, which is statistically significant (p = 0.012). The two groups have no significant difference regarding other ADC histogram analysis parameters, mortality, and overall survival (p > 0.05). In the ROC analysis, the most appropriate skewness cut-off value is determined as 0.321 to distinguish the EGFR mutation difference, and this value is statistically significant (sensitivity: 66.7%, specificity: 80.6%, AUC: 0.730) (p = 0.006).; CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the differences in ADC histogram analysis according to EGFR mutation status in brain metastases due to lung adenocarcinoma. The identified parameters, especially skewness, are potentially non-invasive biomarkers for predicting mutation status. Incorporating these biomarkers into routine clinical practice may aid treatment decision-making and prognostic assessment for patients. Further validation studies and prospective investigations are warranted to confirm the clinical utility of these findings and establish their potential for personalized therapeutic strategies and patient outcomes.

N2  -  Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a method that can provide quantitative information about perfusion in the human body, in vivo, and without contrast agent. Unfortunately, the IVIM perfusion parameter maps are known to be relatively noisy in the brain, in particular for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient, which might hinder its potential broader use in clinical applications. Therefore, we studied the conditions to produce optimal IVIM perfusion images in the brain. IVIM imaging was performed on a 3-Tesla clinical system in four healthy volunteers, with 16 b values 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 110, 140, 170, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 s/mm(2), repeated 20 times. We analyzed the noise characteristics of the trace images as a function of b-value, and the homogeneity of the IVIM parameter maps across number of averages and sub-sets of the acquired b values. We found two peaks of noise of the trace images as function of b value, one due to thermal noise at high b-value, and one due to physiological noise at low b-value. The selection of b value distribution was found to have higher impact on the homogeneity of the IVIM parameter maps than the number of averages. Based on evaluations, we suggest an optimal b value acquisition scheme for a 12 min scan as 0 (7), 20 (4), 140 (19), 300 (9), 500 (19), 700 (1), 800 (4), 900 (1) s/mm(2).

N2  -  Purpose Surgical devices or systems typically operate in a stand-alone manner, making it difficult to perform integration analysis of both intraoperative anatomical and functional information. To address this issue, the intraoperative information integration system OPeLiNK (R) was developed. The objective of this study is to generate information for decision making using surgical navigation and intraoperative monitoring information accumulated in the OPeLiNK (R) database and to analyze its utility.
Methods We accumulated intraoperative information from 27 brain tumor patients who underwent resection surgery. First, the risk rank for postoperative paralysis was set according to the attenuation rate and amplitude width of the motor evoked potential (MEP). Then, the MEP and navigation log data were combined and plotted on an intraoperative magnetic resonance image of the individual brain. Finally, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) transformation was performed to generate a standard brain risk map of postoperative paralysis. Additionally, we determined the anatomical high-risk areas using atlases and analyzed the relationship with each set risk rank.; Results The average distance between the navigation log corresponding to each MEP risk rank and the anatomical high-risk area differed significantly between the with postoperatively paralyzed and without postoperatively paralyzed groups, except for "safe." Furthermore, no excessive deformation was observed resulting from SPM conversion to create the standard brain risk map. There were cases in which no postoperative paralysis occurred even when MEP decreased intraoperatively, and vice versa.; Conclusion The time synchronization reliability of the study data is very high. Therefore, our created risk map can be reported as being functional at indicating the risk areas. Our results suggest that the statistical risks of postoperative complications can be presented for each area where brain surgery is to be performed. In the future, it will be possible to provide surgical navigation with intraoperative support that reflects the risk maps created.

N2  -  Purpose: To study the time course of diffusion imaging at the lesion site in brainstem infarcts.
Materials and Methods: Sequential MR scans were acquired from 24 patients with brainstem infarcts. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI), T-2-weighted images (T(2)w), maps of apparent diffusion coefficient, and maps of fractional anisotropy were generated from each MR scan. A trend function was fitted to these measurements to model an objective, general time course of the studied parameters.; Results: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) continuously decreased over time until a:, transition, time, around: 45 hours; afterwards a continous increase took place. After the 14th day ADC reached values similar to the ADC of the intact contralateral side, (pseudonormalization) and then further increased. Fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased continuously over 3 to 6 months.; Conclusion: Times of transition and pseudonormalization of ADC were longer than described for territorial hemispheric infarcts and describe the acute to subacute phase of brainstem ischemia. In contrast, the continuous decline of FA over 3 to 6 months indicates a chronic process of chance of histological structures in brain stem ischemia, and may be regarded as an indicator of the chronic phase.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with recurrent glioblastoma often exhibit regions of diffusion restriction following the initiation of bevacizumab therapy. Studies suggest that these regions represent either diffusion-restricted necrosis or hypercellular tumor. This study explored postmortem brain specimens and a population analysis of overall survival to determine the identity and implications of such lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmortem examinations were performed on 6 patients with recurrent glioblastoma on bevacizumab with progressively growing regions of diffusion restriction. ADC values were extracted from regions of both hypercellular tumor and necrosis. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to define optimal ADC thresholds for differentiating tissue types. A retrospective population study was also performed comparing the overall survival of 64 patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab. Patients were separated into 3 groups: no diffusion restriction, diffusion restriction that appeared and progressed within 5 months of bevacizumab initiation, and delayed or stable diffusion restriction. An additional analysis was performed assessing tumor O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase methylation.; RESULTS: The optimal ADC threshold for differentiation of hypercellularity and necrosis was 0.736 x 10(-3)mm(2)s. Progressively expanding diffusion restriction was pathologically confirmed to be coagulative necrosis surrounded by viable tumor. Progressive lesions were associated with the worst overall survival, while stable lesions showed the greatest overall survival (P<.05). Of the 40% of patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase methylated tumors, none developed diffusion-restricted lesions.; CONCLUSIONS: Progressive diffusion-restricted lesions were pathologically confirmed to be coagulative necrosis surrounded by viable tumor and associated with decreased overall survival. Stable lesions were, however, associated with increased overall survival. All lesions were associated with O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase unmethylated tumors.

N2  -  Purpose: A fast, reliable and non-invasive method is required in differentiating brain metastases (BMs) originating from lung cancer (LC) and breast cancer (BC). The aims of this study were to assess the role of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in differentiating BMs originated from LC and BC, and then to investigate further the association of ADC histogram parameters with Ki-67 index in BMs.
Methods: A total of 55 patients (LC, N = 40; BC, N = 15) with BMs histopathologically confirmed were enrolled in the study. The LC group was divided into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC; N = 15) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; N = 25) groups. ADC histogram parameters (ADC(max), ADC(mean), ADC(min), ADC(median), ADC(10), ADC(25), ADC(75) and ADC(90), skewness, kurtosis and entropy) were derived from ADC maps. Mann-Whitney U-test, independent samples t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Spearman correlation analysis were used for statistical assessment.; Results: ADC histogram parameters did not show significant differences between LC and BC groups (p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that various ADC histogram parameters were found to be statistically lower in the SCLC group compared to the NSCLC and BC groups (p < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that ADC(mean) and ADC(10) for differentiating SCLC BMs from NSCLC, and ADC(25) for differentiating SCLC BMs from BC achieved optimal diagnostic performances. Various histogram parameters were found to be significantly correlated with Ki-67 (p < 0.05).; Conclusion: Histogram analysis of ADC maps may reflect tumoural proliferation potential in BMs and can be useful in differentiating SCLC BMs from NSCLC and BC BMs.

N2  -  This paper investigates the problem of atlas registration of brain images with gliomas. Multiparametric imaging modalities (T1, T1-CE, T2, and FLAIR) are first utilized for segmentations of different tissues, and to compute the posterior probability map (PBM) of membership to each tissue class, using supervised learning. Similar maps are generated in the initially normal atlas, by modeling the tumor growth, using reaction-diffusion equation. Deformable registration using a demons-like algorithm is used to register the patient images with the tumor bearing atlas. Joint estimation of the simulated tumor parameters (e.g., location, mass effect and degree of infiltration), and the spatial transformation is achieved by maximization of the log-likelihood of observation. An expectation-maximization algorithm is used in registration process to estimate the spatial transformation and other parameters related to tumor simulation are optimized through asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPSPACK). The proposed method has been evaluated on five simulated data sets created by statistically simulated deformations (SSD), and fifteen real multichannel glioma data sets. The performance has been evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the results have been compared to ORBIT, an alternative method solving a similar problem. The results show that our method outperforms ORBIT, and the warped templates have better similarity to patient images.

N2  -  BackgroundSmall deep infarcts constitute a well-known risk of motor and speech deficit in insulo-opercular glioma surgery. However, the risk of cognitive deterioration in relation to stroke occurrence in so-called silent areas is poorly known. In this paper, we propose to build a distribution map of small deep infarcts in glioma surgery, and to analyze patients' cognitive outcome in relation to stroke occurrence.MethodsWe retrospectively studied a consecutive series of patients operated on for a diffuse glioma between June 2011and June 2017. Patients with lower-grade glioma were cognitively assessed, both before and 4months after surgery. Areas of decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on the immediate postoperative MRI were segmented. All images were registered in the MNI reference by ANTS algorithm, allowing to build a distribution map of the strokes. Stroke occurrence was correlated with the postoperative changes in semantic fluency score in the lower-grade glioma cohort.ResultsOne hundred fifteen patients were included. Areas of reduced ADC were observed in 27 out of 54 (50%) patients with a lower-grade glioma, and 25 out of 61 (41%) patients with a glioblastoma. Median volume was 1.6cc. The distribution map revealed five clusters of deep strokes, corresponding respectively to callosal, prefrontal, insulo-opercular, parietal, and temporal tumor locations. No motor nor speech long-term deficits were caused by these strokes. Cognitive evaluations at 4months showed that the presence of small infarcts correlated with a slight decrease of semantic fluency scores.ConclusionDeep small infarcts are commonly found after glioma surgery, but their actual impact in terms of patients' quality of life remains to be demonstrated. Further studies are needed to better evaluate the cognitive consequencesif anyfor each of the described hotspots and to identify risk factors other than the surgery-induced damage of microvessels.

N2  -  PurposeWide-field imaging Mueller polarimetry is a revolutionary, label-free, and non-invasive modality for computer-aided intervention; in neurosurgery, it aims to provide visual feedback of white matter fibre bundle orientation from derived parameters. Conventionally, robust polarimetric parameters are estimated after averaging multiple measurements of intensity for each pair of probing and detected polarised light. Long multi-shot averaging, however, is not compatible with real-time in vivo imaging, and the current performance of polarimetric data processing hinders the translation to clinical practice. MethodsA learning-based denoising framework is tailored for fast, single-shot, noisy acquisitions of polarimetric intensities. Also, performance-optimised image processing tools are devised for the derivation of clinically relevant parameters. The combination recovers accurate polarimetric parameters from fast acquisitions with near-real-time performance, under the assumption of pseudo-Gaussian polarimetric acquisition noise. ResultsThe denoising framework is trained, validated, and tested on experimental data comprising tumour-free and diseased human brain samples in different conditions. Accuracy and image quality indices showed significant (p<0.05\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$p < 0.05$$\end{document}) improvements on testing data for a fast single-pass denoising versus the state-of-the-art and high polarimetric image quality standards. The computational time is reported for the end-to-end processing. Conclusion:The end-to-end image processing achieved real-time performance for a localised field of view (approximate to 6.5mm2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\approx 6.5\ \text {mm}<^>2$$\end{document}). The denoised polarimetric intensities produced visibly clear directional patterns of neuronal fibre tracts in line with reference polarimetric image quality standards; directional disruption was kept in case of neoplastic lesions. The presented advances pave the way towards feasible oncological neurosurgical translations of novel, label-free, interventional feedback.

N2  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a unique method to reveal the integrity of white matter microstructure noninvasively. Voxel-based analysis (VBA), which is a highly reproducible and user-independent technique, has been used to analyze DTI data in a number of studies. Fractional anisotropy (FA), which is derived from DTI, is the most frequently used parameter. The parameter setting during the DTI data preprocessing might affect the FA analysis results. However, there is no reliable evidence on how the parameters affect the results of FA analysis. This study sought to quantitatively investigate the factors that might affect the voxel-based analysis of FA; these include the interpolation during spatial normalization, smoothing kernel and statistical threshold. Because it is difficult to obtain the true information of the lesion in the patients, we simulated lesions on the healthy FA maps. The DTI data were obtained from 20 healthy subjects. The FA maps were calculated using DTIStudio. We randomly divided these FA maps into two groups. One was used as a model patient group, and the other was used as a normal control group. Simulated lesions were added to the model patient group by decreasing the FA intensities in a specified region by 5 %-50 %. The model patient group and the normal control group were compared by two-sample t test statistic analysis voxel-by-voxel to detect the simulated lesions. We evaluated these factors by comparing the difference between the detected lesion through VBA and the simulated lesion. The result showed that the space normalization of FA image should use the trilinear interpolation, and the smoothing kernel should be 2-3 times the voxel size of spatially normalized FA image. For lesions with small intensity change, FWE correction must be cautiously used. This study provided an important reference to the analysis of FA with VBA method.

N2  -  The aim of this study was to investigate the advantages of DTI, 3D-FSPGR, and BOLD-fMRI combined with neuronavigation for precise tumor resection in brain functional areas. 40 patients with intracranial tumors were retrospectively selected and divided into two groups according to their wishes. The study group (S) were performed scanning with three sequences (DTI, 3D-FSPGR, and BOLD-fMRI) combined with neuronavigation guided fusion imaging for intracranial tumor resection according to intraoperative imaging suggestions. The control group (C) were only performed conventional enhanced MRI and resected the intracranial mass using the conventional manner. All the operations were performed by the same surgeon. T-test and chi-square test were used to compare the operation time, rate of surgical resection, and KPS scores before and after surgery. Group S had less operation time while higher resection rate and better postoperative effect than Group C. DTI, 3D-FSPGR, and BOLD-fMRI combined with neuronavigation can better locate the tumor in the intracranial functional area and improve the accuracy of intracranial resection, thus improving patients' quality of life.

N2  -  Using a whole-brain level movie atlas, Ono et al. clarified white matter dynamic circuitry of alpha waves-posterior dominant rhythms at 8-12 Hz reactive to eye opening and closure-among the most fundamental EEG findings in clinical practice and research since Hans Berger first documented them in the early 20th century.
Alpha waves-posterior dominant rhythms at 8-12 Hz reactive to eye opening and closure-are among the most fundamental EEG findings in clinical practice and research since Hans Berger first documented them in the early 20th century. Yet, the exact network dynamics of alpha waves in regard to eye movements remains unknown. High-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz is also reactive to eye movements and a summary measure of local cortical activation supporting sensorimotor or cognitive function. We aimed to build the first-ever brain atlases directly visualizing the network dynamics of eye movement-related alpha and high-gamma modulations, at cortical and white matter levels. We studied 28 patients (age: 5-20 years) who underwent intracranial EEG and electro-oculography recordings. We measured alpha and high-gamma modulations at 2167 electrode sites outside the seizure onset zone, interictal spike-generating areas and MRI-visible structural lesions. Dynamic tractography animated white matter streamlines modulated significantly and simultaneously beyond chance, on a millisecond scale. Before eye-closure onset, significant alpha augmentation occurred at the occipital and frontal cortices. After eye-closure onset, alpha-based functional connectivity was strengthened, while high gamma-based connectivity was weakened extensively in both intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric pathways involving the central visual areas. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus supported the strengthened alpha co-augmentation-based functional connectivity between occipital and frontal lobe regions, whereas the posterior corpus callosum supported the inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between the occipital lobes. After eye-opening offset, significant high-gamma augmentation and alpha attenuation occurred at occipital, fusiform and inferior parietal cortices. High gamma co-augmentation-based functional connectivity was strengthened, whereas alpha-based connectivity was weakened in the posterior inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric white matter pathways involving central and peripheral visual areas. Our results do not support the notion that eye closure-related alpha augmentation uniformly reflects feedforward or feedback rhythms propagating from lower to higher order visual cortex, or vice versa. Rather, proactive and reactive alpha waves involve extensive, distinct white matter networks that include the frontal lobe cortices, along with low- and high-order visual areas. High-gamma co-attenuation coupled to alpha co-augmentation in shared brain circuitry after eye closure supports the notion of an idling role for alpha waves during eye closure. These normative dynamic tractography atlases may improve understanding of the significance of EEG alpha waves in assessing the functional integrity of brain networks in clinical practice; they also may help elucidate the effects of eye movements on task-related brain network measures observed in cognitive neuroscience research.

N2  -  Background and Purpose Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; AX200; Filgrastim) is a stroke drug candidate with excellent preclinical evidence for efficacy. A previous phase IIa dose-escalation study suggested potential efficacy in humans. The present large phase IIb trial was powered to detect clinical efficacy in acute ischemic stroke patients.
Methods G-CSF (135 mu gkg body weight intravenous over 72 hours) was tested against placebo in 328 patients in a multinational, multicenter, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (NCT00927836; www.clinicaltrial.gov). Main inclusion criteria were 9-hour time window after stroke onset, infarct localization in the middle cerebral artery territory, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score range of 6 to 22, and baseline diffusion-weighted imaging lesion size 15 mL. Primary and secondary end points were the modified Rankin scale score and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at day 90, respectively. Data were analyzed using a prespecified model that adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, and initial infarct volume (diffusion-weighted imaging).; Results G-CSF treatment failed to meet the primary and secondary end points of the trial. For additional end points such as mortality, Barthel index, or infarct size at day 30, G-CSF did not show efficacy either. There was, however, a trend for reduced infarct growth in the G-CSF group. G-CSF showed the expected peripheral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, with a strong increase in leukocytes and monocytes. In parallel, the cytokine profile showed a significant decrease of interleukin-1.; Conclusions G-CSF, a novel and promising drug candidate with a comprehensive preclinical and clinical package, did not provide any significant benefit with respect to either clinical outcome or imaging biomarkers.; Clinical Trial Registration URL: http:www.clinicaltrials.gov.

N2  -  Objective: The purpose of this study was to differentiate true progression from pseudoprogression of glioblastomas treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ) by using histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized cerebral blood volume (nCBV) maps.
Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with histopathologically proven glioblastoma who had received CCRT with TMZ underwent perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 0, 1000 secmm(2)). The corresponding nCBV and ADC maps for the newly visible, entirely enhancing lesions were calculated after the completion of CCRT with TMZ. Two observers independently measured the histogram parameters of the nCBV and ADC maps. The histogram parameters between the true progression group (n = 10) and the pseudoprogression group (n = 10) were compared by use of an unpaired Student's t test and subsequent multivariable stepwise Logistic regression analysis to determine the best predictors for the differential diagnosis between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to determine the best cutoff values for the histogram parameters that proved to be significant predictors for differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine the level of inter-observer reliability for the histogram parameters.; Results: The 5th percentile value (C5) of the cumulative ADC histograms was a significant predictor for the differential diagnosis between true progression and pseudoprogression (p = 0.044 for observer 1; p = 0.011 for observer 2). Optimal cutoff values of 892 x 10(-6) mm(2)sec for observer 1 and 907 x 10(-5) mm(2)sec for observer 2 could help differentiate between the two groups with a sensitivity of 90% and 80%, respectively, a specificity of 90% and 80%, respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.880 and 0.840, respectively. There was no other significant differentiating parameter on the nCBV histograms. Inter-observer reliability was excellent or good for all histogram parameters (intraclass correlation coefficient range: 0.70-0.99).; Conclusion: The C5 of the cumulative ADC histogram can be a promising parameter for the differentiation of true progression from pseudoprogression of newly visible, entirely enhancing Lesions after CCRT with TMZ for glioblastomas.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fractional tumor burden better correlates with histologic tumor volume fraction in treated glioblastoma than other perfusion metrics such as relative CBV. We defined fractional tumor burden classes with low and high blood volume to distinguish tumor from treatment effect and to determine whether fractional tumor burden can inform treatment-related decision-making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with high-grade gliomas (primarily glioblastoma) with recurrent contrast-enhancing lesions on DSC-MR imaging were retrospectively evaluated after surgical sampling. Histopathologic examination defined treatment effect versus tumor. Normalized relative CBV thresholds of 1.0 and 1.75 were used to define low, intermediate, and high fractional tumor burden classes in each histopathologically defined group. Performance was assessed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Consensus agreement among physician raters reporting hypothetic changes in treatment-related decisions based on fractional tumor burden was compared with actual real-time treatment decisions.; RESULTS: Mean lower fractional tumor burden, high fractional tumor burden, and relative CBV of the contrast-enhancing volume were significantly different between treatment effect and tumor (P = .002, P < .001, and P < .001), with tumor having significantly higher fractional tumor burden and relative CBV and lower fractional tumor burden. No significance was found with intermediate fractional tumor burden. Performance of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was the following: high fractional tumor burden, 0.85; low fractional tumor burden, 0.7; and relative CBV, 0.81. In comparing treatment decisions, there were disagreements in 7% of tumor and 44% of treatment effect cases; in the latter, all disagreements were in cases with scattered atypical cells.; CONCLUSIONS: High fractional tumor burden and low fractional tumor burden define fractions of the contrast-enhancing lesion volume with high and low blood volume, respectively, and can differentiate treatment effect from tumor in recurrent glioblastomas. Fractional tumor burden maps can also help to inform clinical decision-making.

N2  -  Object. Microsurgical removal is the preferred treatment for most deep-seated, intraaxial tumors in the pediatric population. The feasibility of surgery as an option has improved with advances in surgical technology and technique. Tubular retractors disperse retraction forces over a greater surface area than do conventional retractors, which can lower the risk of ischemic complications. The authors describe their experience utilizing a new tubular retractor system specifically designed for cranial applications in conjunction with frameless neuronavigation.
Methods. The Vycor ViewSite retractor was used in 4 pediatric patients (ages 15 months and 9, 10, and 16 years) with deep-seated intraaxial tumors. The lesions included a papillary tumor of the pineal region, a low-grade astrocytoma in the occipital lobe, a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor arising from the basal ganglia, and an intraventricular low-grade glioma. The extent of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory (based on T2 or FLAIR and diffusion restrictionapparent diffusion coefficient signals) and the extent of resection were assessed on postoperative imaging.; Results. Satisfactory resection or biopsy was achieved in all patients. A comparison of pre- and postoperative MR imaging studies revealed evidence of white matter damage along the surgical trajectory in 1 patient. None of the patients demonstrated new neurological deficits postoperatively.; Conclusions. Obtaining surgical access to deep-seated, intraaxial tumors is challenging. In this small series of pediatric patients, the combination of the ViewSite tubular retractor and frameless neuronavigation facilitated the surgical approach. The combination of these technologies adds to the armamentarium to safely approach tumors in deep locations. (DOI: 10.31712011.2.PEDS10515)

N2  -  The cell plasma membrane Na+,K+-ATPase [NKA] is one of biology's most [if not the most] significant enzymes. By actively transporting Na+ out [and K+ in], it maintains the vital trans-membrane ion concentration gradients and the membrane potential. The forward NKA reaction is shown in the Graphical Abstract [which is elaborated in the text]. Crucially, NKA does not operate in isolation. There are other transporters that conduct K+ back out of [II, Graphical Abstract] and Na+ back into [III, Graphical Abstract] the cell. Thus, NKA must function continually. Principal routes for ATP replenishment include mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and creatine kinase [CrK] activity. However, it has never been possible to measure, let alone map, this integrated, cellular homeostatic NKA activity m vivo. Active trans-membrane water cycling [AWC] promises a way to do this with (H2O)-H-1 MR. In the Graphical Abstract, the AWC system is characterized by active contributions to the unidirectional rate constants for steady-state water efflux and influx, respectively, k(io)(a) and k(oi)(a).
The discovery, validation, and initial exploration of active water cycling are reviewed here. Promising applications in cancer, cardiological, and neurological MRI are covered. This initial work employed paramagnetic Gd(III) chelate contrast agents CAs. However, the significant problems associated with in vivo CA use are also reviewed.; A new analysis of water diffusion-weighted MRI DWI is presented. Preliminary results suggest a noninvasive way to measure the cell number density rho (cellsmu L), the mean cell volume V (pL), and the cellular NKA metabolic rate (MRNKA)-M-C (fmol(ATP)scell) with high spatial resolution. These crucial cell biology properties have not before been accessible in vivo. Furthermore, initial findings indicate their absolute values can be determined. (c) 2018 The Author.

N2  -  Background: Visuospatial attention is executed by the frontoparietal cortical areas of the brain. Damage to these areas can result in visual neglect. We therefore aimed to assess a combination of the greyscales task and repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to identify cortical regions involved in visuospatial attention processes. This pilot study was designed to evaluate an approach in a cohort of healthy volunteers, with the future aim of using this technique to map brain tumor patients before surgery. Ten healthy, right-handed subjects underwent rTMS mapping of 52 cortical spots in both hemispheres. The greyscales task was presented tachistoscopically and was time-locked to rTMS pulses. The task pictures showed pairs of horizontal rectangles shaded continuously from black at one end to white at the other, mirror-reversed. On each picture the subject was asked to report which of the two greyscales appeared darker overall. The responses were categorized into "leftward" and "rightward," depending on whether the subject had chosen the rectangle with the darker end on the left or the right. rTMS applied to cortical areas involved in visuospatial attention is supposed to affect lateral shifts in spatial bias. These shifts result in an altered performance on the greyscales task compared to the baseline performance without rTMS stimulation.
Results: In baseline conditions, 910 subjects showed classic pseudoneglect to the left. Leftward effects also occurred more often in mapping conditions. Yet, calculated rightward deviations were strikingly greater in magnitude (p < 0.0001). Overall, the right hemisphere was found to be more suggestible than the left hemisphere. Both rightward and leftward deviation scores were higher for the rTMS of this brain side (p < 0.0001). Right hemispheric distributions accord well with current models of visuospatial attention (Corbetta et al. Nat Neurosci 8(11): 1603-1610, 2005). We observed leftward deviations triggered by rTMS within superior frontal and posterior parietal areas and rightward deviations within inferior frontal areas and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ).; Conclusion: The greyscales task, in combination with rTMS, yields encouraging results in the examination of the visuospatial attention function. Future clinical implications should be evaluated.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Although the right prefrontal region is regarded as a silent area, chronic deficits of the executive function, including working memory (WM), could occur after resection of a right prefrontal glioma. This may be overlooked by postoperative standard examinations, and the disabilities could affect the patient's professional life. The right prefrontal region is a part of the frontoparietal network and is subserved by the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); however, the role of the SLF in spatial WM is unclear. This study investigated a persistent spatial WM deficit in patients who underwent right prefrontal glioma resection, and evaluated the relationship between the spatial WM deficit and the SLF.
METHODS Spatial WM was examined in 24 patients who underwent prefrontal glioma resection (right, n = 14; left, n = 10) and in 14 healthy volunteers using a spatial 2 -back task during the long-term postoperative period. The neural correlates of spatial WM were evaluated using lesion mapping and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. In addition, the spatial 2 -back task was performed during surgery under direct subcortical electrical stimulation in 2 patients with right prefrontal gliomas.; RESULTS Patients with a right prefrontal lesion had a significant chronic spatial WM deficit. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analysis revealed a significant correlation between spatial WM deficit and the region that overlapped the first and second segments of the SLF (SLF I and SLF II). Two patients underwent awake surgery and had difficulties providing the correct responses in the spatial 2 -back task with direct subcortical electrical stimulation on the SLF I, which was preserved and confirmed by postoperative diffusion tensor imaging tractography. These patients exhibited no spatial WM deficits during the postoperative immediate and long-term periods.; CONCLUSIONS Spatial WM deficits may persist in patients who undergo resection of the tumor located in the right prefrontal brain parenchyma. Injury to the dorsal frontoparietal subcortical white matter pathway, i.e., the SLF I or SLF I and II, could play a causal role in this chronic deficit. A persistent spatial WM deficit, without motor and language deficits, could affect the professional life of the patient. In such cases, awake surgery would be useful to detect the spatial WM network with appropriate task during tumor exploration.

N2  -  Acute multiple infarcts in multiple cerebral circulations (AMIMC) are thought to suggest the presence of cardioembolic sources or systemic hypercoagulopathy. However, the mechanism and the simultaneous occurrence of AMIMC are not well known. We reviewed 685 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 48 hours of onset. AMIMC was defined as multiple acute DWI lesions distributed in more than one cerebral circulation (i.e., 2 anterior and I posterior circulations). Signal intensities on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps corresponding to acute DWI lesions were classified as 'low', 'iso-' or 'high' signals. Blood markers obtained within 24 hours after admission were compared between patients with and without AMIMC. Sixty-seven (9.8%) patients had AMIMC. Frequency of cardioembolism in AMIMC patients was only 29.9% (20/67), which was not different from non-AMIMC patients (21.7%, p = 0.16). Large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) or small-vessel occlusion (SVO) in multiple circulations or combined LAA and SVO were identified in 34.3% (23/ 67) of AMIMC patients, although pure LAA and pure SVO were less frequent than in non-AMIMC patients. ADC signals were purely 'low' in 38 (56.7%) and 'mixed' (low with iso- or high) in 29 (43.3%). Cardioembolism tended to be associated with 'low' ADC signals (75.0%) compared with other stroke mechanisms (48.9%; p = 0.062). C-reactive protein was higher in AMIMC than in non-AMIMC patients (p = 0.009). Stroke mechanisms responsible for AMIMC are heterogeneous. ADC findings suggest that AMIMC commonly occur stepwise and may be useful in determining stroke mechanism. Systemic inflammation may be associated with the pathogenesis of AMIMC.

N2  -  A 3-year-old boy with Lowe syndrome had bilateral periatrial hyperintense lesions intermixed with small cyst-like changes in the periatial regions of the deep white matter at MR imaging. Proton MR spectroscopy revealed prominent myoinositol peaks suggesting the presence of gliosis. b=1000s/mm(2) images of diffusion MR imaging were negative for the periatrial lesions. ADC maps, however, revealed high ADC values (1.76, and 1.66x10(-3)mm(2)/s), compared to the normal brain parenchyma (0.81x10(-3)mm(2)/s). These diffusion MR imaging findings likely represented gliosis.

N2  -  Objective: The external carotid artery (ECA) is inadvertently occluded during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The importance of ECA occlusion has been emphasized as a loss of extracranial to intracranial collaterals, a source of chronic embolization, or a site for extended thrombosis during wound closure. This study aimed to determine whether ECA occlusion that inadvertently developed during endarterectomy and that was eventually detected using blood flow measurement of the ECA after declamping of all carotid arteries is a risk factor for development of new postoperative ischemic lesions at declamping of the ECA and common carotid artery (CCA) while clamping the internal carotid artery (ICA). This study also aimed to determine whether intraoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring predicts the risk for development of such lesions.
Methods: This was a prospective observational study that included patients undergoing CEA for severe stenosis ($ 70%) of the cervical ICA. When blood flow through the ECA measured using an electromagnetic flow meter decreased rapidly on clamping of only the ECA before carotid clamping for endarterectomy and was not changed by clamping of only the ECA after carotid declamping following endarterectomy, the patient was determined to have developed ECA occlusion. These patients underwent additional endarterectomy for the ECA. TCD monitoring in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery was also performed throughout surgery to identify microembolic signals (MESs). Brain magnetic resonance diffusion - weighted imaging (DWI) was performed before and after surgery.; Results: There were 104 patients enrolled in the study. Eight patients developed ECA occlusion during surgery. The incidence of intraoperative ECA occlusion was significantly higher in patients without MESs at the phase of ECA and CCA declamping (812 67%) than in those with MESs (092 0%; P <.0001). Six patients exhibited new postoperative ischemic lesions on DWI. The incidence of intraoperative ECA occlusion (P <.0001) and the absence of MESs at declamping of the ECA and CCA while clamping the ICA (P <. 0001) were significantly higher in patients with development of new postoperative ischemic lesions on DWI than in those without. Sensitivity and specificity for the absence of MESs at declamping of the ECA and CCA while clamping the ICA for predicting development of new postoperative ischemic lesions on DWI were 100% (66) and 94% (9298), respectively.; Conclusions: ECA occlusion at declamping of the ECA and CCA while clamping the ICA during CEA is a risk factor for development of new postoperative ischemic lesions. Intraoperative TCD monitoring accurately predicts the risk for development of such lesions.

N2  -  A 32-year-old pregnant woman developed a progressive right sixth cranial nerve palsy as an isolated finding. Brain MRI disclosed a discrete lobulated lesion centered in the right Meckel's cave with intermediate signal on T1, high signal on T2, and diffusion characteristics similar to those of cerebrospinal fluid on apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. The initial radiologic diagnosis was schwannoma or meningioma. No intervention occurred. Shortly after cesarean delivery, the abduction deficit began to lessen spontaneously. One month later, the abduction deficit had further improved; 7 months later it had completely resolved. Repeat MRI after delivery failed to disclose the lesion, which was now interpreted as consistent with an arachnoid cyst arising within Meckel's cave. Twenty-one similar cases of Meckel's cave arachnoid cyst or meningocele have been reported, 7 found incidentally and 14 causing symptoms, 2 of which produced ipsilateral sixth cranial nerve palsies. All previously reported symptomatic patients were treated surgically. This is the first report of an arachnoid cyst arising from Meckel's cave in pregnancy and having spontaneous resolution.

N2  -  T2-hyperintense lesions are the key imaging marker of multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies have shown that the white matter surrounding such lesions is often also affected by MS. Our aim was to develop a new method to visualize and quantify the extent of white matter tissue changes in MS based on relaxometry properties. We applied a fast, multi-parametric quantitative MRI approach and used a multi-component MR Fingerprinting (MC-MRF) analysis. We assessed the differences in the MRF component representing prolongedrelaxation time between patients with MS and controls and studied the relation between this component's volume and structural white matter damage identified on FLAIR MRI scans in patients with MS. A total of 48 MS patients at two different sites and 12 healthy controls were scanned with FLAIR and MRF-EPI MRI scans. MRF scans were analyzed with a joint-sparsity multi-component analysis to obtain magnetization fraction maps of different components, representing tissues such as myelin water, white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. In the MS patients, an additional component was identified with increased transverse relaxation times compared to the white matter, likely representing changes in free water content. Patients with MS had a higher volume of the long- component in the white matter of the brain compared to healthy controls (B (95%-CI) = 0.004 (0.0006-0.008), p = 0.02). Furthermore, this MRF component had a moderate correlation (correlation coefficient R 0.47) with visible structural white matter changes on the FLAIR scans. Also, the component was found to be more extensive compared to structural white matter changes in 73% of MS patients. In conclusion, our MRF acquisition and analysis captured white matter tissue changes in MS patients compared to controls. In patients these tissue changes were more extensive compared to visually detectable white matter changes on FLAIR scans. Our method provides a novel way to quantify the extent of white matter changes in MS patients, which is underestimated using only conventional clinical MRI scans.

N2  -  Introduction: Former studies have investigated the potential of serum biomarkers for diseases affecting the human brain. In particular the glial protein S100B, a neuro-and gliotrophin inducing plasticity, seems to be involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of psychiatric diseases such as major depression and schizophrenia. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a specific serum marker for neuronal damage. However, the specificity of these biomarkers for cell type and brain region has not been investigated in vivo until now.
Methods: We acquired two magnetic resonance imaging parameters sensitive to changes in gray and white matter (T-1-weighteddiffusion tensor imaging) and obtained serum S100B and NSE levels of 41 healthy subjects. Additionally, we analyzed whole brain gene expressions of S100B in another male cohort of three subjects using the Allen Brain Atlas. Furthermore, a female post mortal brain was investigated using double immunofluorescence labelling with oligodendrocyte markers.; Results: We show that S100B is specifically related to white matter structures, namely the corpus callosum, anterior forceps and superior longitudinal fasciculus in female subjects. This effect was observed in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity - the latest an indicator of myelin changes. Histological data confirmed a co-localization of S100B with oligodendrocyte markers in the human corpus callosum. S100B was most abundantly expressed in the corpus callosum according to the whole genome Allen Human Brain Atlas. In addition, NSE was related to gray matter structures, namely the amygdala. This effect was detected across sexes.; Conclusion: Our data demonstrates a very high S100B expression in white matter tracts, in particular in human corpus callosum. Our study is the first in vivo study validating the specificity of the glial marker S100B for the human brain, and supporting the assumption that radial diffusivity represents a myelin marker. Our results open a new perspective for future studies investigating major neuropsychiatric disorders.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuroaxonal dystrophy is a rare progressive disorder of childhood characterized by mental deterioration and seizures. The diffusion-weighted and conventional MR imaging findings are reported for six cases.
METHODS: Six patients aged 19 months to 9 years with proved neuroaxonal dystrophy (one with the infantile form, five juvenile forms) underwent imaging at 1.5 T. Echo-planar diffusion-weighted images were acquired with a trace imaging sequence in rive patients and with a three-gradient protocol (4000110) in one. Images obtained with a b value of 1000 smm(2) and corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were studied. ADCs from lesion sites and normal regions (pons and temporal and occipital lobes) were evaluated.; RESULTS: A hyperintense cerebellum (a characteristic of the disease) was evident on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images in all cases. Four patients had associated cerebral changes. Diffusion-weighted images, especially ADC maps, showed an elevated diffusion pattern in the cerebellum in the five juvenile cases (normal images at b = 1000 smm2, ADCs of 1.30-2.60 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). A restricted diffusion pattern was evident in the infantile case (hyperintensity at b = 1000 smm(2), low ADCs of 0.44-0.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)s). ADCs were normal in the pons and temporal and occipital lobes (0.64-1.00 x 10(-3) mm(2)s).; CONCLUSION. An elevated cerebellar diffusion pattern is a predominant feature of juvenile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Coexistent elevated and restricted diffusion patterns were evident in different brain regions in different forms of the disease. Dystrophic axons likely account the restricted diffusion, whereas spheroid formation (swelling) and abnormal myelination result in elevated diffusion.

N2  -  Purpose: Small-molecule inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of certain genomically defined solid cancers. Despite breakthroughs in treating systemic disease, central nervous system (CNS) metastatic progression is common, and advancements in treating CNS malignancies remain sparse. By improving drug penetration across a variably permeable blood-brain barrier and diffusion across intratumoral compartments, more uniform delivery and distribution can be achieved to enhance efficacy.
Experimental Design: Ultrasmall fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, Cornell prime dots (C' dots), were functionalized with alpha(v) integrin-binding (cRGD), or nontargeting (cRAD) peptides, and PET labels (I-124, Zr-89) to investigate the utility of dual-modality cRGD-C' dots for enhancing accumulation, distribution, and retention (ADR) in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioblastoma (mGBM). mGBMs were systemically treated with I-124-cRGD- or I-124-cRAD-C' dots and sacrificed at 3 and 96 hours, with concurrent intravital injections of FITC-dextran for mapping blood-brain barrier breakdown and the nuclear stain Hoechst. We further assessed target inhibition and ADR following attachment of dasatinib, creating nanoparticledrug conjugates (Das-NDCs). Imaging findings were confirmed with ex vivo autoradiography, fluorescence microscopy, and p-S6RP IHC.; Results: Improvements in brain tumor delivery and penetration, as well as enhancement in the ADR, were observed following administration of integrin-targeted C' dots, as compared with a nontargeted control. Furthermore, attachment of the small-molecule inhibitor, dasatinib, led to its successful drug delivery throughout mGBM, demonstrated by downstream pathway inhibition.; Conclusions: These results demonstrate that highly engineered C' dots are promising drug delivery vehicles capable of navigating the complex physiologic barriers observed in a clinically relevant brain tumor model.

N2  -  Gliomas grading is important for treatment plan; we aimed to investigate the application of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in gliomas grading, by comparing with the three-dimensional pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL). 24 patients (13 high grade gliomas and 11 low grade gliomas) underwent IVIM DWI and 3D pCASL imaging before operation; maps of fast diffusion coefficient (D*), slow diffusion coefficient (D), fractional perfusion-related volume (f), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as well as cerebral blood flow (CBF) were calculated and then coregistered to generate the corresponding parameter values. We found CBF and D* were higher in the high grade gliomas, whereas ADC, D, and f were lower (all P < 0.05). In differentiating the high from low grade gliomas, the maximum areas under the curves (AUC) of D*, CBF, and ADC were 0.857, 0.85, and 0.902, respectively. CBF was negatively correlated with f in tumor (r = -0.619, P = 0.001). ADC was positively correlated with D in both tumor and white matter (r = 0.887, P = 0.000 and r = 0.824, P = 0.000, resp.). There was no correlation between CBF and D* in both tumor and white matter (P > 0.05). IVIM DWI showed more efficiency than 3D pCASL but less validity than conventional DWI in differentiating the high from low grade gliomas.

N2  -  Multiple lines of evidence implicate striatal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of dystonia, including in DYT1, a common inherited form of the disease. The impact of striatal dysfunction on connected motor circuits and their interaction with other brain regions is poorly understood. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of the DYT1 protein torsinA from forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons creates a symptomatic model that recapitulates many characteristics of DYT1 dystonia, including the developmental onset of overt twisting movements that are responsive to antimuscarinic drugs. We performed diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI on cKO mice of either sex to define abnormalities of diffusivity and functional connectivity in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar networks. The striatum was the only region to exhibit an abnormality of diffusivity, indicating a selective microstructural deficit in cKO mice. The striatum of cKO mice exhibited widespread increases in functional connectivity with somatosensory cortex, thalamus, vermis, cerebellar cortex and nuclei, and brainstem. The current study provides the first in vivo support that direct pathological insult to forebrain torsinA in a symptomatic mouse model of DYT1 dystonia can engage genetically normal hindbrain regions into an aberrant connectivity network. These findings have important implications for the assignment of a causative region in CNS disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Stereotactic neurosurgery involves a targeted intervention based on congruence of image guidance to a reference fiducial system. This discipline has widespread applications in radiosurgery, tumor therapy, drug delivery, functional lesioning, and neuromodulation. In this article, we focused on convectionenhanced delivery to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain addressing areas of research and clinical development. We performed a robust literature review of all relevant articles highlighting current efforts and challenges of making this delivery technique more widely understood. We further described key biophysical properties of molecular transport in the extracellular space that may impact the efficacy and control of drug delivery using stereotactic methods. Understanding these principles is critical for further refinement of predictive models that can inform advances in stereotactic techniques for convectionenhanced delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain.

N2  -  Background and ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between baseline blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and the kinetics of circulating inflammatory markers in a cohort of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy.MethodsThe CoHort of Patients to Identify Biological and Imaging markerS of CardiovascUlar Outcomes in Stroke includes AIS patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy after admission MRI and undergoing a sequential assessment of circulating inflammatory markers. Baseline dynamic susceptibility perfusion MRI was postprocessed with arrival time correction to provide K2 maps reflecting BBB permeability. After coregistration of apparent diffusion coefficient and K2 maps, the 90th percentile of K2 value was extracted within baseline ischemic core and expressed as a percentage change compared with contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Population was dichotomized according to the median K2 value. Univariable and multiple variable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with increased pretreatment BBB permeability in the whole population and in patients with symptom onset ResultsIn the whole population (n = 105 patients, median K2 = 1.59), patients with an increased BBB permeability had higher serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 at H48 (p = 0.02), a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level at H48 (p = 0.01), poorer collateral status (p = 0.01), and a larger baseline ischemic core (p < 0.001). They were more likely to have hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.008), larger final lesion volume (p = 0.02), and worst neurologic outcome at 3 months (p = 0.04). The multiple variable logistic regression indicated that an increased BBB permeability was associated only with ischemic core volume (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p < 0.0001). Restricting analysis to patients with symptom onset <6 hours (n = 72, median K2 = 1.27), participants with an increased BBB permeability had higher serum levels of MMP-9 at H0 (p = 0.005), H6 (p = 0.004), H24 (p = 0.02), and H48 (p = 0.01), higher CRP levels at H48 (p = 0.02), and a larger baseline ischemic core (p < 0.0001). The multiple variable logistic analysis showed that increased BBB permeability was independently associated with higher H0 MMP-9 levels (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12-1.65, p = 0.01) and a larger ischemic core (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.59, p = 0.04).DiscussionIn AIS patients, increased BBB permeability is associated with a larger ischemic core. In the subgroup of patients with symptom onset <6 hours, increased BBB permeability is independently associated with higher H0 MMP-9 levels and a larger ischemic core.

N2  -  Simple Summary: Connectomics enables us to map whole brain networks that can be applied to operative neurosurgery to improve neuro-oncological outcomes. Damage to the superior frontal gyrus during frontal lobe surgery is thought to induce supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome in patients. However, network-based modeling may provide a more accurate cortical model of SMA syndrome, including the Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT). The aim of our study was to retrospectively assess if surgical tractography with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) decreases the likelihood of SMA syndrome. Compared to patients who underwent surgery preserving the SFG (n = 23), patients who had their FAT and SMA networks mapped through DTI and subsequently preserved were less likely to experience transient SMA syndrome. Preserving the FAT and SMA improves functional outcomes in patients following medial frontal glioma surgery and demonstrates how network-based approaches can improve surgical outcomes.
Connectomics is the use of big data to map the brain's neural infrastructure; employing such technology to improve surgical planning may improve neuro-oncological outcomes. Supplementary motor area (SMA) syndrome is a well-known complication of medial frontal lobe surgery. The 'localizationist' view posits that damage to the posteromedial bank of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) is the basis of SMA syndrome. However, surgical experience within the frontal lobe suggests that this is not entirely true. In a study on n = 45 patients undergoing frontal lobe glioma surgery, we sought to determine if a 'connectomic' or network-based approach can decrease the likelihood of SMA syndrome. The control group (n = 23) underwent surgery avoiding the posterior bank of the SFG while the treatment group (n = 22) underwent mapping of the SMA network and Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT) using network analysis and DTI tractography. Patient outcomes were assessed post operatively and in subsequent follow-ups. Fewer patients (8.3%) in the treatment group experienced transient SMA syndrome compared to the control group (47%) (p = 0.003). There was no statistically significant difference found between the occurrence of permanent SMA syndrome between control and treatment groups. We demonstrate how utilizing tractography and a network-based approach decreases the likelihood of transient SMA syndrome during medial frontal glioma surgery. We found that not transecting the FAT and the SMA system improved outcomes which may be important for functional outcomes and patient quality of life.

N2  -  The linear correlation between C-11-methionine PET and tumor cell density is not well conserved at the tumor border in glioma. A novel imaging analysis method, voxelwise F-18-FDG-C-11-methionine PET decoupling analysis (decoupling score), was evaluated to determine whether it could be used to quantitatively assess glioma cell infiltration in MRI-nonenhancing T2 hyperintense lesions. Methods: Data collection was performed in a prospective fashion. Fifty-four MRI-nonenhancing T2 hyperintense specimens were stereotactically obtained from 23 glioma patients by intraoperative navigation guidance. The decoupling score and tumor-to-normal tissue (TIN) ratio of C-11-methionine PET were calculated at each location. Correlations between the tumor cell density at these lesions, decoupling score, and TIN ratio of C-11-methionine PET were then evaluated. Results: Both the decoupling score and the T/N ratio showed a linear correlation with tumor cell density at these specimens (R-2 = 0.52 and 0.53, respectively). Use of the decoupling score (cutoff = 3.0) allowed the detection of specimens with a tumor cell density of more than 1,000/mm(2), with a sensitivity and specificity of 93.5% and 87.5%, respectively, whereas conventional C-11-methionine PET (cutoff = 1.2 in T/N ratio) was able to detect with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% and 87.5%, respectively. Reconstructed images (decoupling map) using the decoupling score enabled the visualization of glioma lesions that were difficult to visualize by C-11-methionine PET alone. Conclusion: The decoupling score showed better performance in detecting glioma cell infiltration than C-11-methionine uptake alone, thus suggesting that F-18-FDG-C-11-methionine uptake decoupling analysis is a powerful imaging modality for assessing glionia invasion.

N2  -  Objectives: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor with local recurrence after radiotherapy (RT), the most common mode of failure. Standard RT practice applies the prescription dose uniformly across tumor volume disregarding radio-logical tumor heterogeneity. We present a novel strategy using diffusion-weighted (DW-) MRI to calculate the cellular density within the gross tumor volume (GTV) in order to facilitate dose escalation to a biological target volume (BTV) to improve tumor control probability (TCP).Methods: The pre-treatment apparent diffusion coef-ficient (ADC) maps derived from DW- MRI of ten GBM patients treated with radical chemoradiotherapy were used to calculate the local cellular density based on published data. Then, a TCP model was used to calculate TCP maps from the derived cell density values. The dose was escalated using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the BTV, defined as the voxels for which the expected pre -boost TCP was in the lowest quartile of the TCP range for each patient. The SIB dose was chosen so that the TCP in the BTV increased to match the average TCP of the whole tumor.Results: By applying a SIB of between 3.60 Gy and 16.80 Gy isotoxically to the BTV, the cohort's calculated TCP increased by a mean of 8.44% (ranging from 7.19 to 16.84%). The radiation dose to organ at risk is still under their tolerance.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TCPs of GBM patients could be increased by escalating radiation doses to intratumoral locations guided by the patient's biology (i.e., cellularity), moreover offering the possi-bility for personalized RT GBM treatments.Advances in knowledge: A personalized and voxel level SIB radiotherapy method for GBM is proposed using DW- MRI, which can increase the tumor control proba-bility and maintain organ at risk dose constraints.

N2  -  Background:Poststroke fatigue (PSF) is a common symptom in stroke survivors, yet its anatomical mechanism is unclear. Our study was aimed to identify which brain lesions are related to the PSF in patients with acute stroke. MethodPatients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted from the first affiliated hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) between January 2017 and June 2020. Fatigue was scored using the Fatigue Severity Scale. All the participants were assessed by 3.0 T brain MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging. The infarct lesions were delineated manually and transformed into a standard template. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was applied to investigate the association between lesion location and the occurrence and severity of fatigue. The same analyses were carried out by flipping the left-sided lesions. Multivariate logistic regressions were applied to verify the associations. ResultsOf the 361 patients with acute stroke, 142 (39.3%) patients were diagnosed with fatigue in the acute phase and 116 (35.8%) at 6 months after the index stroke. VLSM analysis indicated clusters in the right thalamus which was significantly associated with the occurrence and severity of PSF at 6-month follow-up. In contrast, no significant cluster was found in the acute phase of stroke. The flipped analysis did not alter the results. Multivariate logistic regression verified that lesion load in the right thalamus (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.46-4.88) was an independent predictor of 6-month PSF. ConclusionOur findings indicated that lesions in the right thalamus increased the risk of fatigue symptoms 6 months poststroke.

N2  -  Objective:The intraoperative identification and preservation of optic radiations (OR) during tumor resection requires the patient to be awake. Different tasks are used. However, they do not grant the maintenance of foveal vision during all testing, limiting the ability to constantly monitor the peripheral vision and to inform about the portion of the peripheral field that is encountered. Although hemianopia can be prevented, quadrantanopia cannot be properly avoided. To overcome these limitations, we developed an intra-operative Visual field Task (iVT) to monitor the foveal vision, alerting about the likelihood of injuring the OR during task administration, and to inform about the portion of the peripheral field that is explored. Data on feasibility and efficacy in preventing visual field deficits are reported, comparing the outcome with the standard available task (Double-Picture-Naming-Task, DPNT). Methods:Patients with a temporal and/or parietal lobe tumor in close morphological relationship with the OR, or where the resection can involve the OR at any extent, without pre-operative visual-field deficits (Humphrey) were enrolled. Fifty-four patients were submitted to iVT, 38 to DPNT during awake surgery with brain mapping neurophysiological techniques. Feasibility was assessed as ease of administration, training and mapping time, and ability to alert about the loss of foveal vision. Type and location of evoked interferences were registered. Functional outcome was evaluated by manual and Humphrey test; extent of resection was recorded. Tractography was performed in a sample of patients to compare patient anatomy with intraoperative stimulation site(s). Results:The test was easy to administer and detected the loss of foveal vision in all cases. Stimulation induced visual-field interferences, detected in all patients, classified as detection or discrimination errors. Detection was mostly observed in temporal tumors, discrimination in temporo-parietal ones. Immediate visual disturbances in DPNT group were registered in 84 vs. 24% of iVT group. At 1-month Humphrey evaluation, 26% of iVT vs. 63% of DPNT had quadrantanopia (32% symptomatic); 10% of DPNT had hemianopia. EOR was similar. Detection errors were induced for stimulation of OR; discrimination also for other visual processing tract (ILF). Conclusion:iVT was feasible and sensitive to preserve the functional integrity of the OR.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores may have severe injury associated with cellular disruption that can be studied with whole-brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms. We retrospectively studied this hypothesis and correlated ADC with GCS.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients (37.81 +- 41.3 years) with TBI were enrolled: Group A had normal MR imaging findings but low GCS scores (n = 6). Group B had brain stem injury with low GCS scores (n = 6). Group C had cortical lesions with normal GCS scores (n = 5), and group D had cortical lesions with low GCS scores (n = 4). Eleven control subjects were enrolled (32.7 +- 19.2 years). Whole-brain ADC maps and histograms were generated and normalized for each subject. Mean and peak ADCs were determined. A one-sided t test was performed for each parameter. Average GCS scores and corresponding peak and mean ADCs were correlated.; RESULTS: Peak histogram values significantly differed between controls and groups A, B, and D (P < .0019, P < .00129, and P < .0148, respectively). In groups A and D, values were significantly skewed compared with control values. Mean ADC was significantly different between the control ADC and group A (P < .013) but not group C. In each group, peak ADC and GCS score were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.67).; CONCLUSION. Whole-brain peak ADCs and GCS scores are significantly correlated in patients with TBI. Although conventional MR images were normal, ADC independently indicated TBI and better represents the degree of neurologic dysfunction.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In spite of the advent of thrombolytic therapy, CT-perfusion imaging is currently not fully used for clinical decision-making and not included in published clinical guidelines for management of ischemic stroke. We investigated whether lesion volumes on cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) maps predict final infarct volume and whether all these parameters are needed for triage to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). We also investigated the effect of intravenous rtPA on affected brain by measuring salvaged tissue volume in patients receiving intravenous rtPA and in controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients receiving intravenous rtPA and 19 controls underwent CT perfusion (CTP) studies in the emergency department within 3 hours of stroke onset. Lesion volumes were measured on MTT, CBV, and CBF maps by region-of-interest analysis and were compared with follow-up CT volumes by correlation and regression analysis. The volume of salvaged tissue was determined as the difference between the initial MTT and follow-up CT lesion volumes and was compared between intravenous rtPA-treated patients and controls.; RESULTS: No significant difference between the groups was observed in lesion volume assessed from the CTP maps (P > .08). Coefficients of determination for MTT, CBF, and CBV versus follow-up CT lesion volumes were 0.3, 0.3, 0.47, with intravenous rtPA; and 0.53, 0.55, and 0.81 without intravenous rtPA. Regression of MITT on CBF lesion volumes showed codependence (R-2 = 0.98, P < .0001). Mean salvaged tissue volumes with intravenous rtPA were 21.8 +- 17.1 and 13.2 +- 13.5 mL in controls; these were significantly different by using nonparametric (P < .03) and Fisher exact tests (P < .04).; CONCLUSIONS: Within 3 hours of stroke onset, CBV lesion volume does not necessarily represent dead tissue. MITT lesion volume alone can be used to identify the upper limit of the size of abnormally perfused brain. More brain is salvaged in patients with intravenous rtPA than in controls.

N2  -  Purpose: Several chronic pain conditions may be distinguished by condition specific brain anatomical and functional abnormalities on imaging, which are suggestive of underlying disease processes. We present what is to our knowledge the first characterization of interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome associated white matter (axonal) abnormalities based on multicenter neuroimaging from the MAPP Research Network.
Materials and Methods: We assessed 34 women with interstitial cystitis bladder pain syndrome and 32 healthy controls using questionnaires on pain, mood and daily function. White matter microstructure was evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging to model directional water flow along axons or fractional anisotropy. Regions correlating with clinical parameters were further examined for gender and syndrome dependence.; Results: Women with interstitial cystitis bladder pain syndrome showed numerous white matter abnormalities that correlated with pain severity, urinary symptoms and impaired quality of life. Interstitial cystitis bladder pain syndrome was characterized by decreased fractional anisotropy in aspects of the right anterior thalamic radiation, the left forceps major and the right longitudinal fasciculus. Increased fractional anisotropy was detected in the right superior and bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculi.; Conclusions: To our knowledge we report the first characterization of brain white matter abnormalities in women with interstitial cystitis bladder pain syndrome. Regional decreases and increases in white matter integrity across multiple axonal tracts were associated with symptom severity. Given that white matter abnormalities closely correlated with hallmark symptoms of interstitial cystitisbladder pain syndrome, including bladder pain and urinary symptoms, brain anatomical alterations suggest that there are neuropathological contributions to chronic urological pelvic pain.

N2  -  Since approximately two thirds of epileptic patients are non-eligible for surgery, local axonal fiber transections might be of particular interest for them. Micrometer to millimeter wide synchrotron-generated X-ray beamlets produced by spatial fractionation of the main beam could generate such fiber disruptions non-invasively. The aim of this work was to optimize irradiation parameters for the induction of fiber transections in the rat brain white matter by exposure to such beamlets. For this purpose, we irradiated cortex and external capsule of normal rats in the antero-posterior direction with a 4 mmx4 mm array of 25 to 1000 mu m wide beamlets and entrance doses of 150 Gy to 500 Gy. Axonal fiber responses were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography; myelin fibers were examined histopathologically. Our study suggests that high radiation doses (500 Gy) are required to interrupt axons and myelin sheaths. However, a radiation dose of 500 Gy delivered by wide minibeams (1000 mu m) induced macroscopic brain damage, depicted by a massive loss of matter in fiber tractography maps. With the same radiation dose, the damage induced by thinner microbeams (50 to 100 mu m) was limited to their paths. No macroscopic necrosis was observed in the irradiated target while overt transections of myelin were detected histopathologically. Diffusivity values were found to be significantly reduced. A radiation dose <= 500 Gy associated with a beamlet size of <50 mu m did not cause visible transections, neither on diffusion maps nor on sections stained for myelin. We conclude that a peak dose of 500 Gy combined with a microbeam width of 100 mu m optimally induced axonal transections in the white matter of the brain.

N2  -  Introduction: Gamma-knife Ventral Capsulotomy (GVC) has been suggested as an efficacious treatment for a subset of patients with treatment refractory obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).Research question: The goal of this study was to investigate neural correlates of GVC and investigate the predictive value of white matter tracts that are known to be associated with clinical outcome to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).Material and methods: MR images of 8 treatment-refractory OCD patients with a minimum follow-up of 3-years who underwent GVC were used to correlate lesion characteristics with symptom improvement. This exploratory study investigated relations between differences in cortical grey matter structure and subcortical structures before and after GVC for responding and non-responding patients (n = 6). Normative diffusion MRI-based tractography was used to determine networks associated with successful lesions.Results: The mean total Y-BOCS reduction was 19.6 after three years, resulting in a response rate of 63%.The strongest correlation with symptom improvement was found for a decrease of the left ventral diencephalon volume (r =-0.83, p = 0.039). Discriminative tractography suggest streamlines connecting the prefrontal cortex with the subthalamic nucleus to be associated with clinical response. However, results could not be validated either implicating interpatient anatomical variability or reflecting the relative small sample size as a limitation.Discussion/Conclusion: Taken together, the present study highlights the efficacy of GVC in patients with treatment-refractory OCD. Our results are suggestive of GVC treatment efficacy being mediated by the involvement of a subpart of the ALIC connecting the PFC and the STN.

N2  -  Primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV) is uncommonly considered in the differential diagnosis of tumor-like lesions. This case report of tumefactive PCNSV highlights imaging features that should increase clinical suspicion for CNS vasculitis, potentially lending to earlier diagnosis and treatment. A 62-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of focal motor seizures and cortical sensory loss localizing to the right frontoparietal lobe. Noncontrast head CT was suggestive of glioma, resulting in intravenous dexamethasone administration and admission to neurosurgery. MRI appearance was atypical for glioma, with relative preservation of regional anatomy, intralesional microhemorrhage, and patchy peripheral enhancement. Despite normal CT angiogram, CSF, and serum inflammatory markers, brain biopsy was suggestive of lymphocytic vasculitis. Extensive workup for secondary causes was negative, and he was diagnosed with tumefactive PCNSV. Treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide resulted in sustained clinical and radiologic improvement. Tumefactive PCNSV is an angiogram-negative small-vessel vasculitis that has a lymphocytic histologic pattern. Tumefactive PCNSV constitutes over 10% of PCNSV cases and can be recognized by the presence of intralesional microhemorrhages, absence of diffusion restriction, and a patchy or nodular enhancement pattern. The most important mimicker is CNS lymphoma, which has a similar imaging and histologic pattern. If individuals with tumefactive PCNSV do not have a sustained immunotherapy response, repeat biopsy should be promptly performed.

N2  -  Endoscopic endonasal surgery has gained a prominent role in the management of complex skull base tumors. It allows the resection of a large group of benign and malignant lesions through a natural anatomical extra-cranial pathway, represented by the nasal cavities, avoiding brain retraction and neurovascular manipulation. This is reflected by the patients' prompt clinical recovery and the low risk of permanent neurological sequelae, representing the main caveat of conventional skull base surgery. This surgery must be tailored to each specific case, considering its features and relationship with surrounding neural structures, mostly based on preoperative neuroimaging. Advanced MRI techniques, such as tractography, have been rarely adopted in skull base surgery due to technical issues: lengthy and complicated processes to generate reliable reconstructions for inclusion in the neuronavigation system.
This paper aims to present the protocol implemented in the institution and highlights the synergistic collaboration and teamwork between neurosurgeons and the neuroimaging team (neurologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, physicists, and bioengineers) with the final goal of selecting the optimal treatment for each patient, improving the surgical results and pursuing the advancement of personalized medicine in this field.

N2  -  Brain awake surgery with cognitive monitoring for tumor removal has become a standard of treatment for functional purpose. Yet, little attention has been given to patients' interpretation and awareness of their own responses to selected cognitive tasks during direct electrostimulation (DES). We aim to report disruptions of self-evaluative processing evoked by DES during awake surgery. We further investigate cortico-subcortical structures involved in self-assessment process and report the use of an intraoperative self-assessment tool, the self-confidence index (SCI). Seventy-two patients who had undergone awake brain tumor resections were selected. Inclusion criteria were the occurrence of a DES-induced disruption of an ongoing task followed by patient's failure to remember or criticize these impairments, or a dissociation between patient's responses to an ongoing task and patient's SCI. Disruptions of self-evaluation were frequently associated with semantic disorders and critical sites were mostly found along the left/right ventral semantic streams. Disconnectome analyses generated from a tractography-based atlas confirmed the high probability of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus to be transitory 'disconnected'. These findings suggest that white matters pathways belonging to the ventral semantic stream may be critically involved in human self-evaluative processing. Finally, the authors discuss the implementation of the SCI task during multimodal intraoperative monitoring.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW

N2  -  As a result of their presumed benign natural history, cerebral capillary telangiectasias (CCTs) are infrequently addressed in the neurosurgical literature. We performed a comprehensive review of CCTs via the PubMed database to synthesize overall epidemiological, radiographic, natural history, and treatment results. Across ten series with 203 patients, mean age was 47, and 45 % were male [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.30-0.65]. Notably, 78 % of CCTs were in the pons (95 % CI, 0.58-1.0). Six percent of CCTs were symptomatic. Across five radiographic series, all lesions enhanced after gadolinium, and all were hypointense on gradient echo sequences. Thirty-three percent were hypointense on T1-weighted pre-contrast imaging (95 % CI, 0.2-0.51), 49 % were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (95 % CI, 0.31-0.72), and 74 % were hypointense on diffusion-weighted imaging (95 % CI, 0.5-1.0). Notably, 37 % were associated with a prominent draining vein (95 % CI, 0.21-0.6), and 11 % with a developmental venous anomaly (95 % CI, 0.04-0.25). Across four observational studies with 47 patients, there was no observed change in lesion morphology or hemorrhage in 65.7 patient-years of follow-up. Although the vast majority of CCTs are managed conservatively, we found ten cases of patients treated with surgical excision. We confirm that CCTs are a benevolent entity with a predilection for the pons. They have distinctive radiographic features including their lack of mass effect, consistent enhancement on T1-weighted sequences and hypointensity on gradient echo sequences, and common isointensity on pre-contrast T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Management for these lesions has been nonoperative in almost all cases.

N2  -  Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a network disorder of the brain. Network disorders predominately involve dysregulation of hippocampal function caused by neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the relationship between the macro- and microscopic changes in specific brain regions is uncertain. In this study, the pattern of brain atrophy in patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) was investigated using volumetry, and microscopic changes in specific lesions were observed to examine the anatomical correspondence with specific target lesions using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with statistical parametric mapping (SPM). This retrospective cross-sectional study enrolled 17 patients with TLE and HS. We manually measured the volumes of the hippocampus (HC), amygdala (AMG), entorhinal cortex, fornix, and thalamus (TH) bilaterally. The mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy of each patient were then quantified and analyzed by a voxel-based statistical correlation method using SPM8. In right TLE with HS, there was no evidence of any abnormal diffusion properties associated with the volume reduction in specific brain regions. In left TLE with HS, there were significant changes in the volumes of the AMG, HC, and TH. Despite the small sample size, these differences in conditions were considered meaningful. Chronic left TLE with HS might cause structural changes in the AMG, HC, and TH, unlike right TLE with HS.

N2  -  Background: Tumor location is important for surgical decision making. Particular attention is paid to regions that contain sensorimotor and language functions, but it is unknown if these are the most important regions from the patients' perspective.
Objective: To develop an atlas for depicting and assessing the potential importance of tumor location for perioperative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. Methods: Patient-reported HRQoL data and semi-automatically segmented preoperative 3D MRI-images were combined in 170 patients. The images were registered to a standardized space where the individual tumors were given the values and color intensity of the corresponding HRQoL. Descriptive brain maps of HRQoL, defined quantitative analyses, and voxel-based lesion symptom mapping comparing patients with tumors in different locations were made.; Results: There was no statistical difference in overall perioperative HRQoL between patients with tumors located in left or right hemisphere, between patients with tumors in different lobes, or between patients with tumors located in non-eloquent, near eloquent, or eloquent areas. Patients with tumors involving the internal capsule, and patients with preoperative motor symptoms and postoperative motor deficits, reported significantly worse overall HRQoL-scores.; Conclusions: The impact of anatomical tumor location on overall perioperative HRQoL seems less than frequently believed, and the distinction between critical and less critical brain regions seems more unclear according to the patients than perhaps when judged by physicians. However, worse HRQoL was found in patients with tumors in motor-related regions, indicating that these areas are crucial also from the patients' perspective.

N2  -  Objective: We examined the feasibility of using cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) to monitor the major cortical white matter tract involved in language, the arcuate fasciculus (AF), during surgery under general anaesthesia.
Methods: We prospectively recruited nine patients undergoing surgery for lesions in the left peri-sylvian cortex, for whom awake surgery was not indicated. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) tractography was used to localise frontal and temporal AF terminations, which guided intraoperative cortical strip placement.; Results: CCEPs were successfully evoked in 59 patients, showing a positive potential (P1) at 12 ms and a negative component (N1) at 21 ms when stimulating from the frontal lobe and recording in the temporal lobe. CCEP responses peaked in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. No CCEPs were evoked when stimulating temporal sites and recording from frontal contacts.; Conclusion: For the first time, we show that CCEPs can be evoked from the peri-sylvian cortices also in adult patients who are not candidates for awake procedures. Our results are akin to those described in the awake setting and suggest the recorded activity is conveyed by the arcuate fasciculus.; Significance: This intraoperative approach may have promising implications in reducing deficits in patients that require surgery in language areas under general anesthesia.

N2  -  Gradient Echo Plural Contrast Imaging (GEPCI) is a post processing technique that, based on a widely available multiple gradient echo sequence, allows simultaneous generation of naturally co-registered images with various contrasts: T1 weighted, R2* = 1/T2* maps and frequency (f) maps. Herein, we present results demonstrating the capability of GEPCI technique to generate image sets with additional contrast characteristics obtained by combing the information from these three basic contrast maps. Specifically, we report its ability to generate GEPCI-susceptibility weighted images (GEPCI-SWI) with improved SWI contrast that is free of T1 weighting and RF inhomogeneities; GEPCI-SWI-like images with the contrast similar to original SWI; T1f images that offer superior GM/WM matter contrast obtained by combining the GEPCI T1 and frequency map data; Fluid Suppressed T2* (FST2*) images that utilize GEPCI T1 data to suppress CSF signal in T2* maps and provide contrast similar to FLAIR 12 weighted images; and T2*-SWI images that combine SWI contrast with quantitative T2* map and offer advantages of visualizing venous structure with hyperintense T2* lesions (e.g. MS lesions). To analyze GEPCI images we use an improved algorithm for combining data from multi-channel RF coils and a method for unwrapping phase/frequency maps that takes advantage of the information on phase evolution as a function of gradient echo time in GEPCI echo train.

N2  -  Tests of verbal fluency have been widely used to assess the cognitive functioning of persons, and are typically classified into two categories (semantic and phonological fluency). While widely-distributed divergent and convergent brain regions have been found to be involved in semantic and phonological fluency, the anatomical connectivity underlying the fluency is not well understood. The present study aims to construct a comprehensive white-matter network associated with semantic and phonological fluency by investigating the relationship between the integrity of 22 major tracts in the whole brain and semantic fluency (measured by 3 cues) and phonological fluency (measured by 2 cues) in a group of 51 stroke patients. We found five left-lateralized tracts including the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) were significantly correlated with the scores of both semantic and phonological fluencies. These effects persisted even when we rifled out the influence of potential confounding factors (e.g., total lesion volume). Moreover, the damage to the first three tracts caused additional impairments in the semantic compared to the phonological fluency. These findings reveal the white matter neuroanatomical connectivity underlying semantic and phonological fluency, and deepen the understanding of the neural network of verbal fluency.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment-induced white matter (WM) injury in medulloblastoma survivors, as manifested by deterioration of cognitive function, is prevalent. However, no reliable imaging method exists for early detection and quantification. Our goal was to determine whether anisotropy of WM is reduced in medulloblastoma survivors and whether fractional anisotropy (FA) can be used as an index for evaluation of treatment-induced WM injury.
METHODS: We evaluated nine medulloblastoma survivors treated with surgery, cranial irradiation, and chemotherapy by use of diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging and compared FA findings in selected WM sites (cerebellar hemispheres, pons, medulla oblongata, frontal periventricular WM, parietal periventricular WM, and corona radiata) with those of healthy age-matched control subjects. FA maps were compared with conventional T2-weighted images. FA was also compared with age at treatment, time interval since treatment, and deterioration of school performance. The two-tailed paired t test was used to determine statistical significance (P <.05).; RESULTS: Significant reduction of FA (P <.05) was seen in all anatomic sites in the patient group compared with FA in control subjects, except in the frontal periventricular WM, even in areas with normal appearance on T2-weighted images. FA reduction ranged from 12.4-19% (mean, 16.5%). Compared with control subjects, posterior fossa and supratentorial WM FA in patients were reduced by 14.6% (SD 1.9%) and 18.4% (SD 0.55%), respectively (P = .029). Reduction of supratentorial WM FA correlated with younger age at treatment (< 5 years), longer interval since treatment (> 5 years), and deterioration of school performance.; CONCLUSION. DT imaging and use of the index FA is potentially useful for early detection and monitoring of treatment-induced WM injury in children with medulloblastoma.

N2  -  State-of-the art algorithms for deformable image registration are based on the minimization of an image similarity functional that is regularized by adding a penalty term on the deformation map. The penalty function typically represents a smoothness regularization. In this article, we use a constrained optimization formulation in which the image similarity functional is coupled to a biophysical model. This formulation is pertinent when the data have been generated by imaging tissue that undergoes deformations due to an actual biophysical phenomenon. Such is the case of coregistering tumor-bearing brain images from the same individual. We present an approximate model that couples tumor growth with the mechanical deformations of the surrounding brain tissue. We consider primary brain tumors-in particular, gliomas. Glioma growth is modeled by a reaction-advection-diffusion PDE, with a two-way coupling with the underlying tissue elastic deformation. Tumor bulk, infiltration, and subsequent mass effects are not regarded separately but are captured by the model itself in the course of its evolution. Our formulation allows for updating the tumor diffusion coefficient following structural displacements caused by tumor growth/infiltration. Our forward problem implementation builds on the PETSc library of Argonne National Laboratory. Our reformulation results in a very small parameter space, and we use the derivative-free optimization library APPSPACK of Sandia National Laboratories. We test the forward model and the optimization framework by using landmark-based similarity functions and by applying it to brain tumor data from clinical and animal studies. State-of-the-art registration algorithms fail in such problems due to excessive deformations. We compare our results with previous work in our group, and we observed up to 50% improvement in landmark deformation prediction. We present preliminary validation results in which we were able to reconstruct deformation fields using four degrees of freedom. Our study demonstrates the validity of our formulation and points to the need for richer datasets and fast optimization algorithms.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE The dominant inferior parietal lobule (IPL) contains cortical and subcortical regions essential for language. Although resection of IPL tumors could result in language deficits, little is known about the likelihood of postoperative language morbidity or the risk factors predisposing to this outcome.
METHODS The authors retrospectively examined a series of patients who underwent resections of gliomas from the dominant IPL. Postoperative language outcomes were characterized across the patient population. To identify factors associated with postoperative language morbidity, the authors then compared features between those patients who experienced postoperative deficits and those who experienced no postoperative language dysfunction.; RESULTS Twenty-four patients were identified for analysis. Long-term language deficits occurred in 29.2% of patients (7 of 24): 3 of these patients had experienced preoperative language deficits, whereas new long-term language deficits occurred in 4 patients (16.7%; 4 of 24). Of those patients who exhibited preoperative language deficits, 62.5% (5 of 8) experienced long-term resolution of their language deficits with surgical treatment. All patients underwent intraoperative brain mapping by direct electrical stimulation. Awake, intraoperative cortical language mapping was performed on 17 patients (70.8%). Positive cortical language sites were identified in 23.5% of these patients (4 of 17). Awake, intraoperative subcortical language mapping was performed in 8 patients (33.3%). Positive subcortical language sites were identified in 62.5% of these patients (5 of 8). Patients with positive cortical language sites exhibited a higher rate of long-term language deficits (3 of 4, 75%), compared with those who did not (1 of 13, 7.7%; p = 0.02). Although patients with positive subcortical language sites exhibited a higher rate of long-term language deficits than those who exhibited only negative sites (40.0% vs 0.0%, respectively), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.46). Additionally, patients with long-term language deficits were older than those without deficits (p < 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS In a small number of patients with preoperative language deficits, IPL glioma resection resulted in improved language function. However, in patients with intact preoperative language function, resection of IPL gliomas may result in new language deficits, especially if the tumors are diffuse, high-grade lesions. Thus, language-dominant IPL glioma resection is not risk-free, yet it is safe and its morbidity can be reduced by the use of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping.

N2  -  Semantic processing is central to cognition and is supported by widely distributed gray matter (GM) regions and white matter (WM) tracts. The exact manner in which GM regions are anatomically connected to process semantics remains unknown. We mapped the semantic anatomical network (connectome) by conducting diffusion imaging tractography in 48 healthy participants across 90 GM nodes, and correlating the integrity of each obtained WM edge and semantic performance across 80 brain-damaged patients. Fifty-three WM edges were obtained whose lower integrity associated with semantic deficits and together with their linked GM nodes constitute a semantic WM network. Graph analyses of this network revealed three structurally segregated modules that point to distinct semantic processing components and identified network hubs and connectors that are central in the communication across the subnetworks. Together, our results provide an anatomical framework of human semantic network, advancing the understanding of the structural substrates supporting semantic processing.

N2  -  Purpose of review
Left visual neglect is a frequent and dramatic consequence of right hemisphere lesions. Diagnosis is important because behavioural and pharmacological treatments are available. Furthermore, neglect raises important issues concerning the brain mechanisms of consciousness, perception and attention.; Recent findings; Recent behavioural findings and new techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, direct cortical and subcortical stimulation during brain surgery, and diffusion tensor imaging tractography, have provided evidence relevant to the debate concerning the functional mechanisms and the anatomical bases of neglect.; Summary; Several component deficits appear to interact in producing different forms of neglect. Rather than lesions at single cortical levels, dysfunction of large-scale brain networks, often induced by white matter disconnection, may constitute the crucial antecedent of neglect signs.

N2  -  Purpose: To test the feasibility of using quantitative transport mapping (QTM) method, which is based on the inversion of transport equation using spatial deconvolution without any arterial input function, for automatically postprocessing dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to differentiate malignant and benign breast tumors.
Materials and methods: Breast DCE-MRI data with biopsy confirmed malignant (n = 13) and benign tumors (n = 13) was used to assess QTM velocity (vertical bar u vertical bar) and diffusion coefficient (D), volume transfer constant (K-trans), volume fraction of extravascular extracellular space (V-e) from kinetics method, and traditional enhancement curve characteristics (ECC: amplitude A, wash-in rate alpha, wash-out rate , beta). A Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed to assess the diagnostic performance of these parameters for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors.; Results: Between malignant and benign tumors, there was a significant difference in vertical bar u vertical bar and K-trans, (p = 0.0066, 0.0274, respectively), but not in D, V-e, A, alpha and , beta (p = 0.1119, 0.2382, 0.4418,0.2592 and 0.9591, respectively). ROC area-under-the-curve was 0.82, 0.75 (95% confidence level 0.60-0.95, 0.51-0.90) for vertical bar u vertical bar and K-trans respectively.; Conclusion: QTM postprocesses DCE-MRI automatically through deconvolution in space and time to solve the inverse problem of the transport equation. Comparing with traditional kinetics method and ECC, QTM method showed better diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant breast tumors in this study.

N2  -  Left hemispheric cerebral stroke can cause apraxia, a motor cognitive disorder characterized by deficits of higher-order motor skills such as the failure to accurately produce meaningful gestures. This disorder provides unique insights into the anatomical and cognitive architecture of the human praxis system. The present study aimed to map the structural brain network that is damaged in apraxia. We assessed the ability to perform meaningful gestures with the hand in 101 patients with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Structural white matter fibre damage was directly assessed by diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy mapping. We used multivariate topographical inference on tract-based fractional anisotropy topographies to identify white matter disconnection associated with apraxia. We found relevant pathological white matter alterations in a densely connected fronto-temporo-parietal network of short and long association fibres. Hence, the findings suggest that heterogeneous topographical results in previous lesion mapping studies might not only result from differences in study design, but also from the general methodological limitations of univariate topographical mapping in uncovering the structural praxis network. A striking role of middle and superior temporal lobe disconnection, including temporo-temporal short association fibres, was found, suggesting strong involvement of the temporal lobe in the praxis network. Further, the results stressed the importance of subcortical disconnections for the emergence of apractic symptoms. Our study provides a fine-grain view into the structural connectivity of the human praxis network and suggests a potential value of disconnection measures in the clinical prediction of behavioural post-stroke outcome.
Rosenzopf et al. mapped white matter disconnection underlying limb apraxia and found a white matter network including inferior frontal and parietal, middle and superior temporal and precentral and subcortical areas to be involved in deficits in the production of communicative gestures.

N2  -  Objectives Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are infrequently reported in cats. To date, clinical characteristics, including lesion localisation and MRI findings, have only been reported in two cats. The aim of the current study is to document MRI findings in cats presenting with CVAs over an 11 year period. Cases were reviewed according to initial clinical presentation, subsequent physical and neurological findings, predisposing systemic disease and short- and long-term (when available) outcome with a view to identifying any typical pattern in disease occurrence.
Methods Patient records of cats presenting to a single referral centre from January 2005 to September 2016 with acute onset, non-progressive (after 24 h) intracranial signs compatible with a CVA and where an MRI was performed within 72 h were retrospectively reviewed.; Results Nine cats met the inclusion criteria. All cats had ischaemic CVAs (presumptively diagnosed in eight cats and confirmed in one cat following post-mortem examination). No cases of haemorrhagic CVAs were identified. Four cats presented with territorial infarcts that were confined to the territory of the rostral or caudal cerebellar arteries (n = 4). Lacunar infarcts were identified in five cats in the location of the cerebrum (n = 1), the thalamusmidbrain (n = 2) and the medulla oblongata (n = 2). Concurrent systemic disease was identified in most (n = 89). In the present study short-term prognosis was favourable and 89 cats survived to 48 h following admission.; Conclusions and relevance CVAs in cats occur in the same vascular territories as in dogs and have similar MRI features. This study notes that the presenting cats had a high likelihood of concurrent disease (89 cases) but had a favourable short-term prognosis, if neither the clinical presentation nor concurrent disease were severe.

N2  -  Medically refractory focal epilepsy is potentially curable by surgery. This Review considers the application of recent advances in structural and functional brain imaging to increase the number of patients with epilepsy who are treated surgically, and to reduce the risk of complications arising from such intervention. Current optimal MRI of brain structure can identify previously undetectable lesions, with voxel-based and quantitative analyses further increasing the diagnostic yield. If MRI proves unremarkable, PET (with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose) and single-photon emission CT of ictal-interictal cerebral blood flow might identify the brain region that contains the epileptic focus. Magnetoencephalography plus simultaneous EEG and functional MRI can map the location of interictal epileptic discharges, thereby facilitating placement of intracranial recording electrodes to define the site of seizure onset. Functional MRI can also lateralize language and localize primary motor, somatosensory and language areas, and shows promise for predicting the effects of temporal lobe resection on memory. Tractography can visualize the main cerebral white matter tracts, thereby predicting and reducing surgery risk. Currently, displays of the optic radiation and pyramidal tracts are the most relevant for epilepsy surgery. Reliable integration of structural and functional data into surgical image-guidance systems is being pursued, and promises safer neurosurgery for epilepsy in the future.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Although tractography-guided surgery is used by many surgeons, there is controversy in the published literature as it relates to its clinical utility. Here we adopted a survey-based approach with the goal of attaining a broader view of how tractography influence preoperative planning in a sampling of practicing neurosurgeons.METHODS: Three cases were prepared where the presence of a tumor distorted the optic radiation (case 1), arcuate fasciculus (case 2), and corticospinal tract (case 3). This survey was administered at the Medtronic Cranial Consortium attended by 20 practicing neurosurgeons. To avoid commercial bias, we used both the Brainlab and Medtronic platform to compute tractography. Each partic-ipant is asked to vote on a surgical trajectory before and after seeing the tractography images, as well as whether tractography added value in validating their surgical approach.RESULTS: In the 3 cases surveyed, 16%e44% of the surgeons changed the surgical corridor selected after seeing the tractography images. The most common finding associated with a change in surgical corridor involved intersection of the surgical corridor with visualized tracts. Consistently, >80% of the surgeons surveyed felt that tractography added value in their surgical planning.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of tractography in preoperative planning varies as a function of surgeon and the tumor anatomy, with >80% of the participating surgeons believing that tractography added value in preoperative surgical planning.

N2  -  We created a volumetric template of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain, which enables localization of the cortical areas defined in the Paxinos et al. (The marmoset brain in stereotaxic coordinates. Elsevier Academic Press, Cambridge, 2012) marmoset brain atlas, as well as seven broader cortical regions (occipital, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, motor, limbic, insular), different brain compartments (white matter, gray matter, cerebro-spinal fluid including ventricular spaces), and various other structures (brain stem, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus). The template was designed from T-1-weighted MR images acquired using a 3 T MRI scanner. It was based on a single fully segmented marmoset brain image, which was transported onto the mean of 13 adult marmoset brain images using a diffeomorphic strategy that fully preserves the brain topology. In addition, we offer an automatic segmentation pipeline which fully exploits the proposed template. The segmentation pipeline was quantitatively assessed by comparing the results of manual and automated segmentations. An associated program, written in Python, can be used from a command-line interface, or used interactively as a module of the 3DSlicer software. This program can be applied to the analysis of multimodal images, to map specific cortical areas in lesions or to define the seeds for further tractography analyses.

N2  -  BackgroundIschemic stroke is one of the leading causes of human death and disability. Brain edema and peri-infarct astrocyte reactivity are crucial pathological changes, both involving aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Studies revealed that acute inhibition of AQP4 after stroke diminishes brain edema, however, its effect on peri-infarct astrocyte reactivity and the subacute outcome is unclear. And if diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could reflect the AQP4 expression patterns is uncertain. MethodsRats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and allocated randomly to TGN 020-treated and control groups. One day after stroke, brain swelling and lesion volumes of the rats were checked using T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI). Fourteen days after stroke, the rats successively underwent neurological examination, T2-WI and DWI with standard b-values and ultra-high b-values, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated correspondingly. Finally, the rats' brains were acquired and used for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and AQP4 immunoreactive analysis. ResultsAt 1 day after stroke, the TGN-020-treated animals exhibited reduced brain swelling and lesion volumes compared with those in the control group. At 14 days after stroke, the TGN-020-treated animals showed fewer neurological function deficits and smaller lesion volumes. In the peri-infarct region, the control group showed evident astrogliosis and AQP4 depolarization, which were reduced significantly in the TGN-020 group. In addition, the ultra-high b-values of ADC (ADCuh) in the peri-infarct region of the TGN-020 group was higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that peri-infarct AQP4 polarization correlated negatively with astrogliosis extent, and ADCuh correlated positively with AQP4 polarization. ConclusionWe found that acutely inhibiting AQP4 using TGN-020 promoted neurological recovery by diminishing brain edema at the early stage and attenuating peri-infarct astrogliosis and AQP4 depolarization at the subacute stage after stroke. Moreover, ADCuh could reflect the AQP4 polarization.

N2  -  Objective: To assess the utility of multiphasic perfusion CT in the prediction of final infarct volume, and the relationship between lesion volume revealed by CT imaging and clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients who have not undergone thrombolytic therapy.
Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients underwent multiphasic perfusion CT within six hours of stroke onset. After baseline unenhanced helical CT scanning, contrast-enhanced CT scans were obtained 20, 34, 48, and 62 secs after the injection of 90 mL contrast medium at a rate of 3 mLsec. CT peak and total perfusion maps were obtained from serial CT images, and the initial lesion volumes revealed by CT were compared with final infarct volumes and clinical scores.; Results: Overall, the lesion volumes seen on CT peak perfusion maps correlated most strongly with final infarct volumes (R-2=0.819, p<0.001, slope of regression line=1.016), but individual data showed that they were less than final infarct volume in 31.4% of patients. In those who showed early clinical improvement (n=6), final infarct volume tended to be overestimated by CT peak perfusion mapping and only on total perfusion maps was there significant correlation between lesion volume and final infarct volume (R-2=0.854, p=0.008). The lesion volumes depicted by CT maps showed moderate correlation with baseline clinical scores and clinical outcomes (R=0.445-0.706, pless than or equal to0.007).; Conclusion: CT peak perfusion maps demonstrate strong correlation between lesion volume and final infarct volume, and accurately predict final infarct volume in about two-thirds of the 35 patients, The lesion volume seen on CT maps shows moderate correlation with clinical outcome.

N2  -  The potential utility of diffusion tensor (DT) imaging in clinical practice is broad, and new applications continue to evolve as technology advances:Clinical applications of DT imaging and tractography include tissue characterization, lesion localization, and mapping of white matter tracts. DT imaging metrics are sensitive to microstructural changes associated with central nervous system disease; however, further research is needed to enhance specificity so as to facilitate more widespread clinical application. Preoperative tract mapping, with either directionally encoded color maps or tractography, provides useful information to the neurosurgeon and has been shown to improve clinical outcomes.

N2  -  Purpose: To identify statistical consensus between published studies for distribution and functional relevance of tract white matter (WM) degradation in multiple sclerosis (MS).
Materials and Methods: By systematically searching online databases, tract-based spatial statistics studies were identified that compared fractional anisotropy (FA; a marker for WM integrity) in MS patients to healthy control subjects, correlated FA in MS patients with physical disability, or correlated FA in MS patients with cognitive performance. Voxelwise meta-analysis was performed by using the Signed Differential Mapping method for each comparison. Moderating effects of mean age, mean physical disability score, imager magnet strength, lesion load, and number of diffusion directions were assessed by means of meta-regression.; Results: Meta-analysis was performed on data from 495 patients and 253 control subjects across 12 studies. MS diagnosis was significantly associated with widespread lower tract FA (nine studies; largest cluster, 4379 voxels; z = 7.1; P < .001). Greater physical disability was significantly associated with lower FA in the right posterior cingulum, left callosal splenium, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left fornix crus (six studies; 323 voxels; z = 1.7; P = .001). Impaired cognition was significantly associated with lower FA in the callosal genu, thalamus, right posterior cingulum, and fornix crus (seven studies; largest cluster, 980 voxels; z = 2.5; P < .001).; Conclusion: WM damage is widespread in MS with differential and only minimally overlapping distributions of low FA that relates to physical disability and cognitive impairment. The higher number of clusters of lower FA in relation to cognition and their higher z scores suggest that cerebral WM damage may have a greater relevance to cognitive dysfunction than physical disability in MS, and that low anterior callosal and thalamic FA have specific importance to cognitive status.

N2  -  Background: The utility of admission CT perfusion (CTP) to that of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in acute stroke was compared. Methods: We analyzed the admission CTP and DWI scans of 96 consecutive stroke patients. HT was present in 22 patients (23%). Infarct core was manually segmented on the admission DWI. We determined the: (1) hypoperfused tissue volume in the ischemic hemisphere using a range of thresholds applied to multiple different CTP parameter maps, and (2) mean relative CTP (rCTP) voxel values within both the DWI-segmented lesions and the thresholded CTP parameter maps. Receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC) analysis and multivariate regression were used to evaluate the test characteristics of each set of volumes and mean rCTP parameter values as predictors of HT. Results: The hypoperfused tissue volumes with either relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) <0.48 (AUC = 0.73), or relative mean transit time (rMTT) >1.3 (AUC = 0.70), had similar accuracy to the DWI-segmented core volume (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.2 and p = 0.1, respectively) as predictors of HT. The mean rMTT voxel values within the rMTT >1.3 segmented lesion (AUC = 0.71) had similar accuracy to the mean rMTT voxel values ( AUC = 0.65, p = 0.24) and mean rCBF voxel values (AUC = 0.64, p = 0.22) within the DWI-segmented lesion. The only independent predictors of HT were: (1) mean rMTT with rMTT >1.3, and (2) mechanical thrombectomy. Conclusion: Admission CTP-based hypoperfused tissue volumes and thresholded mean voxel values are markers of HT in acute stroke, with similar accuracy to DWI. This could be of value when MRI cannot be obtained. Copyright (c) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  -  The computerized process of reconstructing white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is often referred to as tractography. Tractography is nowadays central in structural connectivity since it is the only non-invasive technique to obtain information about brain wiring. Most publicly available tractography techniques and most studies are based on a fixed set of tractography parameters. However, the scale and curvature of fiber bundles can vary from region to region in the brain. Therefore, depending on the area of interest or subject (e.g., healthy control vs. tumor patient), optimal tracking parameters can be dramatically different. As a result, a slight change in tracking parameters may return different connectivity profiles and complicate the interpretation of the results. Having access to tractography parameters can thus be advantageous, as it will help in better isolating those which are sensitive to certain streamline features and potentially converge on optimal settings which are area-specific. In this work, we propose a real-time fiber tracking (RTT) tool which can instantaneously compute and display streamlines. To achieve such real-time performance, we propose a novel evolution equation based on the upsampled principal directions, also called peaks, extracted at each voxel of the dMRI dataset. The technique runs on a single Computer Processing Unit (CPU) without the need for Graphical Unit Processing (GPU) programming. We qualitatively illustrate and quantitatively evaluate our novel multi-peak RTT technique on phantom and human datasets in comparison with the state of the art offline tractography from MRtrix, which is robust to fiber crossings. Finally, we show how our RTT tool facilitates neurosurgical planning and allows one to find fibers that infiltrate tumor areas, otherwise missing when using the standard default tracking parameters.

N2  -  Background To achieve maximal resection with minimal risk of postoperative neurologic morbidity, different neurosurgical adjuncts are being used during low-grade glioma (LGG) surgery.
Objectives To investigate the effect of pre- and intraoperative adjuncts on the extent of resection (EOR) of hemispheric LGGs.; Methods Medical records were reviewed to identify patients of any sex, >= 18 years of age, who underwent LGG surgery at X Hospital between January 2005 and July 2013. Patients were divided into eight subgroups based on the use of various combinations of a neuronavigation system alone (NN), functional MRI-diffusion tensor imaging (fMRI-DTI) guided neuronavigation (FD), intraoperative MRI (MR), and direct electrical stimulation (DES). Initial and residual tumors were measured, and mean EOR was compared between groups.; Results Of all 128 patients, gross total resection was achieved in 23.4%. Overall mean EOR was 81.3% +- 20.5%. Using DES in combination with fMRI-DTI (mean EOR: 86.7% +- 12.4%) on eloquent tumors improved mean EOR significantly after adjustment for potential confounders when compared with NN alone (mean EOR: 76.4% +- 25.5%; p = 0.001).; Conclusions Using DES in combination with fMRI and DTI significantly improves EOR when LGGs are located in eloquent areas compared with craniotomies in which only NN was used.

N2  -  Background Prevalence, radiological characteristics, and risk factors for peritumoral infarctions after glioma surgery are not much studied. In this study, we assessed shape, volume, and prevalence of peritumoral infarctions and investigated possible associated factors. Methods In a prospective single-center cohort study, we included all adult patients operated for diffuse gliomas from January 2007 to December 2018. Postoperative infarctions were segmented using early postoperative MRI images, and volume, shape, and location of postoperative infarctions were assessed. Heatmaps of the distribution of tumors and infarctions were created. Results MRIs from 238 (44%) of 539 operations showed restricted diffusion in relation to the operation cavity, interpreted as postoperative infarctions. Of these, 86 (36%) were rim-shaped, 103 (43%) were sector-shaped, 40 (17%) were a combination of rim- and sector-shaped, and six (3%) were remote infarctions. Median infarction volume was 1.7 cm(3) (IQR 0.7-4.3, range 0.1-67.1). Infarctions were more common if the tumor was in the temporal lobe, and the map shows more infarctions in the periventricular watershed areas. Sector-shaped infarctions were more often seen in patients with known cerebrovascular disease (47.6% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.024). There was a positive correlation between infarction volume and tumor volume (r = 0.267, p < 0.001) and infarction volume and perioperative bleeding (r = 0.176, p = 0.014). Moreover, there was a significant positive association between age and larger infarction volumes (r = 0.193, p = 0.003). Infarction rates and infarction volumes varied across individual surgeons, p = 0.037 (range 32-72%) and p = 0.026. Conclusions In the present study, peritumoral infarctions occurred in 44% after diffuse glioma operations. Infarctions were more common in patients operated for tumors in the temporal lobe but were not more common following recurrent surgeries. Sector-shaped infarctions were more common in patients with known cerebrovascular disease. Increasing age, larger tumors, and more perioperative bleeding were factors associated with infarction volumes. The risk of infarctions and infarction volumes may also be surgeon-dependent.

N2  -  Spinal cord injury triggers a series of complex biochemical alterations of nervous tissue. Up to now, such cellular events could not be studied without conventional tissue staining. The development of optical, label-free imaging techniques could provide powerful monitoring tools with the potential to be applied in vivo. In this work, we assess the ability of vibrational spectroscopy to generate contrast at molecular level between normal and altered regions in a rat model of spinal cord injury. Using tissue sections, we demonstrate that Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy are able to identify the lesion, the surrounding scar, and unharmed normal tissue, delivering insight into the biochemical events induced by the injury and allowing mapping of tissue degeneration. The FT-IR and Raman spectroscopic imaging provides the basis for fast multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy (coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, endogenous two-photon fluorescence, and second harmonic generation). The latter proves to be a fast tool for imaging of the lesion on unstained tissue samples, based on the alteration in lipid content, extracellular matrix composition, and microglia/macrophages distribution pattern. The results establish these technologies in the field of regeneration in central nervous system, with the long-term goal to extend them to intravital use, where fast and nonharmful imaging is required.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), metastatic tumors of the brain may exhibit different signal intensities (SI) depending on their histology and cellularity. The purpose of our study was to verify the hypotheses (1) that SI on DWI predict the histology of metastases and (2) that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values reflect tumor cefularity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed conventional MR images, DWI, and ADC maps of 26 metastatic brain lesions from 26 patients, 13 of whom underwent surgery after the MR examination. Two radiologists performed qualitative assessment by consensus of the SI on DWI in areas corresponding to their enhancing portions. We measured the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on T2-weighted images and normalized ADC (nADC) values, and compared them with tumor cellularity.; RESULTS: The mean SI on DWI and the CNR on T2-weighted images were significantly lower in well differentiated than in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and lesions other than adenocarcinoma. The mean nADC value was significantly higher in well differentiated than poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and lesions other than adenocarcinoma. All 3 small-cell carcinomas and 1 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma exhibited high SI on DWI. The nADC value showed a significant inverse correlation with tumor cellularity. There was no significant correlation between the CNR and tumor cellularity.; CONCLUSION: The SI on DWI may predict the histology of metastases; well differentiated adenocarcinomas tended to be hypointense, and small- and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas showed hyperintensity. Their ADC values reflect tumor cellularity.

N2  -  There is a need to identify biomarkers that predict degree of chronic speech fluency/language impairment and potential for improvement after stroke. We previously showed that the Arcuate Fasciculus lesion load (AF-LL), a combined variable of lesion site and size, predicted speech fluency in patients with chronic aphasia. In the current study, we compared lesion loads of such a structural map (i.e., AF-LL) with those of a functional map [i.e., the functional gray matter lesion load (fGM-LL)] in their ability to predict speech fluency and naming performance in a large group of patients. The fGM map was constructed from functional brain images acquired during an overt speaking task in a group of healthy elderly controls. The AF map was reconstructed from high-resolution diffusion tensor images also from a group of healthy elderly controls. In addition to these two canonical maps, a combined AF-fGM map was derived from summing fGM and AF maps. Each canonical map was overlaid with individual lesion masks of 50 chronic aphasic patients with varying degrees of impairment in speech production and fluency to calculate a functional and structural lesion load value for each patient, and to regress these values with measures of speech fluency and naming. We found that both AF-LL and fGM-LL independently predicted speech fluency and naming ability; however, AF lesion load explained most of the variance for both measures. The combined AF-fGM lesion load did not have a higher predictability than either AF-LL or fGM-LL alone. Clustering and classification methods confirmed that AF lesion load was best at stratifying patients into severe and non-severe outcome groups with 96% accuracy for speech fluency and 90% accuracy for naming. An AF-LL of greater than 4 cc was the critical threshold that determined poor fluency and naming outcomes, and constitutes the severe outcome group. Thus, surrogate markers of impairments have the potential to predict outcomes and can be used as a stratifier in experimental studies.

N2  -  Background: Glioma cells may infiltrate beyond the tumor margins revealed on conventional structural images.
Purpose: To investigate whether the presence of a glioma infiltration sign on high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can predict the prognosis of gliomas.; Study Type: Retrospective cohort.; Subjects: Fifty-two patients with gliomas (14 WHO grade II; 13 WHO grade III; 25 WHO grade IV).; Field StrengthSequence: 3.0T, including a T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1w-CE) sequence, contrast-enhanced T2flair sequence, and a DWI sequence.; Assessment: T1w-CE images and contrast-enhanced T2-flair images were used for identifying the tumor region for enhancing and nonenhancing gliomas, respectively. The glioma infiltration sign was defined as the presence of a peritumoral abnormal high signal region on DWI map, which was adjacent to the tumor region and had higher signal than surrounding areas. This sign was assessed on a high b-value DWI map with b53000 smm 2. For patients with glioma infiltration sign, DWI3000max, DWI1000max, ADC3000min, and ADC1000min were measured by drawing a region of interest over the peritumoral abnormal high signal region.; Statistical Tests: Survival analysis was conducted by using Cox regression.; Results: Glioma infiltration sign was observed in 28 (53.8%) patients. The occurrence rate of this sign was 92.0% in grade IV gliomas, 30.8% in grade III gliomas, and 7.1% in grade II gliomas. The glioma infiltration sign could independently predict both the progression-free survival (hazard ratio HR, 95% confidence interval CI 58.58 3.19-23.03, P< 0.001) and overall survival (HR, 95% CI511.90 3.41-41.55, P< 0.001) after adjustment. For patients with glioma infiltration sign, DWI3000max (P50.005) and ADC3000min (P50.008) were both independent predictors of overall survival after adjustment, while DWI1000max and ADC1000min were not. Data; Conclusion: The glioma infiltration sign on high b-value DWI is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in glioma patients. High b-value DWI might be a convenient method to detect glioma infiltration.; Level of Evidence: 3; Technical Efficacy: Stage 2

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediction of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-mutation and 1p/19q-codeletion status of World Health Organization grade ll gliomas preoperatively may assist in predicting prognosis and planning treatment strategies. Our aim was to characterize the histogram and texture analyses of apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy maps to determine IDH1-mutation and 1p/19q-codeletion status in World Health Organization grade II gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with World Health Organization grade II gliomas with known IDH1-mutation and 1p19q-codeletion status (18 IDH1 wild-type, 45 IDH1 mutant and no 1p19q codeletion, 30 IDH1-mutant and 1p19q codeleted tumors) underwent DTI. ROIs were drawn on every section of the T2-weighted images and transferred to the ADC and the fractional anisotropy maps to derive volume-based data of the entire tumor. Histogram and texture analyses were correlated with the IDH1-mutation and 1p19q-codeletion status. The predictive powers of imaging features for IDH1 wild-type tumors and 1p19q-codeletion status in IDH1-mutant subgroups were evaluated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.; RESULTS: Various histogram and texture parameters differed significantly according to IDH1-mutation and 1p19q-codeletion status. The skewness and energy of ADC, 10th and 25th percentiles, and correlation of fractional anisotropy were independent predictors of an IDH1 wild-type in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The area under the receiver operating curve for the prediction model was 0.853. The skewness and cluster shade of ADC, energy, and correlation of fractional anisotropy were independent predictors of a 1p19q codeletion in IDH1-mutant tumors in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.807.; CONCLUSIONS: Whole-tumor histogram and texture features of the ADC and fractional anisotropy maps are useful for predicting the IDH1-mutation and 1p19q-codeletion status in World Health Organization grade II gliomas.

N2  -  Sentence production involves mapping from deep structures that specify meaning and thematic roles to surface structures that specify the order and sequencing of production ready elements. We propose that the frontal aslant tract is a key pathway for sequencing complex actions with deep hierarchical structure. In the domain of language, and primarily with respect to the left FAT, we refer to this as the 'Syntagmatic Constraints On Positional Elements' (SCOPE) hypothesis. One prediction made by the SCOPE hypothesis is that disruption of the frontal aslant tract should disrupt sentence production at grammatical phrase boundaries, with no disruption of articulatory processes. We test this prediction in a patient undergoing direct electrical stimulation mapping of the frontal aslant tract during an awake craniotomy to remove a left frontal brain tumor. We found that stimulation of the left FAT prolonged inter-word durations at the start of grammatical phrases, while inter-word durations internal to noun phrases were unaffected, and there was no effect on intra-word articulatory duration. These results provide initial support for the SCOPE hypothesis, and motivate novel directions for future research to explore the functions of this recently discovered component of the language system.

N2  -  Progress in neurodevelopmental brain research has been achieved through the use of animal models. Such models not only help understanding biological changes that govern brain development, maturation and aging, but are also essential for identifying possible mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and age-related chronic disorders, and to evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human disease. Genetic relationship of rhesus monkeys to humans makes those animals a great candidate for such models. With the typical lifespan of 25 years, they undergo cognitive maturation and aging that is similar to this observed in humans. Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking white matter brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for nonhuman primates. Here, we analyze and model lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys. We report quantitative parameters (including slopes and peaks) of lifespan trajectories for 8 individual white matter tracts. We show different trajectories for cellular and extracellular microstructural imaging components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging, and discuss similarities and differences between those in humans and rhesus monkeys, the importance of our findings, and future directions for the field.
Significance Statement: Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of structural white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for rhesus monkeys. We present here results of the analysis and modeling of the lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys (age 4-27). We report and anatomically map lifespan changes related to cellular and extracellular microstructural components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we updated our previously reported case series of patients who had undergone decompressive craniectomy for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (mMCAI) (2005-2020). To the best of our knowledge, the present case series constitutes the largest reported series from a UK neurosurgical unit of decompressive craniectomy for mMCAI.
METHODS: We extracted data regarding the clinical discriminators, surgical timescales, and functional outcomes of patients.; RESULTS: A total of 67 patients had undergone decompressive craniectomy. The 30-day mortality was 17.9% (n = 12). Of the 67 patients, 31 were male (46.3%) and 36 were female (53.7%). Their mean age was 45 years (range, 16-64 years). The mean age of the survivors was 43 years (range, 16-62 years) compared with 50 years (range, 38-64 years) for those who had died. The median ictal and preoperative Glasgow coma scale score was 14 (range, 7-15) and 8 (range, 3-15), respectively. The corresponding motor scores were 6 and 5. The mean interval from ictus to neurosurgical nit admission was 18.25 hours (range, 0.5-66 hours) and from admission to decompressive craniotomy was 7.30 hours (range, 0.5-46 hours). Of the 67 patients, 63% had undergone "early" craniectomy (<48 hours from mMCAI evolution), with 89% of these patients having undergone craniectomy <24 hours after neurosurgical unit admission. The mean maximum anteroposterior craniectomy diameter was 13.01 cm (range, 10.29-15.56 cm), and mean surface area was 94.38 cm(2) (range, 74.75-132.32 cm(2)). Overall, 46% of patients had had a modified Rankin scale score of <3 (range, 0-6) from discharge to 12 months postoperatively. The median neurosurgical unit length of stay was 15 days (range, 6 hours to 365 days).; CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the present update have confirmed that local practice has remained consistent with current evidence. However, patient selection might be optimized if diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography perfusion were used at the original middle cerebral artery infarct admission.

N2  -  Patients undergoing awake surgery for resection of brain tumours in the primary motor cortex (M1) are at high risk of developing new motor deficits. Thus, use of this procedure requires consideration of several important points, including the optimal modality to localise M1 on the affected side and the overall advantages and disadvantages of the procedure. In our experience with awake surgery for 21 brain tumours located in the M1 from January 2004 through October 2008, we found that functional magnetic resonance imaging was the most reliable modality in terms of localising the M1 and that the anatomic relationship between motor tracts and brain tumours is a critical determinant of postoperative motor function. Other considerations, including potential complications of this procedure and relative efficacy and safety versus surgery under general anaesthesia for patients with brain tumours in the M1, are discussed.

N2  -  A growing number of papers have pointed out the relationship between aggressive resection of gliomas and survival prognosis. For maximum resection, the current concept of surgical decision-making is in "information-guided surgery" using multimodal intraoperative information. With this, anatomical information from intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MM) and navigation, functional information from brain mapping and monitoring, and histopathological information must all be taken into account in the new perspective for innovative minimally invasive surgical treatment of glioma. Intraoperative neurofunctional information such as neurophysiological functional monitoring takes the most important part in the process to acquire objective visual data during tumor removal and to integrate these findings as digitized data for intraoperative surgical decision-making. Moreover, the analysis of qualitative data and threshold-setting for quantitative data raise difficult issues in the interpretation and processing of each data type, such as determination of motor evoked potential (MEP) decline, underestimation in tractography, and judgments of patient response for neurofunctional mapping and monitoring during awake craniotomy. Neurofunctional diagnosis of false-positives in these situations may affect the extent of resection, while false-negatives influence intra- and postoperative complication rates. Additionally, even though the various intraoperative visualized data from multiple sources contribute significantly to the reliability of surgical decisions when the information is integrated and provided, it is not uncommon for individual pieces of information to convey opposing suggestions. Such conflicting pieces of information facilitate higher-order decision-making that is dependent on the policies of the facility and the priorities of the patient, as well as the availability of the histopathological characteristics from resected tissue.

T2  -  FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY

N2  -  BackgroundPathological brain processes may induce adaptive cortical reorganization, however, the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity that occurs in the presence of lesions in eloquent areas are not fully explained. The aim of this study was to evaluate functional compensatory cortical activations in patients with frontal brain gliomas during a phonemic fluency task and to explore correlations with cognitive performance, white matter tracts microstructural alterations, and tumor histopathological and molecular characterization. MethodsFifteen patients with frontal glioma were preoperatively investigated with an MRI study on a 3T scanner and a subgroup underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment. The hemispheric laterality index (LI) was calculated through phonemic fluency task functional MRI (fMRI) activations in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe parcellations. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for all patients and for a group of 24 matched healthy volunteers. Arcuate Fasciculus (AF) and Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT) tractography was performed using constrained spherical deconvolution diffusivity modeling and probabilistic fiber tracking. All patients were operated on with a resective aim and underwent adjuvant therapies, depending on the final diagnosis. ResultsAll patients during the phonemic fluency task fMRI showed left hemispheric dominance in temporal and parietal regions. Regarding frontal regions (i.e., frontal operculum) we found right hemispheric dominance that increases when considering only those patients with tumors located on the left side. These latter activations positively correlate with verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory, and executive functions. No correlations were found between the left frontal operculum and cognitive performance. Furthermore, patients with IDH-1 mutation and without TERT mutation, showed higher rightward frontal operculum fMRI activations and better cognitive performance in tests measuring general cognitive abilities, semantic fluency, verbal short-term memory, and executive functions. As for white matter tracts, we found left and right AF and FAT microstructural alterations in patients with, respectively, left-sided and right-side glioma compared to controls. ConclusionsCompensatory cortical activation of the corresponding region in the non-dominant hemisphere and its association with better cognitive performance and more favorable histopathological and molecular tumor characteristics shed light on the neuroplasticity mechanisms that occur in the presence of a tumor, helping to predict the rate of post-operative deficit, with the final goal of improving patients'quality of life.

N2  -  Aim. To study the frequency, safety and efficacy of perfusion computed tomography (PCT), through identification of brain tissue-at-risk, to guide intravenous thrombolysis in stroke patients with regulatory exclusion criteria (SITS-MOST and ECASS-3).
Patients and methods. We studied consecutive acute non-lacunar ischemic stroke patients. After conventional CT was Considered eligible, PCT was performed in the following circumstances: 4.5 to 6 h window, wake-up stroke or unknown time Of onset; extent early infarct signs on CT; minor or severe stroke; seizures or loss of consciousness. Intravenous 0.9 mgkg alteplase was indicated if: cerebral blood volume lesion covered < 13 of middle cerebral artery territory; mismatch > 20% between mean transit time and cerebral blood volume maps existed; and informed consent. SITS-MOST safety-efficacy parameters were used as endpoint variables.; Results. Between May 2009-April 2010, 66 hyperacute ischemic stroke patients a priori not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis underwent PCT. Indications were: > 4.5 h in 18 patients, wake up stroke or unknown onset in 25, extent infarct signs in 6, seizures at onset in 11, and minor stroke (NIHSS < 4) in 6. Twenty-nine (44%) of them finally received intravenous thrombolysis. Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation occurred in 2 (6.9%) patient and 18 (62.1%) achieved a modified Rankin scale score equal or less than 2 on day 90.; Conclusion. A high proportion of acute stroke patients with SITS-MOST and ECASS-3 exclusion criteria can be safely and efficaciously treated with intravenous thrombolysis using a PCT selection prototol. However randomized control trials will be needed to confirm our results.

N2  -  Background and purposeBaseline diffusion or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) characteristics have been shown to predict outcome related to DIPG, but the predictive value of post-radiation ADC is less well understood. ADC parametric mapping (FDM) was used to measure radiation-related changes in ADC and compared these metrics to baseline ADC in predicting progression-free survival and overall survival using a large multi-center cohort of DIPG patients (Pediatric Brain Tumor ConsortiumPBTC).Materials and methodsMR studies at baseline and post-RT in 95 DIPG patients were obtained and serial quantitative ADC parametric maps were generated from diffusion-weighted imaging based on T2/FLAIR and enhancement regions of interest (ROIs). Metrics assessed included total voxels with: increase in ADC (iADC); decrease in ADC (dADC), no change in ADC (nADC), fraction of voxels with increased ADC (fiADC), fraction of voxels with decreased ADC (fdADC), and the ratio of fiADC and fdADC (fDM Ratio).ResultsA total of 72 patients were included in the final analysis. Tumors with higher fiADC between baseline and the first RT time point showed a trend toward shorter PFS with a hazard ratio of 6.44 (CI 0.79, 52.79, p=0.083). In contrast, tumors with higher log mean ADC at baseline had longer PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (CI 0.09, 0.82, p=0.022). There was no significant association between fDM derived metrics and overall survival.ConclusionsBaseline ADC values are a stronger predictor of outcome compared to radiation related ADC changes in pediatric DIPG. We show the feasibility of employing parametric mapping techniques in multi-center studies to quantitate spatially heterogeneous treatment response in pediatric tumors, including DIPG.

N2  -  1. Eighth nerve evoked responses in central vestibular neurons (n = 146) were studied in the isolated brain stem of frogs. Ninety percent of these neurons responded with a monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) after electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral VIIIth nerve. In 5% of these neurons, the EPSP was truncated by a disynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), and in 5% of these neurons a pure disynaptic IPSP was evoked.
2. Disynaptic IPSPs superimposed upon apparently pure EPSPs were revealed by bath application of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (0.5-5 mu M) or of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.5-2 mu M). The evoked EPSP increased in most central vestibular neurons (strychnine: 15 out of 16 neurons; bicuculline 26 out of 29 neurons). At higher stimulus intensities, the evoked spike discharge increased from 2 to 3 spikes before up to 8-10 spikes per electrical pulse during the application of blocking agents. The unmasked disynaptic inhibitory component increased with stimulus intensity to a different extent in different neurons. 3. Lesion studies demonstrated that these inhibitory components were generated ipsilaterally with respect to the recording side. The disynaptic strychnine-sensitive inhibition was mediated by neurons located either in the ventral vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) or in the adjacent reticular formation. The spatial distribution of the disynaptic inhibition was investigated by simultaneous recordings of VIIIth nerve-evoked field potentials at different rostrocaudal locations of the VNC. A significant strychnine-sensitive component was detected in the middle and caudal parts but not in the rostral part of the VNC. A bicuculline-sensitive component was detected in the rostral and in the caudal parts but not in the middle part of the VNC. In view of a similar rostrocaudal distribution of glycine- or GABA-immunoreactive neurons in the VNC of frogs, our results suggest that part of the disynaptic inhibition is mediated by local interneurons with a spatially restricted projection area. 4. The monosynaptic EPSP of second-order vestibular neurons was mediated in part by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and in part by non-NMDA receptors. The relative contribution of the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSP decreased with stronger stimuli. This negative correlation could have resulted from a preferential activation of NMDA receptors via thick vestibular nerve afferent fibers. Alternatively, the activation of NMDA receptors became disfacilitated at higher stimulus intensities due to the recruitment of disynaptic inhibitory inputs. Comparison of data obtained in the presence and in the absence of these glycine and GABA(A) receptor blockers indicates a preferential activation of NMDA receptors via larger-diameter vestibular nerve afferent fibers.; 5. The kinetics of NMDA receptors (delay, rise time) activated by afferent nerve inputs were relatively fast. These fast kinetics were independent of superimposed IPSPs. The association of these receptors with large-diameter vestibular nerve afferent fibers suggests that fast NMDA receptor kinetics might be matched to the more phasic response dynamics of the large diameter vestibular afferent neurons to natural head accelerations.

N2  -  Background: Deep learning-based (DL) methods are the best-performing methods for white matter tract seg-mentation in anatomically healthy subjects. However, tract annotations are variable or absent in clinical data and manual annotations are especially difficult in patients with tumors where normal anatomy may be distorted. Direct cortical and subcortical stimulation is the gold standard ground truth to determine the cortical and sub -cortical lo-cation of motor-eloquent areas intra-operatively. Nonetheless, this technique is invasive, prolongs the surgical procedure, and may cause patient fatigue. Navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) has a well-established correlation to direct cortical stimulation for motor mapping and the added advantage of being able to be acquired pre-operatively.New method: In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using nTMS motor responses as a method to assess corticospinal tract (CST) binary masks and estimated uncertainty generated by a DL-based tract segmentation in patients with diffuse gliomas.Results: Our results show CST binary masks have a high overlap coefficient (OC) with nTMS response masks. A strong negative correlation is found between estimated uncertainty and nTMS response mask distance to the CST binary mask. Comparison with existing methods: We compare our approach (UncSeg) with the state-of-the-art TractSeg in terms of OC between the CST binary masks and nTMS response masks.Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that estimated uncertainty from UncSeg is a good measure of the agreement between the CST binary masks and nTMS response masks distance to the CST binary mask boundary.

N2  -  In the present study, we aimed to test the association between the correct function of the left ventral white matter pathways and semantic processing (dual stream models for language processing, Hickok & Poeppel, 2004), using a new set of language tasks during intraoperative electrical stimulation at white matter level. Additionally, we evaluated brain regions needed for correct performance on the different semantic tasks using lesion-symptom analyses (voxel lesion-symptom mapping and track-wise lesion analysis) in a sample of 62 candidates for the awake brain surgery. We found that electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the inferior longitudinal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi disturbed performance on semantic processing tasks. Individuals presented with significantly more semantic paraphasias during brain tumor resection than during the electrical stimulation at the cortex level. Track-wise analyses confirmed the role of these left ventral pathways in semantic processing: a significant relationship was observed between the probability of inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus disconnection/damage and the semantic matching tasks, as well as the number of semantic paraphasias in naming. Importantly, the same analyses for the total score of the Boston Naming Test confirmed significant relationships between this test score and the integrity of the inferior fronto-occipital, inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi. This was further supported by the results of VLSM analyses showing a significant relationship between BNT and the presence of lesion within left middle and inferior temporal gyri. The present findings provide new intraoperative evidence for the role of the white-matter ventral pathways in semantic processing, while at the same time emphasizing the need to include a broader assessment of semantic-conceptual aspects during the awake neurosurgical intervention. This approach will ensure better preservation of functional tissue in the tumoral vicinity and therefore substantially diminish post-surgical language impairments.

N2  -  Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is based on clinical criteria and electrophysiological tests (electromyography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation). In the search for ALS biomarkers, the role of imaging procedures is currently emphasized, especially modern MR techniques. MR procedures were performed on 15 ALS patients and a sex- and age-matched control group. The MR examinations were performed with a 1.5-T MR unit, and the protocol consisted of sagittal T1-weighed images, sagittal and axial T2-weighed images, and sagittal T2-weighed FAT SAT images followed by an axial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence of the cervical spinal cord. FA values in individual segments of the cervical spinal cord were decreased in the ALS group in comparison with the control group. After comparing FA values for anterior, posterior, and lateral corticospinal columns, the greatest difference was observed between the C2 and C5 segments. Spinal cord assessment with the use of FA measurements allows for confirmation of the motor pathways lesion in ALS patients. The method, together with clinical criteria, could be helpful in ALS diagnosis, assessment of clinical course, or even the effects of new drugs. The results also confirmed the theory of the generalized character of ALS.

N2  -  Background: Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI) has been used to differentiate the solitary metastases from high-grade glioma. However, the CBV value obtained from classical algorithm can be affected by a number of factors. Tissue Similarity Map (TSM) is a new algorithm depending solely on the signal intensity time course but does not require the use of Concentration Time Curve (CTC), which is different from the classical rCBV algorithm.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic utility of TSM based rCBV values in differentiating between high-grade gliomas and solitary metastases.; Methods: The preoperative MR PWI studies of 30 patients with a solitary cerebral neoplasm were retrospectively analyzed. All PWI data were calculated for TSM algorithm with MATLAB 7.6 (Math Works, Natick, MA). The TSM based rCBV (rCBVTSM) were measured in the parenchyma of tumor and peritumoral regions. All specimens were histopathologically categorized as high-grade gliomas or metastases and were correlated with corresponding rCBVTSM values.; Results: All PWI data could be post-processed by using the TSM post-processing software. The differences in the rCBVTSM-T between high-grade gliomas and metastases were not statistically significant (p=0.299). While the rCBVTSM-P of high-grade gliomas was higher than that of metastases (p=0.040). ROC curve analysis showed significant AUC of rCBVTSM-P for differentiating high-grade gliomas from metastases (p=0.020). The rCBVTSM-P threshold of 1.725 was found to be a significant cutoff value for high-grade gliomametastases prediction with 0.619 sensitivity and 0.889 specificity.; Conclusion: The rCBVTSM-P derived from MR PWI may be helpful in differentiating high-grade gliomas from solitary metastases.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is capable of imaging ischemia-induced changes in water protons in either animal or man, Technical developments are described that allow the routine clinical utility of DWI in a stroke setting to provide objective criteria beyond the neurological exam by which the pathophysiology of stroke can be evaluated, To date, DWI has provided unique information concerning detection and evaluation of acute, symptomatic lesions from older, chronic strokes, detection and localization of small deep infarcts and reversible ischemic neurologic deficits and transient ischemia, Clinical DWI studies suggest that the temporal behaviour of ADC can critically improve the evaluation of clinical ischemia.

N2  -  AimsEpilepsy is a common symptom in diffuse lower-grade glioma (DLGG). The specific role of white matter (WM) alteration in patients with glioma-related epilepsy (GRE) is largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the reorganization of WM tracts and changes in structural networks related to GRE. MethodsDiffusion-weighted images were collected from 70 patients with left frontal DLGG (GRE = 33, non-GRE = 37) and 41 healthy controls (HC). Tractometry with TractSeg was applied to segment tracts and quantify fractional anisotropy (FA) along each tract. Structural network was constructed using constrained spherical deconvolution and probabilistic tractography. FA and network properties were compared among three groups. ResultsCompared with HC, both GRE and non-GRE showed decreased FA in contralateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus II and arcuate fasciculus, increased nodal efficiency in contralateral nodes of frontal-parietal and limbic networks, whereas decreased degree centrality and betweenness centrality in nodes of dorsal temporal lobe and rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG). Additionally, when compared GRE with non-GRE, increased FA in contralateral corticospinal tract (CST) and lower betweenness centrality in paracentral lobule (PCL) in GRE (all p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). ConclusionThis study indicates that patients with left frontal DLGG exhibit complex WM reorganization, and the altered regions mainly concentrated in the language, frontal-parietal and limbic networks. Moreover, the preserved integrity in contralateral CST and server decreased nodal betweenness in PCL may be potential neuroimaging markers underlying the occurrence of presurgical seizures of GRE.

N2  -  In those with drug refractory focal epilepsy, MR imaging is important for identifying structural causes of seizures that may be amenable to surgical treatment. In up to 25% of potential surgical candidates, however, MRI is reported as unremarkable even when employing epilepsy specific sequences. Automated MRI classification is a desirable tool to augment the interpretation of images, especially when changes are subtle or distributed and may be missed on visual inspection. Support vector machines (SVM) have recently been described to be useful for voxel-based MR image classification. In the present study we sought to evaluate whether this method is feasible in temporal lobe epilepsy, with adequate accuracy.
We studied 38 patients with hippocampal sclerosis and unilateral (mesial) temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) (20 left) undergoing presurgical evaluation and 22 neurologically normal control subjects. 3D T1-weighted images were acquired at 3T (GE Excite), segmented into tissue classes, normalized and smoothed with SPM8. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and double echo images for T2 relaxometry were also acquired and processed. The SVM analysis was done with the libsvm software package in a leave-one-out cross-validation design and predictive accuracy was measured. Local weighting was applied by SPM F-contrast maps.; Best accuracies were achieved using the gray matter based segmentation (90-100%) and mean diffusivity (95-97%). For the three-way classification, accuracies were 88 and 93% respectively. Local weighting generally improved the accuracies except in the FA-based processing for which no effect was noted. Removing the hippocampus from the analysis, on the other hand, reduced the obtainable diagnostic indices but these were still > 90% for DTI-based methods and lateralization based on gray matter maps. These findings show that automated SVM image classification can achieve high diagnostic accuracy in mTLE and that voxel-based MRI can be used at the individual subject level. This could be helpful for screening assessments of MRI scans in patients with epilepsy and when no lesion is detected on visual evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value of f derived from IVIM technique and to correlate it with rCBV derived from DSC for the differentiation of residual/recurrent tumor from post-treatment change in patients with high-grade glioma. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent MR imaging with IVIM and DSC studies for evaluation of high-grade glioma after standard treatment were enrolled in this retrospective study. For qualitative analysis, the f and rCBV maps were interpreted as hypoperfused or hyperperfused in each parameter. Quantitative analysis was performed using ROI analysis in f and rCBV parameters. The lesions were divided into residual/recurrent tumor and post-treatment change groups. Results Nineteen patients with high-grade glioma were included. In qualitative analysis, the f-map shows higher sensitivity (100.0%) than rCBV map (92.3%), while the rCBV map shows higher specificity (100.0%) than the f-map (83.3%). In quantitative analysis, the optimal cutoff values of 1.19 for f and 1.06 for rCBV are shown to provide high diagnostic value with high sensitivity (91.7%) for both parameters but slightly higher specificity of rCBV (85.7%) than f (71.4%). The correlation between f and rCBV was good with ICC of 0.810. Conclusion The f value measured by IVIM technique, non-contrast perfusion technique, has high diagnostic performance and potential to be an alternative method to CBV measured by DSC for differentiation between residual/recurrent tumor and post-treatment change in patients with high-grade glioma.

N2  -  We studied 156 individuals with acute, right hemisphere ischemic stroke on a battery of hemispatial neglect tests to distinguish between viewer-centered and stimulus-centered neglect and MRI diffusion weighted imaging. We identified the relative contributions of age, total lesion volume, and damage to subcortical and cortical grey matter regions as well as white matter tracts to both the severity and presence of significant viewer-centered and stimulus-centered neglect, using multivariable regression tests. We found that age, volume of lesion, and percent damage to the regions of interest were each independently associated with the severity of viewer-centered neglect (r(2) = .31; p < .0001). However, only age (t = 3.20; p = .002) and percent damage to the angular gyrus (t = 2.63, p = .010), a dorsal stream area, predicted severity of viewer-centered neglect independently of the other variables. The same variables predicted the presence of significant viewer-centered neglect. In contrast, these variables did not significantly predict the severity of stimulus-centered neglect. However, we found that percent damage to ventral stream regions of interest (middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal occipital gyrus, sagittal stratum, along with total infarct volume were associated with the presence of significant stimulus-centered neglect (pseudo r(2) = .70, p < .0004). Only percent damage to right inferior temporal gyrus predicted stimulus-centered neglect independently of the other variables (p = .018). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  -  HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING

N2  -  Human brain pathways required for language processing are poorly known. A new white matter tract in humans, the middle longitudinal fascicle, has recently been anatomically determined by diffusion tensor imaging and suggested to be essential for language. Our aim is to determine the importance of the middle longitudinal fascicle for language processing. This study is based on 8 patients with glioma resection at least involving the superior temporal gyrus of the left dominant hemisphere. Language is systematically examined pre- and postoperatively at 3 months. Intraoperative electrostimulation is used to map cortical and subcortical structures as functional boundaries of the glioma resection, including those essential for language processing. The resections are extensive (on average 62 ml, ranging from 21 to 111 ml) and include a large part of the middle longitudinal fascicle in all patients. Intraoperatively, no interference with picture naming is observed by electrostimulation of the middle longitudinal fascicle, while in all patients the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle is identified by eliciting semantic paraphasia as functional boundary. Postoperatively, no new permanent language deficits are detected by systematic language examination. Therefore, we suggest that the middle longitudinal fascicle may participate but is not essential for language processing. Hum Brain Mapp 32:962-973, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T2  -  WORLD NEUROSURGERY

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Supplementary motor area syndrome (SMAS) may occur after frontal tumor surgery, with variable presentation and outcomes. We reviewed the literature on postoperative SMAS after brain tumor resection.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched following the PRISMA guidelines to include studies reporting SMAS after brain tumor resection.; RESULTS: We included 31 studies encompassing 236 patients. Most tumors were gliomas (94.5%), frequently of low grade (61.4%). Most lesions were located on the left hemisphere (64.4%), involving the supplementary motor area (61.4%) and the cingulate gyrus (20.8%). Tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging evaluation were completed in 45 (19.1%) and 26 (11%) patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 46.3% patients and complete SMA resection in 69.4%. A total of 215 procedures (91.1%) used intraoperative neuromonitoring mostly consisting of direct corticalsubcortical stimulation (56.4%), motor (33.9%), and somatosensory (25.4%) evoked potentials. Postoperative SMAS symptoms occurred within 24 hours after surgery, characterized by motor deficits (97%), including paresis (68.6%) and hemiplegia (16.1%), and speech disorders (53%), including hesitancy (24.2%) and mutism (22%). Average SMAS duration was 45 days (range, 1-365 days), with total resolution occurring in 188 patients (79.7%) and partial improvement in 46 (19.5%). Forty-eight patients (20.3%) had persisting symptoms, mostly speech hesitancy (60.4%) and fine motor disorders (45.8%).; CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative SMAS may occur within the first 24 hours after mesial frontal tumor surgery. Preoperative mapping and intraoperative neuromonitoring may assist resection and predict outcomes. Neuroplasticity and interhemispheric connectivity play a major role in resolution.

N2  -  To study the between-scanner variation and the between-visit reproducibility of brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in the setting of a multi-center chemotherapy clinical trial for glioblastoma multiforme.
ADC maps of 52 patients at six sites were calculated in-house from diffusion-weighted images obtained by seven individual scanner models of two vendors. The median and coefficient of variation (CV) of normal brain white matter ADC values from a defined region of interest were used to evaluate the differences among scanner models, vendors, magnetic fields, as well as successive visits. All patients participating in this study signed institutional review board approved informed consent. Data acquisition was performed in compliance with all applicable Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. The study spanned from August 1, 2006, to January 29, 2008.; For baseline median ADC, no difference was observed between the different scanner models, different vendors, and different magnetic field strength. For baseline ADC CV, a significant difference was found between different scanner models (p = 0.0002). No between-scanner difference was observed in ADC changes between two visits. For between-visit reproducibility, significant difference was seen between the ADC values measured at two successive visits for the whole patient group.; The CVs varied significantly between scanners, presumably due to image noise. Consistent scanner parameter setup can improve reproducibility of the ADC measurements between visits.

N2  -  The immunohistochemical profile of neurotrophins and their receptors in the human cranial dura mater was studied by examining certain dural zones in specimens harvested from different regions (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital). Dural specimens were obtained during neurosurgical operations performed in ten patients for surgical treatment of intracranial lesions (meningiomas, traumas, gliomas, vascular malformations). The dural fragments were taken from the area of the craniotomy at least 8 cm from the lesion as well as front the area in which the meningioma had its dural attachment. Immunohistochemical characterization and distribution of neurotrophins, with their receptors, were analyzed. The concrete role played by these neurotrophic factors in general regulation, vascular permeability, algic responsivity and release of locally active substances in the human dura mater is still controversial. Our study revealed a general structural alteration of dural tissue due to the invasivity of meningiomatous lesions, together with an improved expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in highly proliferating neoplastic cells and an evident production of nerve growth factor (NGF) in inflammatory cells, suggesting that BDNF has a role in supporting the proliferation rate of neoplastic cells, while NGF is involved in the activation of a chronic inflammatory response in neoplastic areas.

N2  -  This is the first published case of a child with a dentigerous cyst involving the pterygopalatine fossa causing an orbital apex syndrome. This case is important for publication so the dentigerous cyst is included clinicians' differentials and given its description of a safe approach to management. An otherwise well 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of right toothache and altered vision, followed by a 1-day history of a painful right eye turning outwards. On examination, there was reduced right eye visual acuity with adduction and vertical gaze deficit, partial lid ptosis and anisocoria. An MRI Brain with contrast demonstrated a lobulated T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion involving the right pterygopalatine fossa without diffusion restriction or post-contrast enhancement. CT Head/Face + stealth protocol imaging was arranged which was correlated with the MRI to demonstrate the well-defined low-density lesion within the right cavernous sinus extending through the pterygopalatine fossa into the masticator space causing bony expansion without erosion and closely related to a tooth root. Multidisciplinary input was sought from ophthalmology, ENT, neurosurgery, radiology, pathology, paediatric medicine and paediatric oncology teams. The patient underwent an endoscopic excision of the lesion (with sublabial incision/anterior transmaxillary window) under image guidance. Macroscopic removal of the cyst was achieved. Histopathology confirmed a benign cyst and dental follicle tissue concluded to be in keeping with a dentigerous cyst. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The child was well at the 2-week and 6-week follow up with ophthalmology review noting improved adduction. An MRI is planned for 4 months postoperatively.

N2  -  Introduction: The connections of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) with motor areas of the central nervous system (CNS) are well described in the literature, in contrast relations with non-motor areas are lacking. Thus, the aim of the present study is to define the non-motor connections of the PPN in rats using the fluoro-gold (FG) tracer and compare the presence of these connections in healthy human adults using diffusion tensor tractography (DTI). Materials and Methods: We injected FG into the PPN of 12 rats. The non-motor connections of the PPN with cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures were documented. The non-motor connections of the rats were compared with the DTI obtained from 35 healthy adults. Results: The results of the tract-tracing study in the rat showed that the PPN was connected to non-motor cortical (cingulate, somatosensory, visual, auditory, medial frontal cortices), subcortical (amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, habenular, and bed nucleus of stria terminalis), and brainstem (medullary reticular, trigeminal spinal, external cuneate, pontine reticular, vestibular, superior and inferior colliculus, locus ceruleus, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial, dorsal raphe, pretectal, lateral lemniscus nuclei, and the contralateral PPN) structures. The DTI obtained from healthy adults showed similar PPN non-motor connections as in rats. Conclusion: Understanding the connections of the PPN with non-motor cortical, subcortical, and brainstem areas of the CNS will enrich our knowledge of its contribution in various circuits and the areas that PPN activity can influence. Further, it will provide insight into the role of Parkinson's disease and related disorders and explain the non-motor complications which occur subsequent to deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the PPN.

N2  -  It is important to estimate motor recovery in the early phase after stroke. Many studies have demonstrated that both diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are valuable predictors of motor recovery, but these modalities do not directly reflect the status of the injured gray matter. We report on 2 subjects with basal ganglia hemorrhage who showed similar DTT and MEP findings, but had markedly different clinical outcomes. Specifically, Subject 1 showed no improvement in motor function, whereas Subject 2 exhibited substantial improvement 7 weeks after onset. To determine if differences in gray matter might lend insight into these different outcomes, we analyzed gray matter lesions of the 2 subjects using a novel voxel-based lesion mapping method. The lesion of Subject 1 mainly included the putamen, thalamus, and Heschl's gyri, indicating extension of the hemorrhage in the posterior direction. In contrast, the lesion of Subject 2 mainly included the putamen, insula, and pallidum, indicating that the hemorrhage extended anterior laterally. These differential findings suggest that voxel-based gray matter lesion mapping may help to predict differential motor recovery in subjects with basal ganglia hemorrhage with similar DTT and MEP findings.

N2  -  CNS invasion has been included as an independent criterion for the diagnosis of a high-grade (WHO and CNS grade 2 and 3) meningioma in the 2016 and more recently in the 2021 WHO classification. However, the prognostic role of brain invasion has recently been questioned. Also, surgical treatment for brain invasive meningiomas may pose specific challenges. We conducted a systematic review of the 2016-2022 literature on brain invasive meningiomas in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. The prognostic relevance of brain invasion as a stand-alone criterion is still unclear. Additional and larger studies using robust definitions of histological brain invasion and addressing the issue of sampling errors are clearly warranted. Although the necessity of molecular profiling in meningioma grading, prognostication and decision making in the future is obvious, specific markers for brain invasion are lacking for the time being. Advanced neuroimaging may predict CNS invasion preoperatively. The extent of resection (e.g., the Simpson grading) is an important predictor of tumor recurrence especially in higher grade meningiomas, but also - although likely to a lesser degree - in benign tumors, and therefore also in brain invasive meningiomas with and without other histological features of atypia or malignancy. Hence, surgery for brain invasive meningiomas should follow the principles of maximal but safe resections. There are some data to suggest that safety and functional outcomes in such cases may benefit from the armamentarium of surgical adjuncts commonly used for surgery of eloquent gliomas such as intraoperative monitoring, awake craniotomy, DTI tractography and further advanced intraoperative brain tumor visualization.

N2  -  Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is particularly sensitive for the detection of acute stoke. Until recently, DWI was performed with EPI technology. We compared 18 patients with clinical suspicion of acute stroke on a standard 1.5T unit and an open low-field MR scanner. Eighteen patients with 20 lesions of acute stroke were studied retrospectively with DWI and ADC mapping on both systems. The technique used was a rotating fast-spin echo T2 at low-field and an EPI sequence at 1.5T. Both examinations were performed within 24 hours and analyzed by two neuroradiologists. We obtained the same results on DWI sequences on both systems, regarding high intensity lesions on DWI. Interpretation of the ADC maps proved to be difficult on low-field MR near the lateral ventricles (3/18). We experienced the same difficulty of interpretation at low and high field in the cerebellum, in the temporal fossa and in cortex situated near bone, due to susceptibility artifacts. Chronic lesions were better visualized at low than at high field. In our opinion, DWI on a low-field open MR scanner is a good technique to evaluate subacute stroke and was as reliable as when performed on a 1.5T MR system.

N2  -  Acute strokes can affect heart rate variability (HRV), the mechanisms how are not well understood. We included 42 acute stroke patients (2-7 days after ischemic stroke, mean age 66 years, 16 women). For analysis of HRV, 20 matched controls (mean age 60.7, 10 women) were recruited. HRV was assessed at rest, in a supine position and individual breathing rhythmus for 5 min. The coefficient of variation (VC), the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the powers of low (LF, 0.04-0.14 Hz) and high (HF, 0.15-0.50 Hz) frequency bands were extracted. HRV parameters were z-transformed related to age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Z-values < -1 indicate reduced HRV. Acute stroke lesions were marked on diffusion-weighted images employing MRIcroN and co-registered to a T1-weighted structural volume-dataset. Using independent component analysis (ICA), stroke lesions were related to HRV. Subsequently, we used the ICA-derived lesion pattern as a seed and estimated the connectivity between these brain regions and seven common functional networks, which were obtained from 50 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age 68.9, 27 women). Especially, LF and VC were frequently reduced in patients. ICA revealed one covarying lesion pattern for LF and one similar for VC, predominantly affecting the right hemisphere. Activity in brain areas corresponding to these lesions mainly impact on limbic (r = 0.55 +/- 0.08) and salience ventral attention networks (0.61 +/- 0.10) in the group with reduced LF power (z-score < -1), but on control and default mode networks in the group with physiological LF power (z-score > -1). No different connectivity could be found for the respective VC groups. Our results suggest that HRV alteration after acute stroke might be due to affecting resting-state brain networks.

T2  -  MOLECULAR AUTISM

N2  -  Background: The inbred mouse strain BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) exhibits behavioral deficits that mimic the core deficits of autism. Neuroanatomically, the BTBR strain is also characterized by a complete absence of the corpus callosum. The goal of this study was to identify novel molecular and cellular changes in the BTBR mouse, focusing on neuronal, synaptic, glial and plasticity markers in the limbic system as a model for identifying putative molecular and cellular substrates associated with autistic behaviors.
Methods: Forebrains of 8 to 10-week-old male BTBR and age-matched C57Bl6J control mice were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using free-floating and paraffin embedded sections. Twenty antibodies directed against antigens specific to neurons, synapses and glia were used. Nissl, Timm and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) stains were performed to assess cytoarchitecture, mossy fibers and cholinergic fiber density, respectively. In the hippocampus, quantitative stereological estimates for the mitotic marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were performed to determine hippocampal progenitor proliferation, survival and differentiation, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA was quantified by in situ hybridization. Quantitative image analysis was performed for NG2, doublecortin (DCX), NeuroD, GAD67 and Poly-Sialic Acid Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (PSA-NCAM).; Results: In midline structures including the region of the absent corpus callosum of BTBR mice, the myelin markers 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were reduced, and the oligodendrocyte precursor NG2 was increased. MBP and CNPase were expressed in small ectopic white matter bundles within the cingulate cortex. Microglia and astrocytes showed no evidence of gliosis, yet orientations of glial fibers were altered in specific white-matter areas. In the hippocampus, evidence of reduced neurogenesis included significant reductions in the number of doublecortin, PSA-NCAM and NeuroD immunoreactive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, and a marked reduction in the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) positive progenitors. Furthermore, a significant and profound reduction in BDNF mRNA was seen in the BTBR dentate gyrus. No significant differences were seen in the expression of AchE, mossy fiber synapses or immunoreactivities of microtubule-associated protein MAP2, parvalbumin and glutamate decarboxylase GAD65 or GAD67 isoforms.; Conclusions: We documented modest and selective alterations in glia, neurons and synapses in BTBR forebrain, along with reduced neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Of all markers examined, the most distinctive changes were seen in the neurodevelopmental proteins NG2, PSA-NCAM, NeuroD and DCX. Our results are consistent with aberrant development of the nervous system in BTBR mice, and may reveal novel substrates to link callosal abnormalities and autistic behaviors. The changes that we observed in the BTBR mice suggest potential novel therapeutic strategies for intervention in autism spectrum disorders.

N2  -  The detection of MRI abnormalities that can be associated to seizures in the study of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging task. In many cases, patients with a record of epileptic activity do not present any discernible MRI findings. In this domain, we propose a method that combines quantitative relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with support vector machines (SVM) aiming to improve TLE detection. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: on one hand, the feature selection process, principal component analysis (PCA) transformations of the feature space, and SVM parameterization are analyzed as factors constituting a classification model and influencing its quality. On the other hand, several of these classification models are studied to determine the optimal strategy for the identification of TLE patients using data collected from multi-parametric quantitative MRI.
A total of 17 TLE patients and 19 control volunteers were analyzed. Four images were considered for each subject (T1 map, T2 map, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity) generating 936 regions of interest per subject, then 8 different classification models were studied, each one comprised by a distinct set of factors. Subjects were correctly classified with an accuracy of 88.9%. Further analysis revealed that the heterogeneous nature of the disease impeded an optimal outcome. After dividing patients into cohesive groups (9 left-sided seizure onset, 8 right-sided seizure onset) perfect classification for the left group was achieved (100% accuracy) whereas the accuracy for the right group remained the same (88.9%).; We conclude that a linear SVM combined with an ANOVA-based feature selection +PCA method is a good alternative in scenarios like ours where feature spaces are high dimensional, and the sample size is limited. The good accuracy results and the localization of the respective features in the temporal lobe suggest that a multi-parametric quantitative MRI, ROI-based, SVM classification could be used for the identification of TLE patients. This method has the potential to improve the diagnostic assessment, especially for patients who do not have any obvious lesions in standard radiological examinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Combinatorial syntax has been shown to be underpinned by cortical key regions such as Broca's area and temporal cortices, and by subcortical structures such as the striatum. The cortical regions are connected via several cortico-to-cortical tracts impacting syntactic processing (e.g., the arcuate) but it remains unclear whether and how the striatum can be integrated into this cortex-centered syntax network. Here, we used a systematic stepwise approach to investigate the existence and syntactic function of an additional deep Broca-striatum pathway. We first asked 15 healthy controls and 12 patients with frontal/striatal lesions to perform three syntax tests. The results obtained were subjected to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) to provide an anatomo-functional approximation of the pathway. The significant VLSM clusters were then overlapped with the probability maps of four cortico-cortical language tracts generated for 12 healthy participants (arcuate, extreme capsule fiber system, uncinate, aslant), including a probabilistic Broca-striatum tract. Finally, we carried out quantitative analyses of the relationship between the lesion load along the tracts and syntactic processing, by calculating tract-lesion overlap for each patient and analyzing the correlation with syntactic data. Our findings revealed a Broca-striatum tract linking BA45 with the left caudate head and overlapping with VLSM voxel clusters relating to complex syntax. The lesion load values for this tract were correlated with complex syntax scores, whereas no such correlation was observed for the other tracts. These results extend current syntax-network models, by adding a deep Broca-caudate pathway, and are consistent with functional accounts of frontostriatal circuits. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2270-2283, 2015.

N2  -  Background Preoperative evaluation of the consistency of pituitary macroadenomas is important for neurosurgeons to prepare the surgical plan. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis (TA) of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at a standard b-value (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) and a high b-value (b = 2000 s/mm(2)) for their ability to assess the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas. Study Type Retrospective. Population/Subjects Fifty patients with histologically confirmed pituitary macroadenomas were classified as soft (n = 37) or hard (n = 13) types. Field Strength/Sequence Coronal T-2-weighted imaging (T2WI), Readout Segmentation of Long Variable Echo-trains (RESOLVE) DWI at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and b = 2000 s/mm(2) were acquired with 3.0T MRI. Assessment The corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (ADC(1000) and ADC(2000)) were registered to T2WI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn along the solid part of the tumor from the coregistered T2WI-ADC images. The texture parameters from T2WI, ADC(1000), and ADC(2000) were acquired. Statistical Tests The texture parameters were compared between the two types by using unpaired Student's t-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression analyses were used to assess their diagnostic performance. Results Significant differences in TA parameters of ADC(1000) and ADC(2000) were observed between soft and hard types (P < 0.05 for all), whereas the TA of T2WI resulted in no significant difference (P > 0.05 for all). TA of ADC(2000) provided a superior diagnostic performance compared with that of ADC(1000) (P = 0.038). A combination of mean value and entropy of ADC(2000) yielded an AUC, a sensitivity, and a specificity of 0.911, 78.4% and 92.3%, respectively. Data Conclusion TA of ADC values were useful for assessing the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas. ADC(2000) may facilitate better type discrimination. Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Concerns have arisen about the long-term health effects of repeat gadolinium injections in patients with multiple sclerosis and the incomplete characterization of MS lesion pathophysiology that results from relying on enhancement characteristics alone.
PURPOSE: Our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis analyzing whether noncontrast MR imaging biomarkers can distinguish enhancing and nonenhancing brain MS lesions.; DATA SOURCES: Our sources were Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane data base from inception to August 2016.; STUDY SELECTION: We included 37 journal articles on 985 patients with MS who had MR imaging in which T1-weighted postcontrast sequences were compared with noncontrast sequences obtained during the same MR imaging examination by using ROI analysis of individual MS lesions.; DATA ANALYSIS: We performed random-effects meta-analyses comparing the standard mean difference of each MR imaging metric taken from enhancing-versus-nonenhancing lesions.; DATA SYNTHESIS: DTI-based fractional anisotropy values are significantly different between enhancing and nonenhancing lesions (P = .02), with enhancing lesions showing decreased fractional anisotropy compared with nonenhancing lesions. Of the other most frequently studied MR imaging biomarkers (mean diffusivity, magnetization transfer ratio, or ADC), none were significantly different (P values of 0.30, 0.47, and 0.19. respectively) between enhancing and nonenhancing lesions. Of the limited studies providing diagnostic accuracy measures, gradient-echo-based quantitative susceptibility mapping had the best performance in discriminating enhancing and nonenhancing MS lesions.; LIMITATIONS: MR imaging techniques and patient characteristics were variable across studies. Most studies did not provide diagnostic accuracy measures. All imaging metrics were not studied in all 37 studies.; CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast MR imaging techniques, such as DTI-based FA, can assess MS lesion acuity without gadolinium.

N2  -  Background: Glioblastomas are highly infiltrative tumors, and differentiating between non-enhancing tumors (NETs) and vasogenic edema (Edemas) occurring in the non-enhancing T2-weighted hyperintense area is chal-lenging. Here, we differentiated between NETs and Edemas in glioblastomas using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Materials and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from 21 patients with primary glioblastomas, three with metastasis, and two with meningioma as controls. MRI data included T2 weighted images and contrast enhanced T1 weighted images, NODDI, and DTI. Three neurosurgeons manually assigned volumes of interest (VOIs) to the NETs and Edemas. The DTI and NODDI-derived parameters calculated for each VOI were fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), and orientation dispersion index.Results: Sixteen and 14 VOIs were placed on NETs and Edemas, respectively. The ICVF, ISOVF, FA, and ADC values of NETs and Edemas differed significantly (p < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that using all parameters allowed for improved differentiation of NETs from Edemas (area under the curve = 0.918) from the use of NODDI parameters (0.910) or DTI parameters (0.899). Multiple logistic regression was performed with all parameters, and a predictive formula to differentiate between NETs and Edemas could be created and applied to the edematous regions of the negative control-group images; the tumor prediction degree was well below 0.5, confirming differentiation as edema.Conclusions: Using NODDI and DTI may prove useful in differentiating NETs from Edemas in the non-contrast T2 hyperintensity region of glioblastomas.

N2  -  Obtaining accurate quantitative information on the concentration and distribution of fluorescent markers lying at a depth below the surface of optically turbid media, such as tissue, is a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a fluorescence reconstruction technique based on a diffusion light transport model that can be used during surgery, including guiding resection of brain tumors, for depth-resolved quantitative imaging of near-infrared fluorescent markers. Hyperspectral fluorescence images are used to compute a topographic map of the fluorophore distribution, which yields structural and optical constraints for a three-dimensional subsequent hyperspectral diffuse fluorescence reconstruction algorithm. Using the model fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 and brain-like tissue phantoms, the technique yielded estimates of fluorophore concentration within +/- 25% of the true value to depths of 5 to 9 mm, depending on the concentration. The approach is practical for integration into a neurosurgical fluorescence microscope and has potential to further extend fluorescence-guided resection using objective and quantified metrics of the presence of residual tumor tissue.

T2  -  NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS

N2  -  Contrary to common psychosurgical practice in the 1950s, Dr. Jean Talairach had the intuition, based on clinical experience, that the brain connectome and neuroplasticity had a role to play in psychosurgery. Due to the remarkable progress of pharmacology at that time and to the technical limits of neurosurgery, these concepts were not put into practice. Currently, these concepts are being confirmed by modern techniques such as neuroimaging and computational neurosciences, and could pave the way for therapeutic innovation in psychiatry.
Psychosurgery commonly uses a localizationist approach, based on the idea that a lesion to a specific area is responsible for a deficit opposite to its function. To psychosurgeons such as Walter Freeman, who performed extensive lesions causing apparently inevitable deficit, Talairach answered with clinical data: complex psychic functions cannot be described that simply, because the same lesion does not provoke the same deficit in different patients. Moreover, cognitive impairment did not always follow efficacious psychosurgery. Talairach suggested that selectively destructing part of a network could open the door to a new organization, and that early psychotherapy could encourage this psychoplasticity. Talairach did not have the opportunity to put these concepts into practice in psychiatric diseases because of the sudden availability of neuroleptics, but connectomics and neuroplasticity gave rise to major advances in intraparenchymal neurosurgery, from epilepsy to low-grade glioma. In psychiatry, alongside long-standing theories implicating focal lesions and diffuse pathological processes, neuroimaging techniques are currently being developed. In mentally healthy individuals, combining diffusion tensor imaging with functional MRI, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography allows the determination of a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain on many spatial scales, the so-called connectome. Ultimately, global neurocomputational models could predict physiological activity, behavior, and subjective feeling, and describe neuropsychiatric disorders.; Connectomic studies comparing psychiatric patients with controls have already confirmed the early intuitions of Talairach. As a striking example, massive dysconnectivity has been found in schizophrenia, leading some authors to propose a "dysconnection hypothesis." Alterations of the connectome have also been demonstrated in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. Furthermore, normalization of the functional dysconnectivity has been observed following clinical improvement in several therapeutic interventions, from psychotherapy to pharmacological treatments. Provided that mental disorders result from abnormal structural or functional wiring, targeted psychosurgery would require that one be able: 1) to identify the pathological network involved in a given patient; 2) to use neurostimulation to safely create a reversible and durable alteration, mimicking a lesion, in a network compatible with neuroplasticity; and 3) to predict which functional lesion would result in adapted neuronal plasticity andor to guide neuronal plasticity to promote recovery. All these conditions, already suggested by Talairach, could now be achievable considering modern biomarkers and surgical progress.

N2  -  Introduction The fourth Industrial Revolution has touched nearly all aspects of neurosurgery and the newer tubular retractor systems are a testimony to this fact. They aid in providing better visualization with minimal damage to those neural structures, which happen to be innocent bystanders overlying the path of deep-seated lesions. In addition to providing better patient outcomes they are surgeon friendly with their ergonomic design and improved stability, thereby causing minimal fatigue, and aid in procedures requiring precision and perseverance. A retrospective study conducted at a single institute analyzed the efficacy of transparent tubular retractors during cranial surgery for deep-seated lesions. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted between April 2015 and July 2018 in a single institute wherein 22 patents with various deep-seated intracranial lesions were operated using the transparent tubular retractor, View Site Brain Access System (VBAS, Vycor Medical Inc.). Observation Of the 22 cases, 45% were of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage; 27% were high-grade gliomas; and the rest were colloid cyst, cystic tumors, and metastatic tumors in equal proportion. Total tumor excision was achieved in 27%, while 90% excision was achieved in 45% cases. The overall complication rate was 13%. Conclusion The transparent tubular retractors contribute to minimal invasiveness by causing uniform distribution of retraction pressure and minimal disruption of fiber tracts. Their use has a definite role in improving surgical outcomes for deep-seated intracranial lesions.

N2  -  Introduction
Neuronavigation greatly improves the surgeon's ability to approach, assess and operate on brain tumors, but tends to lose its accuracy as the surgery progresses and substantial brain shift and deformation occurs. Intraoperative MRI (iMRI) can partially address this problem but is resource intensive and workflow disruptive. Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) provides real-time information that can be used to update neuronavigation and provide real-time information regarding the resection progress. We describe the intraoperative use of 3D iUS in relation to iMRI, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in its use in neurosurgical practice.; Methods; We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent image-guided brain tumor resection in which both 3D iUS and iMRI were used. The study was conducted between June 2020 and December 2020 when an extension of a commercially available navigation software was introduced in our practice enabling 3D iUS volumes to be reconstructed from tracked 2D iUS images. For each patient, three or more 3D iUS images were acquired during the procedure, and one iMRI was acquired towards the end. The iUS images included an extradural ultrasound sweep acquired before dural incision (iUS-1), a post-dural opening iUS (iUS-2), and a third iUS acquired immediately before the iMRI acquisition (iUS-3). iUS-1 and preoperative MRI were compared to evaluate the ability of iUS to visualize tumor boundaries and critical anatomic landmarks; iUS-3 and iMRI were compared to evaluate the ability of iUS for predicting residual tumor.; Results; Twenty-three patients were included in this study. Fifteen patients had tumors located in eloquent or near eloquent brain regions, the majority of patients had low grade gliomas (11), gross total resection was achieved in 12 patients, postoperative temporary deficits were observed in five patients. In twenty-two iUS was able to define tumor location, tumor margins, and was able to indicate relevant landmarks for orientation and guidance. In sixteen cases, white matter fiber tracts computed from preoperative dMRI were overlaid on the iUS images. In nineteen patients, the EOR (GTR or STR) was predicted by iUS and confirmed by iMRI. The remaining four patients where iUS was not able to evaluate the presence or absence of residual tumor were recurrent cases with a previous surgical cavity that hindered good contact between the US probe and the brain surface.; Conclusion; This recent experience at our institution illustrates the practical benefits, challenges, and opportunities of 3D iUS in relation to iMRI.

N2  -  A 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease presented with 7 months of difficulty walking. Initial examination 3 months prior to admission to our hospital was thought to be consistent with a polyneuropathy. He was areflexic, was unable to stand on toes or heels with decreased sensation on the left foot to light touch and vibration, had difficulty with heel to shin, and was unable to perform tandem gait. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL) and elevated creatinine (1.49 g/dL). HIV, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, hepatitis serologies, rapid plasma reagin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, copper, SSA/B, and Lyme titers were unremarkable. B-12 deficiency (B-12 188 pg/mL) and a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 24 mm/hour were found. Initial MRI brain showed multiple foci of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesions in the subcortical and periventricular white matter. Lesions did not restrict on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); however, a few lesions demonstrated enhancement with gadolinium. MRI of the spine was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) was remarkable for a CSF protein of 144 mg/dL, leukocytes 43/mu L (92% lymphocytes), erythrocytes 2,400/mu L, and glucose 41 mg/dL. There were no oligoclonal bands. The patient was treated with IM injections of B-12, without improvement in his deficits.

N2  -  YResponse criteria for paediatric high-grade glioma vary historically and across different cooperative groups. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group developed response criteria for adult high-grade glioma, but these were not created to meet the unique challenges in children with the disease. The Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) working group, consisting of an international panel of paediatric and adult neuro-oncologists, clinicians, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and neurosurgeons, was established to address issues and unique challenges in assessing response in children with CNS tumours. We established a subcommittee to develop response assessment criteria for paediatric high-grade glioma. Current practice and literature were reviewed to identify major challenges in assessing the response of paediatric high-grade gliomas to various treatments. For areas in which scientific investigation was scarce, consensus was reached through an iterative process. RAPNO response assessment recommendations include the use of MRI of the brain and the spine, assessment of clinical status, and the use of corticosteroids or antiangiogenics. Imaging standards for brain and spine are defined. Compared with the recommendations for the management of adult high-grade glioma, for paediatrics there is inclusion of diffusion-weighted imaging and a higher reliance on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Consensus recommendations and response definitions have been established and, similar to other RAPNO recommendations, prospective validation in clinical trials is warranted.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In cerebral gliomas, rCBV correlates with tumor grade and histologic findings of vascular proliferation. Moreover, ADC assesses water diffusivity and is inversely correlated with tumor grade. In the present work, we have studied whether combined rCBV and ADC values improve the diagnostic accuracy of MR imaging in the preoperative grading of gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients with histopathologically confirmed diffuse gliomas underwent DWI and DSC. Mean rCBV and ADC values were compared among the tumor groups with the Student t test or ANOVA. ROC analysis was used to determine rCBV and ADC threshold values for glioma grading.; RESULTS: rCBV had significantly different values between grade II and IV gliomas and between grade III and IV tumors, but there were no significant differences between grade II and III gliomas (P > .05). Grade II and III tumors also did not differ when astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas were considered separately. ADC values were significantly different for all 3 grades. The ADC threshold value of 1.185 x 10(-3) mm(2)s and the rCBV cutoff value of 1.74 could be used with high sensitivity in the characterization of high-grade gliomas. The area under the ROC curve for the maximum rCBV and minimum ADC was 0.72 and 0.75, respectively. The combination of rCBV and ADC values increased the area under the ROC curve to 0.83.; CONCLUSIONS: ADC measurements are better than rCBV values for distinguishing the grades of gliomas. The combination of minimum ADC and maximum rCBV improves the diagnostic accuracy of glioma grading.

N2  -  Halai et al. report a systematic comparison of machine learning algorithms that predict the speech impairments of aphasia patients from brain scans, identifying which algorithms and types of neuroimaging data improve predictions of behavioural outcomes.
Neuroimaging has radically improved our understanding of how speech and language abilities map to the brain in normal and impaired participants, including the diverse, graded variations observed in post-stroke aphasia. A handful of studies have begun to explore the reverse inference: creating brain-to-behaviour prediction models. In this study, we explored the effect of three critical parameters on model performance: (1) brain partitions as predictive features, (2) combination of multimodal neuroimaging and (3) type of machine learning algorithms. We explored the influence of these factors while predicting four principal dimensions of language and cognition variation in post-stroke aphasia. Across all four behavioural dimensions, we consistently found that prediction models derived from diffusion-weighted data did not improve performance over models using structural measures extracted from T1 scans. Our results provide a set of principles to guide future work aiming to predict outcomes in neurological patients from brain imaging data.

N2  -  Lesion-symptom mapping is often employed to define brain structures that are crucial for human behavior. Even though poststroke deficits result from gray matter damage as well as secondary white matter loss, the impact of structural disconnection is overlooked by conventional lesion-symptom mapping because it does not measure loss of connectivity beyond the stroke lesion. This study describes how traditional lesion mapping can be combined with structural connectome lesion symptom mapping (CLSM) and connectome dynamics lesion symptom mapping (CDLSM) to relate residual white matter networks to behavior. Using data from a large cohort of stroke survivors with aphasia, we observed improved prediction of aphasia severity when traditional lesion symptom mapping was combined with CLSM and CDLSM. Moreover, only CLSM and CDLSM disclosed the importance of temporal-parietal junction connections in aphasia severity. In summary, connectome measures can uniquely reveal brain networks that are necessary for function, improving the traditional lesion symptom mapping approach.

N2  -  Previous studies of brain lesions, functional activity, and gray matter structures have suggested that emotional intelligence (EI) is associated with regions involved in the network of social cognition (SCN) and in somatic marker circuitry (SMC). Our new study is the first to investigate the association between white matter (WM) integrity and EI. We examined this relationship in the brain of healthy young adult men [n = 74, mean age = 21.5 years, standard deviation (SD) = 1.6] and women (n = 44, mean age = 21.9 years, SD = 1.4). We performed a voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy, which is an indicator of WM integrity, using diffusion tensor imaging and used a questionnaire (EI Scale) for measuring EI to identify the correlation of WM integrity with individual EI factor (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and situation management factors). Our results showed that (a) the intrapersonal factor of EI was positively correlated with WM integrity in the right anterior insula, and (b) the interpersonal factor of EI was associated with WM integrity in a part of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). The right anterior insula is one of the important nodes of the SMC, whereas the ILF connects the visual cortex and areas related to SCN, and thus, is a part of the SCN. Our findings further support the notion that the brain regions involved in the SCN and in the SMC are associated with EI. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Introduction: Neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) has been shown to affect white matter (WM) microstructure beyond the lesion. Here, we employed fixel-based analysis, a technique which allows to model and interpret WM alterations in complex arrangements such as crossing fibers, to further characterize the long-term effects of NAIS on the entire WM outside the primary infarct area. Materials and methods: 32 children (mean age 7.3 years (SD 0.4), 19 male) with middle cerebral artery NAIS (18 left hemisphere, 14 right hemisphere) and 31 healthy controls (mean age 7.7 years (SD 0.6), 16 male) underwent diffusion MRI scans and clinical examination for manual dexterity. Microstructural and macrostructural properties of the WM were investigated in a fixel-based whole-brain analysis, which allows to detect fiber-specific effects. Additionally, tract-averaged fixel metrics in interhemispheric tracts, and their correlation with manual dexterity, were examined. Results: Significantly reduced microstructural properties were identified, located within the parietal and temporal WM of the affected hemisphere, as well as within their interhemispheric connecting tracts. Tract-averaged fixel metrics showed moderate, significant correlation with manual dexterity of the affected hand. No increased fixel metrics or contralesional alterations were observed. Discussion: Our results show that NAIS leads to long-term alterations in WM microstructure distant from the lesion site, both within the parietal and temporal lobes as well as in their interhemispheric connections. The functional significance of these findings is demonstrated by the correlations with manual dexterity. The localization of alterations in structures highly connected to the lesioned areas shift our perception of NAIS from a focal towards a developmental network injury.

N2  -  Mounting evidences have shown that progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) with vascular origin might cause cognitive dysfunction symptoms through their effects on brain networks. However, the vulnerability of specific neural connection related to WMHs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) still remains unclear. In this study, we established an atlas-guided computational framework based on brain disconnectome to assess the spatial-temporal patterns of WMH-related structural disconnectivity within a longitudinal investigation. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was adopted with 91, 90 and 44 subjects including in cognitive normal aging, stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. The parcel-wise disconnectome was computed by indirect mapping of individual WMHs onto population-averaged tractography atlas. By performing chi-square test, we discovered a spatial-temporal pattern of brain disconnectome along AD evolution. When applied such pattern as predictor, our models achieved highest mean accuracy of 0.82, mean sensitivity of 0.86, mean specificity of 0.82 and mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for predicting conversion from MCI to dementia, which outperformed methods utilizing lesion volume as predictors. Our analysis suggests that brain WMH-related structural disconnectome contributes to AD evolution mainly through attacking connections between: (1) parahippocampal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, orbital gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex; and (2) hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, which are also vulnerable to A beta and tau confirmed by other researches. All the results further indicate that a synergistic relationship exists between multiple contributors of AD as they attack similar brain connectivity at the prodromal stage of disease.

N2  -  Background: Former comparisons between direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) only focused on cortical mapping. While both can be combined with diffusion tensor imaging, their differences in the visualization of subcortical and even network levels remain unclear. Network centrality is an essential parameter in network analysis to measure the importance of nodes identified by mapping. Those include Degree centrality, Eigenvector centrality, Closeness centrality, Betweenness centrality, and PageRank centrality. While DCS and nTMS have repeatedly been compared on the cortical level, the underlying network identified by both has not been investigated yet. Method: 27 patients with brain lesions necessitating preoperative nTMS and intraoperative DCS language mapping during awake craniotomy were enrolled. Function -based connectome analysis was performed based on the cortical nodes obtained through the two mapping methods, and language -related network centralities were compared. Results: Compared with DCS language mapping, the positive predictive value of cortical nTMS language mapping is 74.1%, with good consistency of tractography for the arcuate fascicle and superior longitudinal fascicle. Moreover, network centralities did not differ between the two mapping methods. However, ventral stream tracts can be better traced based on nTMS mappings, demonstrating its strengths in acquiring language -related networks. In addition, it showed lower centralities than other brain areas, with decentralization as an indicator of language function loss. Conclusion: This study deepens the understanding of language -related functional anatomy and proves that non-invasive mapping -based network analysis is comparable to the language network identified via invasive cortical mapping.

N2  -  The structural heterogeneity of tumor tissue can be probed by diffusion MRI (dMRI) in terms of the variance of apparent diffusivities within a voxel. However, the link between the diffusional variance and the tissue heterogeneity is not well-established. To investigate this link we test the hypothesis that diffusional variance, caused by microscopic anisotropy and isotropic heterogeneity, is associated with variable cell eccentricity and cell density in brain tumors. We performed dMRI using a novel encoding scheme for diffusional variance decomposition (DI-VIDE) in 7 meningiomas and 8 gliomas prior to surgery. The diffusional variance was quantified from dMRI in terms of the total mean kurtosis (MKT), and DIVIDE was used to decompose MKT into components caused by microscopic anisotropy (MKA) and isotropic heterogeneity (MKI). Diffusion anisotropy was evaluated in terms of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and microscopic fractional anisotropy (mu FA). Quantitative microscopy was performed on the excised tumor tissue, where structural anisotropy and cell density were quantified by structure tensor analysis and cell nuclei segmentation, respectively. In order to validate the DIVIDE parameters they were correlated to the corresponding parameters derived from microscopy. We found an excellent agreement between the DIVIDE parameters and corresponding microscopy parameters; MKA correlated with cell eccentricity (r= 0.95, p < 10(-7)) and MKI with the cell density variance (r= 0.83, p < 10(-3)). The diffusion anisotropy correlated with structure tensor anisotropy on the voxel-scale (FA, r= 0.80, p < 10(-3)) and microscopic scale (mu FA, r = 0.93, p < 10(-6)). A multiple regression analysis showed that the conventional MKT parameter reflects both variable cell eccentricity and cell density, and therefore lacks specificity in terms of microstructure characteristics. However, specificity was obtained by decomposing the two contributions; MKA was associated only to cell eccentricity, and MKI only to cell density variance. The variance in meningiomas was caused primarily by microscopic anisotropy (mean +/- s.d.) MKA = 1.11 +/- 0.33 vs MKI = 0.44 +/- 0.20 (p < 10(-3)), whereas in the gliomas, it was mostly caused by isotropic heterogeneity MKI = 0.57 +/- 0.30 vs MKA = 0.26 +/- 0.11 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, DIVIDE allows non-invasive mapping of parameters that reflect variable cell eccentricity and density. These results constitute convincing evidence that a link exists between specific aspects of tissue heterogeneity and parameters from dMRI. Decomposing effects of microscopic anisotropy and isotropic heterogeneity facilitates an improved interpretation of tumor heterogeneity as well as diffusion anisotropy on both the microscopic and macroscopic scale.

N2  -  Neuroscience has a long history of inferring brain function by examining the relationship between brain injury and subsequent behavioral impairments. The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies have observed atrophy and abnormal diffusion within the CC in MS. However, few studies have addressed whether such abnormalities appear at the earliest stage of MS, especially in CIS. In this study, we aimed to investigate the CC integrity and patterns of CC abnormalities in CIS with diffusion tensor group tractography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, probability maps of the entire CC and its subregions (genu, body, and splenium) were created from 19 healthy subjects. Then these probability maps were used to evaluate diffusion within the entire CC and its segments in 19 patients with CIS. Five indices, including the midsagittal CC area, FA, MD, lambda(1), and lambda(23), were used to characterize CC integrity.; RESULTS: Significant differences were found between patients with CIS and healthy controls in the entire CC and its segments. For the entire CC, patients with CIS had a significantly lower midsagittal CC area and FA, higher MD and lambda(23), with a trend toward higher lambda(1). These 4 diffusion measures were correlated with T2 lesion volume. Moreover, abnormal white matter integrity was present in subregions of the CC; there was a robust significant increase in lambda(23) in the body and splenium and no difference in lambda(1) in the genu.; CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that atrophy and abnormal diffusion inside the CC appear at the stage of CIS and the severity of damage in the genu is milder than that in the body and splenium.

N2  -  Pyogenic brain abscesses (BA) are rare and their diagnosis may be difficult because of the absence of specific clinical or biological signs. However, the use of diffusion-weighted brain MRI sequences has modified the management of BA, as they are highly sensitive and specific to differentiate pyogenic brain abscesses from necrotic tumors, which are the most frequent differential diagnosis in case of ring-enhancing lesions on CT scan. This new tool allows for a rapid diagnosis and should be followed by a CT-guided aspiration of BA. This safe procedure should be performed if possible before starting antibiotics in order to optimize microbiological diagnosis. Recent epidemiological changes include an increase in the numbers of immuno compromised patients and a decrease in the traditional causes of BA (direct inoculation, ear nose and throat infections, etc.). In consequence, a wider range of bacterial species may be involved, making it all the more necessary to obtain a microbiological diagnosis. Many uncertainties remain in terms of the duration of antibiotic treatment, the optimal radiological follow-up and the place for associated treatments such as corticosteroids and anticonvulsive therapy. BA remain severe infections with high mortality and morbidity rates; the factor most regularly associated with a poor prognosis is the patients neurological status at diagnosis.

N2  -  Recently DW-MR Imaging has shown promising results in distinguishing between recurrent tumors and posttreatment changes in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSSC). Aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performances of DWI at high b-value (b = 2000 s/mm(2)) compared to standard b-value (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) and ADC(ratio) values (ADC(ratio) = ADC(2000)/ADC(1000) x 100) to differentiate recurrent tumors from posttreatment changes after treatment of HSNCC. 20 patients (16 M, 4 F) underwent MR Imaging between 2 and 16 months (mean 7) after treatment. Besides morphological sequences, we performed single-shot echoplanar DWI at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and b = 2000 s/mm(2), and corresponding ADC maps were generated (ADC(1000) and ADC(2000), resp.). By considering contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as references, ROIs were drawn in order to evaluate mean ADC(1000), ADC(2000), and ADC(ratio). The mean ADC(1000) and ADC(2000) in recurrent tumors were significantly lower than those in posttreatment changes (P = 0.001 and P = 0.016, resp.). Moreover, the mean ADC(ratio) between the two groups showed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.002). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ADC(ratio) were 82.0%, 100%, and 90%, respectively, by considering an optimal cutoff value of 65.5%. ADC(ratio) is a promising value to differentiate between recurrent tumors and posttreatment changes in HNSCC and may be more useful than ADC(1000) and ADC(2000).

N2  -  Neurons expressing neurokinin B (NK3) receptor in the basal forebrain region of rats were characterized histochemically by combining immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization and retrograde labeling, and electrophysiologically by whole-cell clamp recording. NK3 receptor-immunoreactive neurons were found in the basal forebrain region including the substantia innominata, where axon terminals immunoreactive for preprotachykinin B, the precursor peptide of neurokinin B (NKB), were densely distributed. More than 90% of NK3 receptor-expressing neurons in the basal forebrain region showed signals for glutamate decarboxylase mRNA, indicating that almost all NK3 receptor-expressing neurons were gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons. On the other hand, only a few NK3 receptor-immunoreactive neurons showed immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase or parvalbumin in the substantia innominata, ventral pallidum, and globus pallidus, although the distribution of NK3 receptor-expressing neurons overlapped with those of cholinergic neurons and parvalbumin-positive neurons. After injection of wheat germ agglutinin into the cerebral cortex, NK3 receptor immunoreactivity was detected in about 25% of retrogradely labeled basal forebrain neurons, indicating that NK3 receptor-expressing neurons send projection fibers to the cerebral cortex. In the whole-cell clamp recording study, a selective NK3 receptor agonist evoked membrane depolarization or inward currents with decrease of input impedance in 10 of 100 cortically projecting neurons recorded in the basal forebrain region. Because NKB-producing striatal neurons send axons selectively to the basal forebrain region (Furuta et al., 2000), the present results suggest that the release of NKB by those striatal neurons induces an inhibitory effect on cortical neurons via facilitation of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons expressing NK3 receptor.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the normal-appearing white matter of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: Fifty-seven patients with diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS and 47 age- and gender-matched controls were studied. A conventional MR imaging protocol and a DTI sequence were performed. One neuroradiologist placed the regions of interest (ROIs) in the FA maps in five different portions of the normal-apearing CC (rostrum, genu, anterior and posterior portion of the body and splenium) in all cases. The statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The FA values were lower in the MS patients compared with the controls (p < 0.05) in the following CC regions: rostrum (0.720 vs 0.819), anterior body (0.698 vs 0.752), posterior body (0.711 vs 0.759) and splenium (0.720 vs 0.880). Conclusion: In this series, there was a robust decrease in the FA in all regions of the normal-appearing CC, being significant in the rostrum, body and splenium. This finding suggests that there is a subtle and diffuse abnormality in the CC, which could be probably related to myelin content loss, axonal damage and gliosis.

N2  -  A multispectral (MS) approach that combines apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T-2 parameter maps with k-means (KM) clustering was employed to distinguish multiple compartments within viable tumor tissue (V1 and V2) and necrosis (N1 and N2) following single-dose (1000 cGy) radiotherapy in a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) tumor model. The contributions of cell kill and tumor growth kinetics to the radiotherapy-induced response were investigated. A larger pretreatment V1 volume was correlated with decreased tumor growth delay (TGD) (r = 0.68) and cell kill (r = 0.71). There was no correlation for the pretreatment V2 volume. These results suggest that V1 tissue is well oxygenated and radiosensitive, whereas V2 tissue is hypoxic and therefore radioresistant. The relationship between an early ADC response and vasogenic edema and formation of necrosis was investigated. A trend for increased ADC was observed prior to an increase in the necrotic fraction (NF). Because there were no changes in T-2, these observations suggest that the early increase in ADC is more likely based on a slight reduction in cell density, rather than radiation-induced vasogenic edema. Quantitative assessments of individual tissue regions, tumor growth kinetics, and cell kill should provide a more accurate means of monitoring therapy in preclinical animal models because such assessments can minimize the issue of intertumor variability.

N2  -  In vivo lactate detection using gradient enhanced double quantum coherence transfer (DQCT) was significantly improved by addition of short-time-inversion-recovery (STIR). Phantom studies demonstrated lipid suppression down to the background noise level with 33% loss of lactate signal. In vivo studies using a rabbit model of hypoxic and unilateral-ischemic brain injury showed reduction down to 29 +/- 11% in lipids with inversion times between 140 and 170 ms. Lactate signals on the ischemic side were 51 +/- 53% higher than the nonischemic side at the peak of hypoxia. STIR-DQCT can be a useful robust method of obtaining metabolic maps of lactate in vivo.

N2  -  We propose a method for the automated identification of key white matter fiber tracts for neurosurgical planning, and we apply the method in a retrospective study of 18 consecutive neurosurgical patients with brain tumors. Our method is designed to be relatively robust to challenges in neurosurgical tractography, which include peritumoral edema, displacement, and mass effect caused by mass lesions. The proposed method has two parts. First, we learn a data-driven white matter parcellation or fiber cluster atlas using groupwise registration and spectral clustering of multi-fiber tractography from healthy controls. Key fiber tract clusters are identified in the atlas. Next, patient-specific fiber tracts are automatically identified using tractography-based registration to the atlas and spectral embedding of patient tractography.
Results indicate good generalization of the data-driven atlas to patients: 80% of the 800 fiber clusters were identified in all 18 patients, and 94% of the 800 fiber clusters were found in 16 or more of the 18 patients. Automated subject-specific tract identification was evaluated by quantitative comparison to subject-specific motor and language functional MRI, focusing on the arcuate fasciculus (language) and corticospinal tracts ( motor), which were identified in all patients. Results indicate good colocalization: 89 of 95, or 94%, of patient-specific language and motor activations were intersected by the corresponding identified tract. All patient-specific activations were within 3mm of the corresponding language or motor tract. Overall, our results indicate the potential of an automated method for identifying fiber tracts of interest for neurosurgical planning, even in patients with mass lesions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

N2  -  Introduction: To achieve a maximum extent of resection, intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) scan is frequently performed. Intraoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is not standardly performed and has been described to be inferior to early postoperative MRI regarding the detection of ischemia.Research question: This feasibility study evaluates the detection of ischemia by ioMRI and its clinical relevance in patients with motor-eloquent gliomas.Material and methods: Of 262 glioma patients, eight patients (3.1%) showed an amplitude loss of continuous motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring during resection before the ioMRI scan (group loss of MEP 1/4 LOM). In these patients and a matched-pair cohort (MPC) of glioma resections without MEP loss, we performed additional ioMRI sequences including turbo-spin-echo (TSE)- and echo-planar-imaging (EPI)-DWI and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). The clinical outcome was measured 5 days and 3 months after surgery.Results: The mean & PLUSMN; standard time between loss of MEPs and ioMRI was 63.0 & PLUSMN; 8.7 min (range: 40-84). Ischemia within the motor system could be detected by ioMRI in group LOM in 100% EPI-DWIs, 75% TSE-DWIs, and 66.7% PWIs. No sequence showed motor ischemia in the MPC group. All patients of group LOM and no patient of group MPC suffered from permanent motor deficit.Discussion and conclusion: The current results provide data on the time sequence of ischemia apparent in MRI sequences which is superior to previous data on symptomatic stroke patients on this topic. The early detection of ischemia adds an additional predictor for the long-term outcome of patients and shows the reason of an intraoperative loss of MEPs. Thereby the performance of intraoperative EPI-DWI might be justified after confirmation of the present data in a larger cohort.Subcortical ischemia can be detected by ioMRI after MEP loss during the resection of motor-eloquent gliomas and was clinically relevant in all cases.

N2  -  Objective We recently developed a new subcortical mapping technique based on the concept of stimulating the tissue at the site of and synchronously with resection. Our hypothesis was that instead of performing resection and mapping sequentially, a synchronized resection and mapping could potentially improve deficit rates.
Methods We report our 5-year series of patients who prospectively underwent tumor surgery adjacent to the corticospinal tract (CST) (defined as < 1 cm using diffusion tension imaging and fiber tracking) with simultaneous subcortical short train cathodal monopolar mapping, equipped with a new acoustic motor evoked potential (MEP) alarm. Continuous (temporal coverage) and dynamic (spatial coverage) mapping was realized technically by integrating the mapping probe at the tip of a new suction device. Motor function was assessed using the Medical Research Council scale (from M1 to M5) 1 day after surgery, at discharge, and at 3 months.; Results Technically, the method was successful in all 182 cases. The lowest individual motor thresholds reached during resection were > 10 mA, n = 56; 6-10 mA, n = 31; 4-5 mA, n = 37; and 1-3 mA, n = 58. At 3 months, six patients (3%) had a persisting postoperative motor deficit that was caused by direct mechanical injury in three of these patients (1.7%).; Conclusions Continuous dynamic mapping was found to be a feasible and ergonomic technique for localizing the exact site of the CST and distance to the motor fibers. This new technique may improve the safety of motor eloquent tumor surgery.

N2  -  Purpose: To use normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC) histograms from patients with grade 11 oligodendroglioma (OD) and astrocytoma (AC) to generate RGB color maps that emphasize the differences between normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), oligo-like, and astro-like regions.
Materials and Methods: NAWM and nonenhancing lesion (NEL) ADC values from 19 ODs and 11 ACs were summed to generate oligo-like (red), NAWM (green), and astro-like (blue) nADC histograms. These nADC histograms were then used to map nADC values to an RGB matrix.; Results: Color maps of oligodendroglial tumor regions were generally visualized in pink, while color maps of astrocytic tumor regions showed various shades of blue. This technique was also applied to 23 patients with the more mixed subtype, oligoastrocytoma (OA). which showed a mixture of both blue and pink, which in many cases appeared to bleed into each other and were blotchy.; Conclusion: This technique allows for the visualization of biologically different regions within the whole tumor mass, which may aid in directing image-guided biopsies. This can be used to ensure that the biopsy is directed to regions that can more accurately define the dominant tumor characteristics.

N2  -  A treatment planning system for stereotactical neurosurgery has been developed. A modular system has been designed which is readily extendable. Different modalities of tomography (CT, MRI) can be correlated and presented simultaneously in transverse, frontal and sagittal reconstructions. The volumes of interest are segmented with respect to the different modalities, and the positions of the catheters are defined. The calculation of dose must be adapted to the physical requirements of the therapy and is designed as an independent process. The calculated data are shown in various presentations. The treatment planning system is applied to intratumoral chemotherapy. The drug is encapsulated in small carriers for prolonged release and injected via catheters directly into the tumor interstitium, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. The dose is calculated using the time-dependent, three-dimensional finite elements method. To achieve homogeneous temporal and spatial drug distribution it is necessary to use a great number of catheters due to the limited diffusion of drug, which is not practical in neurosurgery. Therefore this therapy concept is useful for small volumes only. Interstitial hyperthermia and brachytherapy, in contrast to intratumoral chemotherapy, show successful clinical results.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Lesions in the thalamomesencephalic junction can be reached via an anterolateral approach, interhemispheric approach, transcortical (parieto-occipital lobule) approach, subtemporal approach, supracerebellar approaches, or transsylvian-insular approach. We now describe a new approach, a transanterior perforating Substance approach, to this territory.
METHODS: A 33-year-old man with progressive right arm tremors, mild hemiparesis, and a cavernous malformation of the thalamomesencephalic junction was followed for 5 years. Because of clinical progression, lie underwent a left orbitozygomatic approach to the cavernous malformation, which could not be accessed because of a high-riding basilar artery. Hence, a new transsylvian corridor of exposure was developed using frameless neuronavigation. The trajectory, which was dorsal to M1, led through the perforating branches of M1. Care was taken to avoid violating any arterial perforators. To reach the lesion, a small opening into the brain was created near the optic tract.; RESULTS: The cavernous malformation was resected totally. Postoperatively, the patient's tremors were cured. No visual deficits were encountered. Imaging showed a small ischemic stroke in the basal ganglia likely related to manipulation of a perforator. Initially, his hemiparesis worsened, but it improved significantly within 10 months with only a moderate decrease in strength.; CONCLUSION: The transanterior perforating substance approach effectively allowed access to the thalamomesencephalic junction and was associated with significant morbidity. However, the safety of the approach needs further validation. Neuronavigation is indicated to choose the most direct trajectory through the M1 perforators. Tractography may help protect the optic tract.

N2  -  In malignant primary brain tumors, cancer cells infiltrate into the peritumoral brain structures which results in inevitable recurrence. Quantitative assessment of infiltrative heterogeneity in the peritumoral region, the area where biopsy or resection can be hazardous, is important for clinical decision making. Here, we derive a novel set of Artificial intelligence (AI)-based markers capturing the heterogeneity of tumor infiltration, by characterizing free water movement restriction in the peritumoral region using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-based free water volume fraction maps. We leverage the differences in the peritumoral region of metastasis and glioblastomas, the former consisting of vasogenic versus the latter containing infiltrative edema, to extract a voxel-wise deep learning-based peritumoral microenvironment index (PMI). Descriptive characteristics of locoregional hubs of uniformly high PMI values are then extracted as AI-based markers to capture distinct aspects of infiltrative heterogeneity. The proposed markers are utilized to stratify patients' survival and IDH1 mutation status on a population of 275 adult-type diffuse gliomas (CNS WHO grade 4). Our results show significant differences in the proposed markers between patients with different overall survival and IDH1 mutation status (t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, linear regression; p < 0.01). Clustering of patients using the proposed markers reveals distinct survival groups (logrank; p < 10(-5), Cox hazard ratio = 1.82; p < 0.005). Our findings provide a panel of markers as surrogates of infiltration that might capture novel insight about underlying biology of peritumoral microstructural heterogeneity, providing potential biomarkers of prognosis pertaining to survival and molecular stratification, with applicability in clinical decision making.

N2  -  Malignant behaviors of brain gliomas include proliferation and infiltration. It remains unclear which behavior influences the status of adjacent corticospinal tracts. Diffusion tensor imaging can show the status of brain white matter fiber tracts. Ki-67 and CD44/matrix metalloproteinase 9 are sensitive markers for reflecting the proliferation and infiltration of tumor cells. The present study analyzed pre-operative diffusion tensor images of 24 patients with pathologically confirmed World Health Organization glioma (I-IV). We observed lapse, infiltration and destruction of the pen-tumor corticospinal tract following reconstruction, and simultaneously detected the expression of Ki-67, CD44/matrix metalloproteinase 9 in samples. Expression of CD44 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 was not significantly correlated to the status of the pen-tumor corticospinal tract (r = 1.597, 4.859; P = 0.450, 0.088), while Ki-67 expression significantly correlated to its status (r = 6.590, P = 0.037). These findings demonstrate that highly proliferative gliomas result in damage to the peripheral corticospinal tract.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Electrocortical stimulation (ECS) is the gold standard for functional brain mapping; however, precise functional mapping is still difficult in patients with language deficits. High gamma activity (HGA) between 80 and 140 Hz on electrocorticography is assumed to reflect localized cortical processing, whereas the cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) can reflect bidirectional responses evoked by monophasic pulse stimuli to the language cortices when there is no patient cooperation. The authors propose the use of "passive" mapping by combining HGA mapping and CCEP recording without active tasks during conscious resections of brain tumors.
METHODS Five patients, each with an intraaxial tumor in their dominant hemisphere, underwent conscious resection of their lesion with passive mapping. The authors performed functional localization for the receptive language area, using real-time HGA mapping, by listening passively to linguistic sounds. Furthermore, single electrical pulses were delivered to the identified receptive temporal language area to detect CCEPs in the frontal lobe. All mapping results were validated by ECS, and the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated.; RESULTS Linguistic HGA mapping quickly identified the language area in the temporal lobe. Electrical stimulation by linguistic HGA mapping to the identified temporal receptive language area evoked CCEPs on the frontal lobe. The combination of linguistic HGA and frontal CCEPs needed no patient cooperation or effort. In this small case series, the sensitivity and specificity were 93.8% and 89%, respectively.; CONCLUSIONS The described technique allows for simple and quick functional brain mapping with higher sensitivity and specificity than ECS mapping. The authors believe that this could improve the reliability of functional brain mapping and facilitate rational and objective operations. Passive mapping also sheds light on the underlying physiological mechanisms of language in the human brain.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The accurate delineation of tumor recurrence presents a significant problem in neuro-oncology. Our aim was to improve the identification of brain tumor recurrence from chemoradiation injury by using CE-SWI, a technique that provides improved visualization of the heterogeneous patterns of brain tumor pathology, to guide the analysis of ADC measures within the peritumoral territory.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients who were being treated for high-grade glial neoplasms took part in the study. All patients presented with new enhancing lesions on follow-up CE-T1. Recurrence or chemoradiation injury was confirmed from either histologic analysis or extensive clinical follow-up. Regions of enhancement on registered CE-SWI and CE-T1 images were extracted in a semiautomated fashion and transferred to coregistered ADC maps. Significant differences in ADC measures defined within the enhancement volumes on serial MR images were analyzed by using a nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov approach and correlated with clinical follow-up diagnoses.; RESULTS: Analysis of the serial data revealed that patients with a diagnosis of tumor recurrence had significantly reduced ADC measures within the enhancement volume delineated on CE-SWI. In contrast, patients with SD had significantly elevated ADC within the CE-SWI enhancement volume.; CONCLUSIONS: The findings of an increase in enhancement volume delineated on serial CE-SWI maps, along with a concomitant reduction in ADC within this volume for patients with recurrent tumor, provide support for such an approach to be used to assist in follow-up patient management strategies.

N2  -  Neuroscience has a long history of inferring brain function by examining the relationship between brain injury and subsequent behavioral impairments. The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications.

N2  -  Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) allows the estimation of pretreatment ischemic core after acute ischemic stroke. However, CTP-derived ischemic core may overestimate final infarct volume. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of CTP-derived ischemic core for the prediction of final infarct volume according to time from stroke onset to recanalization in 104 patients achieving complete recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy who had a pretreatment CTP and a 24-h follow-up MRI-DWI. A range of CTP thresholds was explored in perfusion maps at constant increments for ischemic core calculation. Time to recanalization modified significantly the association between ischemic core and DWI lesion in a non-linear fashion (p-interaction = 0.018). Patients with recanalization before 4.5 h had significantly lower intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values between CTP-predicted ischemic core and DWI lesion (n = 54; best threshold relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) < 25%, ICC = 0.673, 95% CI = 0.495-0.797) than those with later recanalization (n = 50; best threshold rCBF < 30%, ICC = 0.887, 95% CI = 0.811-0.935, p = 0.013), as well as poorer spatial lesion agreement. The significance of the associations between CTP-derived ischemic core and clinical outcome at 90 days was lost in patients recanalized before 4.5 h. CTP-derived ischemic core must be interpreted with caution given its dependency on time to recanalization, primarily in patients with higher chances of early recanalization.

N2  -  Multiple etiologies can coexist and trigger CNS symptoms in individuals infected with HIV. This article reviews a case of a cerebellar mass in an HIV patient who, on biopsy, grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and by pathology, showed an atypical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate concerning a clonal lymphoproliferative process, which may be a precursor of CNS lymphoma. The patient, a 36-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HIV Infection, presented to the hospital for evaluation of a one-week course of headache and photophobia. Remarkable physical examination findings included dilated pupils and anisocoria. Initial CT brain imaging revealed vasogenic edema seen throughout the left cerebellar hemisphere provoking mass effect on the fourth ventricle and pontocerebellar cistern resulting in mild hydrocephalus, new findings compared to prior. MRI brain displayed a T1 isointense, T2 hypointense ring-enhancing lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with restricted diffusion, and surrounding vasogenic edema resulting in mass effect over the fourth ventricle, left cerebellar peduncle, and pontocerebellar cistern causing mild hydrocephalus. The patient underwent left suboccipital craniotomy with evacuation of the cerebellar lesion by neurosurgery. Tissue cultures grew MRSA. Pathology was sent to New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center due to the presence of atypical lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. The final diagnosis was polyclonal B-cell population in the sample; however, prominent peaks were also seen above the polyclonal background, possibly representing a clonal proliferation. Therefore, the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates remained atypical and the possibility of the underlying clonal lymphoproliferative process could not be entirely ruled out.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No report has been published on the use of DSC MR imaging, DCE MR imaging, and DWI parameters in combination to create a prognostic prediction model in glioblastoma patients. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning?based model to find preoperative multiparametric MR imaging parameters associated with prognosis in patients with glioblastoma. Normalized CBV, volume transfer constant, and ADC of the nonenhancing T2 high-signal-intensity lesions were evaluated using K-means clustering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 142 patients with glioblastoma who underwent preoperative MR imaging and total resection were included in this retrospective study. From the normalized CBV, volume transfer constant, and ADC maps, the parametric data were sorted using the K-means clustering method. Patients were divided into training and test sets (ratio, 1:1), and the optimal number of clusters was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were performed to identify potential parametric predictors. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was conducted to adjust for clinical predictors. RESULTS: The nonenhancing T2 high-signal-intensity lesions were divided into 6 clusters. The cluster (class 4) with the relatively low normalized CBV and volume transfer constant value and the lowest ADC values was most associated with predicting glioblastoma prognosis. The optimal cutoff of the class 4 volume fraction of nonenhancing T2 high-signal-intensity lesions predicting 1-year progression-free survival was 9.70%, below which the cutoff was associated with longer progression-free survival. Two Kaplan-Meier curves based on the cutoff value showed a statistically significant difference (P = .037). When we adjusted for all clinical predictors, the cluster with the relatively low normalized CBV and volume transfer constant values and the lowest ADC value was an independent prognostic marker (hazard ratio, 3.04; P = .048). The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed a concordance index of 0.699 for progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our model showed that nonenhancing T2 high-signal-intensity lesions with the relatively low normalized CBV, low volume transfer constant values, and the lowest ADC values could serve as useful prognostic imaging markers for predicting survival outcomes in patients with glioblastoma.

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High b-value DWI has been expected to have an additional diagnostic role and demonstrated some promising results in head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DWI at a high b-value (b=2000 s/mm(2)) compared with a standard b-value (b=1000 s/mm(2)) and the ratio of ADC values of high and standard b-values for their ability to differentiate between recurrent tumor and posttreatment changes after the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in the present study; all had contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up MR imaging. All patients underwent single-shot echo-planar DWI at b=1000 smm(2) and b=2000 smm(2), and corresponding ADC maps were generated (ADC(1000) and ADC(2000), respectively). The mean ADC(1000), ADC(2000), and ADC(ratio) (ADC(ratio) = ADC(2000)ADC(1000) x 100) values were evaluated within a manually placed ROI with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as references. For the statistical analysis, we performed a Student t test and multivariate logistic regression.; RESULTS: The mean ADC(1000) in recurrent tumor was significantly lower than that in posttreatment changes (P < .001), whereas the mean ADC(2000) resulted in no significant difference (P = .365). The mean ADC(ratio) was significantly higher in recurrent tumor than that in posttreatment changes (73.5 +- 7.2% vs 56.9 +- 8.8%, respectively; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the ADC(ratio) was the only independently differentiating variable (P = .024). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ADC(ratio) were 95.0%, 69.2%, and 84.8%, respectively, by use of the optimal cutoff value of 62.6%.; CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the ADC(ratio) calculated from the ADC(1000) and ADC(2000) is a promising value for the differentiation of recurrent tumor and posttreatment changes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

N2  -  Background and Objectives<br /> In patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), thalamic atrophy occurs during the disease course. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms leading to volume loss and of the relationship between microstructural thalamic pathology and disease progression. This cross-sectional and longitudinal study aimed to comprehensively characterize in vivo pathologic changes within thalamic microstructure in PwMS using advanced multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI). Methods<br /> Thalamic microstructural integrity was evaluated using quantitative T1, magnetization transfer saturation, multishell diffusion, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in 183 PwMS and 105 healthy controls (HCs). The same qMRI protocol was available for 127 PwMS and 73 HCs after a 2-year follow-up period. Inclusion criteria for PwMS encompassed either an active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or inactive progressive MS (PMS) disease course. Thalamic alterations were compared between PwMS and HCs and among disease phenotypes. In addition, the study investigated the relationship between thalamic damage and clinical and conventional MRI measures of disease severity. Results<br /> Compared with HCs, PwMS exhibited substantial thalamic alterations, indicative of microstructural and macrostructural damage, demyelination, and disruption in iron homeostasis. These alterations extended beyond focal thalamic lesions, affecting normal-appearing thalamic tissue diffusely. Over the follow-up period, PwMS displayed an accelerated decrease in myelin volume fraction [mean difference in annualized percentage change (MD-ApC) = -1.50; p = 0.041] and increase in quantitative T1 (MD-ApC = 0.92; p < 0.0001) values, indicating heightened demyelinating and neurodegenerative processes. The observed differences between PwMS and HCs were substantially driven by the subgroup with PMS, wherein thalamic degeneration was significantly accelerated, even in comparison with patients with RRMS. Thalamic qMRI alterations showed extensive correlations with conventional MRI, clinical, and cognitive disease burden measures. Disability progression over follow-up was associated with accelerated thalamic degeneration, as reflected by enhanced diffusion (beta = -0.067; p = 0.039) and QSM (beta = -0.077; p = 0.027) changes. Thalamic qMRI metrics emerged as significant predictors of neurologic and cognitive disability even when accounting for other established markers including white matter lesion load and brain and thalamic atrophy. Discussion These findings offer deeper insights into thalamic pathology in PwMS, emphasizing the clinical relevance of thalamic damage and its link to disease progression. Advanced qMRI biomarkers show promising potential in guiding interventions aimed at mitigating thalamic neurodegenerative processes.

N2  -  Introduction: Vertigo and dizziness are common neurological symptoms in general practice. Most patients have benign peripheral vestibular disorders, but some have dangerous central causes. Recent research has shown that bedside oculomotor examinations accurately discriminate central from peripheral lesions in those with new, acute, continuous vertigo/dizziness with nausea/vomiting, gait unsteadiness, and nystagmus, known as the acute vestibular syndrome.
Case Report: A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute vestibular syndrome for 1 week. The patient had no focal neurological symptoms or signs. The presence of direction-fixed, horizontal nystagmus suppressed by visual fixation without vertical ocular misalignment (skew deviation) was consistent with an acute peripheral vestibulopathy, but bilaterally normal vestibuloocular reflexes, confirmed by quantitative horizontal head impulse testing, strongly indicated a central localization. Because of a long delay in care, the patient left the emergency department without treatment. He returned 1 week later with progressive gait disturbance, limb ataxia, myoclonus, and new cognitive deficits. His subsequent course included a rapid neurological decline culminating in home hospice placement and death within 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed restricted diffusion involving the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Spinal fluid 14-3-3 protein was elevated. The rapidly progressive clinical course with dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus plus corroborative neuroimaging and spinal fluid findings confirmed a clinicoradiographic diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.; Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an initial presentation of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease closely mimicking vestibular neuritis, expanding the known clinical spectrum of prion disease presentations. Despite the initial absence of neurological signs, the central lesion location was differentiated from a benign peripheral vestibulopathy at the first visit using simple bedside vestibular tests. Familiarity with these tests could help providers prevent initial misdiagnosis of important central disorders in patients presenting vertigo or dizziness.

N2  -  To examine the impact of denoising on ultra-low-dose volume perfusion CT (ULD-VPCT) imaging in acute stroke.
Simulated ULD-VPCT data sets at 20 % dose rate were generated from perfusion data sets of 20 patients with suspected ischemic stroke acquired at 80 kVp180 mAs. Four data sets were generated from each ULD-VPCT data set: not-denoised (ND); denoised using spatiotemporal filter (D1); denoised using quanta-stream diffusion technique (D2); combination of both methods (D1 + D2). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured in the resulting 100 data sets. Image quality, presenceabsence of ischemic lesions, CBV and CBF scores according to a modified ASPECTS score were assessed by two blinded readers.; SNR and qualitative scores were highest for D1 + D2 and lowest for ND (all p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001). In 25 % of the patients, ND maps were not assessable and therefore excluded from further analyses. Compared to original data sets, in D2 and D1 + D2, readers correctly identified all patients with ischemic lesions (sensitivity 1.0, kappa 1.0). Lesion size was most accurately estimated for D1 + D2 with a sensitivity of 1.0 (CBV) and 0.94 (CBF) and an inter-rater agreement of 1.0 and 0.92, respectively.; An appropriate combination of denoising techniques applied in ULD-VPCT produces diagnostically sufficient perfusion maps at substantially reduced dose rates as low as 20 % of the normal scan.; aEuro cent Perfusion-CT is an accurate tool for the detection of brain ischemias.; aEuro cent The high associated radiation doses are a major drawback of brain perfusion CT.; aEuro cent Decreasing tube current in perfusion CT increases image noise and deteriorates image quality.; aEuro cent Combination of different image-denoising techniques produces sufficient image quality from ultra-low-dose perfusion CT.

N2  -  BackgroundThe Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is most frequently used to test processing speed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Functional imaging studies emphasize the importance of frontal and parietal areas for task performance, but the influence of frontoparietal tracts has not been thoroughly studied. We were interested in tract-specific characteristics and their association with processing speed in MS patients. MethodsDiffusion tensor imaging was obtained in 100 MS patients and 24 healthy matched controls to compare seed-based tract characteristics descending from the superior parietal lobule [Brodman area 7A (BA7A)], atlas-based tract characteristics from the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and control tract characteristics from the corticospinal tract (CST) and their respective association with ability on the SDMT. ResultsPatients had decreased performance on the SDMT and decreased white matter volume (each p < 0.05). The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for the BA7A tract and CST (p < 0.05), but not the SLF, differed between MS patients and controls. Furthermore, only the FA of the SLF was positively associated with SDMT performance even after exclusion of the lesions within the tract (r = 0.25, p < 0.05). However, only disease disability and total white matter volume were associated with information processing speed in a linear regression model. ConclusionsProcessing speed in MS is associated with the structural integrity of frontoparietal white matter tracts.

N2  -  Objective: In image-guided neurosurgery, co-registered preoperative anatomical, functional, and diffusion tensor imaging can be used to facilitate a safe resection of brain tumors in eloquent areas of the brain. However, the brain deforms during surgery, particularly in the presence of tumor resection. Non-Rigid Registration (NRR) of the preoperative image data can be used to create a registered image that captures the deformation in the intraoperative image while maintaining the quality of the preoperative image. Using clinical data, this paper reports the results of a comparison of the accuracy and performance among several non-rigid registration methods for handling brain deformation. A new adaptive method that automatically removes mesh elements in the area of the resected tumor, thereby handling deformation in the presence of resection is presented. To improve the user experience, we also present a new way of using mixed reality with ultrasound, MRI, and CT.Materials and methods: This study focuses on 30 glioma surgeries performed at two different hospitals, many of which involved the resection of significant tumor volumes. An Adaptive Physics-Based Non-Rigid Registration method (A-PBNRR) registers preoperative and intraoperative MRI for each patient. The results are compared with three other readily available registration methods: a rigid registration implemented in 3D Slicer v4.4.0; a B-Spline non-rigid registration implemented in 3D Slicer v4.4.0; and PBNRR implemented in ITKv4.7.0, upon which A-PBNRR was based. Three measures were employed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the registration accuracy: (i) visual assessment, (ii) a Hausdorff Distance-based metric, and (iii) a landmark-based approach using anatomical points identified by a neurosurgeon.Results: The A-PBNRR using multi-tissue mesh adaptation improved the accuracy of deformable registration by more than five times compared to rigid and traditional physics based non-rigid registration, and four times compared to B-Spline interpolation methods which are part of ITK and 3D Slicer. Performance analysis showed that A-PBNRR could be applied, on average, in <2 min, achieving desirable speed for use in a clinical setting.Conclusions: The A-PBNRR method performed significantly better than other readily available registration methods at modeling deformation in the presence of resection. Both the registration accuracy and performance proved sufficient to be of clinical value in the operating room. A-PBNRR, coupled with the mixed reality system, presents a powerful and affordable solution compared to current neuronavigation systems.

N2  -  In unconscious appearing patients with acute brain injury, wilful brain activation to motor commands without behavioural signs of command following, known as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is associated with functional recovery. CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown.
By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T-2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively.; Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006, but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9 and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5).; These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection. These data may allow screening for CMD based on widely available structural MRI and resting EEG.

N2  -  Glioma resection within language-eloquent regions poses a high risk of surgery-related aphasia (SRA). Preoperative functional mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly used to localize cortical and subcortical language-eloquent areas. This study enrolled 60 nonaphasic patients with left hemispheric perisylvian gliomas to investigate the prediction of SRA based on function-specific connectome network properties under different fractional anisotropy (FA) thresholds. Moreover, we applied a machine learning model for training and cross-validation to predict SRA based on preoperative connectome parameters. Preoperative connectome analysis helps predict SRA development with an accuracy of 73.3% and sensitivity of 78.3%. The current study provides a new perspective of combining nTMS and function-specific connectome analysis applied in a machine learning model to investigate language in neurooncological patients and promises to advance our understanding of the intricate networks.

N2  -  Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of gross total resection in improving patient survival in glioblastoma (GBM). Advances in surgical tools and techniques such as intra-operative imaging, fluorescent agents, and functional imaging sequences are allowing for better identification of tumor borders and vital eloquent cortex in order to safely achieve higher rates of complete resections. Furthermore, due to the limits of surgical resection alone, new minimally invasive techniques for treatment of GBM are under development. These advances are crucial for improving neurosurgical care and outcomes in this difficult patient population.

N2  -  In early studies interoception strictly referred to the awareness of visceral sensations, but recent theories have expanded this concept to denote the ongoing status of the body, including somatosensory feelings. Here, we integrated data from normal and pathological functioning to disclose neural underpinnings of interoceptive sensibility, taking into account the crucial distinction between visceral and somatosensory feelings. Twenty-seven healthy young individuals underwent structural MRI (including T1w images and DTI). Voxel-wise ana-lyses of the gyrification index (GI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) data were performed to assess the relation between interoceptive sensibility and surface morphometry and anatomical connectivity. Thirty-three unilateral brain-damaged patients took part in this study for Voxel-Based Lesion-Symptom Mapping (VLSM) and track-wise hodological lesion-deficit analysis (TWH). All participants completed the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (SAQ), a self-report tool assessing interoceptive sensibility of visceral (F1) and somatosensory feelings (F2). Tract-Based Spatial Statistics showed that F2 was positively associated with FA in the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, cingulum, forceps, inferior longitudinal, fronto-occipital, superior longitudinal, and uncinate fasciculi; no significant association was detected for F1. However, F1 was positively associated with GI in the left anterior cingulate cortex. VLSM showed that F1 mainly relies on the right posterior insula, whereas F2 is related mostly to subcortical nuclei and surrounding white matter in the right hemisphere. Accordingly, patients with disconnection of the anterior thalamic projection, corticospinal tract, inferior fronto-occipital, inferior longitu-dinal, uncinate and superior longitudinal fasciculus III showed lower scores on F2. Overall, results support the dissociation between interoceptive sensibility of visceral and somatosensory feelings.

N2  -  Purpose: To assess the value of histogram analysis, using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), in differentiating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from single brain metastasis (SBM) and to compare the diagnostic efficiency of different region of interest (ROI) placements.
Method: Sixty-seven patients with histologically confirmed GBM (n = 35) and SBM (n = 32) were recruited. Two ROIs-the contrast-enhanced area and whole-tumor area-were delineated across all slices. Eleven histogram parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) from both ROIs were calculated. All histogram parameter values were compared between GBM and SBM, using the Mann-Whitney U test. The accuracies of different histogram parameters were compared using the McNemar test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to assess the diagnostic performance.; Results: In the contrast-enhanced area, FA(10), FA(25), FA(75), FA(90), FA(mean), FA(median), FA(max), MDmax, MDskewness, and MKskewness were significantly higher for GBM than for SBM. FA(skewness) was significantly lower for GBM than for SBM. FA(25) (0.815) had the highest area under the curve (AUC). In the whole-tumor area, FA(10), FA(25), FA(75), FA(90), FASD, FA(mean), FA(median), FA(max), MDmax, MDskewness, and MKskewness were significantly higher for GBM than for SBM. FA(median) (0.805) had the highest AUC. The accuracy of FA(25) in the contrast-enhanced area was significantly higher than that of the FA(median) in the whole-tumor area.; Conclusions: GBM and SBM can be differentiated using the DKI-based histogram analysis. Placing the ROI on the contrast-enhanced area results in better discrimination.

N2  -  Cortical demyelination occurs early in multiple sclerosis (MS) and relates to disease outcome. The brain cortex has endogenous propensity for remyelination as proven from histopathology study. In this study, we aimed at characterizing cortical microstructural abnormalities related to myelin content by applying a novel quantitative MRI technique in early MS. A combined myelin estimation (CME) cortical map was obtained from quantitative 7-Tesla (7T) T-2* and T-1 acquisitions in 25 patients with early MS and 19 healthy volunteers. Cortical lesions in MS patients were classified based on their myelin content by comparison with CME values in healthy controls as demyelinated, partially demyelinated, or non-demyelinated. At follow-up, we registered changes in cortical lesions as increased, decreased, or stable CME. Vertex-wise analysis compared cortical CME in the normal-appearing cortex in 25 MS patients vs. 19 healthy controls at baseline and investigated longitudinal changes at 1 year in 10 MS patients. Measurements from the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) diffusion model were obtained to account for cortical neurite/dendrite loss at baseline and follow-up. Finally, CME maps were correlated with clinical metrics. CME was overall low in cortical lesions (p = 0.03) and several normal-appearing cortical areas (p < 0.05) in the absence of NODDI abnormalities. Individual cortical lesion analysis revealed, however, heterogeneous CME patterns from extensive to partial or absent demyelination. At follow-up, CME overall decreased in cortical lesions and non-lesioned cortex, with few areas showing an increase (p < 0.05). Cortical CME maps correlated with processing speed in several areas across the cortex. In conclusion, CME allows detection of cortical microstructural changes related to coexisting demyelination and remyelination since the early phases of MS, and shows to be more sensitive than NODDI and relates to cognitive performance.

N2  -  Object. Several studies have revealed that the gross-total resection (GTR) of malignant brain tumors has a significant influence on patient survival. Frequently, however, GTR cannot be achieved because the borders between healthy brain and diseased tissue are blurred in the infiltration zones of malignant brain tumors. Especially in eloquent cortical areas, resection is frequently stopped before total removal is achieved to avoid causing neurological deficits. Interestingly, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has been shown to help visualize tumor tissue intraoperatively and, thus, can significantly improve the possibility of achieving GTR of primary malignant brain tumors. The aim of this study was to go one step further and evaluate the utility and limitations of fluorescence-guided resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent cortical areas in combination with intraoperative monitoring based on multimodal functional imaging data.
Methods. Eighteen patients with primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas were included in this prospective study. Preoperative neuroradiological examinations included MR imaging with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), functional MR, and diffusion tensor imaging sequences to visualize functional areas and fiber tracts. Imaging data were analyzed offline, loaded into a neuronavigational system, and used intraoperatively during resections. All patients received 5-ALA 6 hours before surgery. Fluorescence-guided tumor resections were combined with intraoperative monitoring and cortical as well as subcortical stimulation to localize functional areas and fiber tracts during surgery.; Results. Twenty-five procedures were performed in 18 consecutive patients. In 24% of all surgeries, resection was stopped because a functional area or cortical tract was identified in the resection area or because motor evoked potential amplitudes were reduced in an area where fluorescent tumor cells were still seen intraoperatively. Gross-total resection could be achieved in 16 (64%) of the surgeries with preservation of all functional areas and fiber tracts. In 2 patients presurgical hemiparesis became accentuated postoperatively, and 1 of these patients also suffered from a new homonymous hemianopia following a second resection.; Conclusions. The authors' first results show that tumor resections with 5-ALA in combination with intraoperative cortical stimulation have the advantages of both methods and, thus, provide additional safety for the neurosurgeon during resections of primary malignant brain tumors in eloquent areas. Nonetheless, more cases and additional studies are necessary to further prove the advantages of this multimodal strategy. (DOI: 10.31712009.10.JNS09447 )

N2  -  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differentiation of abscesses from glioblastomas and metastases may not always be possible on the basis of DWI. Our hypothesis was that differences in diffusion properties as detected by DTI allow differentiation of abscess from glioblastomas and metastasis. Furthermore, diagnostic performance of tensor metrics quantifying anisotropy or tensor shapes is better than that of ADC in measuring mean diffusivity for this purpose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 15 abscesses, 15 necrotic glioblastomas, and 26 cystic metastases. In each lesion, manually segmented into 4 regions of interest (ie, cystic cavity, enhancing rim, and immediate edema most adjacent to the enhancing rim and distant zones of edema), FA, ADC, C(l), C(p), and C(s) values were measured and statistically compared among groups and evaluated with ROC curve analysis. The presence of a hyperintense FA rim (a rim of edematous tissue that was hyperintense on the FA map) was assessed visually.; RESULTS: Abscess was significantly different from glioblastoma for all tensor metrics measured in the cystic cavity and immediate zone of edema and for all except C(l) in the enhancing rim. Abscess was significantly different from metastasis for all tensor metrics measured in the cystic cavity and enhancing rim and for FA, ADC, and C(l) in immediate zone of edema. The incidence of a hyperintense FA rim was significantly higher in glioblastoma and metastasis compared with abscess. The 3 tensor metrics with the highest performance in differentiating abscess from glioblastoma and metastasis were FA, C(l), and C(s) of the cystic cavity.; CONCLUSIONS: DTI is able to differentiate abscess from glioblastoma and metastasis. FA, C(l), and C(s) outperformed ADC in diagnostic performance comparisons.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE Resection of intraaxial tumors adjacent to the optic radiation (OR) may be associated with postoperative visual field (VF) deficits. Intraoperative navigation using MRI-based tractography and electrophysiological monitoring of the visual pathways may allow maximal resection while preserving visual function. In this study, the authors evaluated the value of visual pathway mapping in a series of patients undergoing awake craniotomy for tumor resection.
METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted in 18 patients who underwent an awake craniotomy for resection of intraaxial tumors involving or adjacent to the OR. Preoperative MRI-based tractography was used for intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative acquisition of 3D ultrasonography images was performed for real-time imaging and correction of brain shift. Goggles with light-emitting diodes were used as a standard visual stimulus. Direct cortical visual evoked potential (VEP) recording, subcortical recordings from the OR, and subcortical stimulation of the OR were used intraoperatively to assess visual function and proximity of the lesion to the OR. VFs were assessed pre- and postoperatively.; RESULTS Baseline cortical VEP recordings were available for 14 patients (77.7%). No association was found between preoperative VF status and baseline presence of cortical VEPs (p = 0.27). Five of the 14 patients (35.7%) who underwent subcortical stimulation of the OR reported seeing phosphenes in the corresponding contralateral VF. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.899, p = 0.04) between the subcortical threshold stimulation intensity (3-11.5 mA) and the distance from the OR. Subcortical recordings from the OR demonstrated a typical VEP waveform in 10 of the 13 evaluated patients (76.9%). These waveforms were present only when recordings were obtained within 10 mm of the OR (p = 0.04). Seven patients (38.9%) had postoperative VF deterioration, and it was associated with a length of < 8 mm between the tumor and the OR (p = 0.05).; CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring of the visual pathways is feasible but may be of limited value in preserving the functional integrity of the posterior visual pathways. Subcortical stimulation of the OR may identify the location of the OR when done in proximity to the pathways, but such proximity may be associated with increased risk of postoperative worsening of the VF deficit.

N2  -  Purpose: Temporal evolution of the water apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) parallel (ADC parallel to) and perpendicular (ADC) to the human white matter tract following ischemia has not been investigated systematically. We attempted to quantify the evolution of ADC parallel to and ADC perpendicular to and examine whether it can be interpreted by a model of ischemic edema.
Methods: We retrospectively selected 53 patients with ischemic lesions involving the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and placed regions of interest in the right and left PLIC on ADC maps. We performed regression analysis of lesion-to-contralateral ratios of ADC parallel to and ADC perpendicular to against the time (t=1-1600 h) from onset. We then fitted the estimated time courses of ADC parallel to and ADC perpendicular to obtained from the analysis to a model of nerve tissue composed of cylinders (axons) and spheres corresponding to isotropic structures, particularly focal cytoplasmic swellings of glial cells and axons seen in ischemic white matter.; Results: The evolution of ADC perpendicular to and ADC parallel to differed. The estimated time course of ADC parallel to in mu m(2) . ms(-1) was 0.64 + 0.88 exp (-0.24t) for 1 < t < 54 h and 0.00059t + 0.61 for 54 h (contralateral normal value, 1.52). That of ADC perpendicular to was 0.19 - 0.063 exp (-0.24t) for 1 < t < 54 h and 0.00040t + 0.17 for t >= 54 h (normal value 0.22). The model fitted to these values showed that the volume of the cylinders decreased, that of the spheres increased, and extracellular volume changed little from one hour to approximately one day after stroke onset.; Conclusion: In the human PLIC, ADC parallel to continued to decrease from one hour to a few days after stroke onset, and ADC perpendicular to tended to increase. The temporal evolution could be interpreted by progression of the focal cytoplasmic swelling of glial cells and axons previously observed in animal studies.

N2  -  The first therapeutical goal followed by neurooncological surgeons dealing with prefrontal gliomas is attempting supramarginal tumor resection preserving relevant neurological function. Therefore, advanced knowledge of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) functional neuroanatomy in high-order cognitive domains beyond language and speech processing would help refine neurosurgeries, predicting possible relevant cognitive adverse events and maximizing the surgical efficacy. To this aim we performed the recently developed correlational tractography analyses to evaluate the possible relationship between FAT's microstructural properties and cognitive functions in 27 healthy subjects having ultra-high-field (7-Tesla) diffusion MRI. We independently assessed FAT segments innervating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC-FAT) and the supplementary motor area (SMA-FAT). FAT microstructural robustness, measured by the tract's quantitative anisotropy (QA), was associated with a better performance in episodic memory, visuospatial orientation, cognitive processing speed and fluid intelligence but not sustained selective attention tests. Overall, the percentual tract volume showing an association between QA-index and improved cognitive scores (pQACV) was higher in the SMA-FAT compared to the dlPFC-FAT segment. This effect was right-lateralized for verbal episodic memory and fluid intelligence and bilateralized for visuospatial orientation and cognitive processing speed. Our results provide novel evidence for a functional specialization of the FAT beyond the known in language and speech processing, particularly its involvement in several higher-order cognitive domains. In light of these findings, further research should be encouraged to focus on neurocognitive deficits and their impact on patient outcomes after FAT damage, especially in the context of glioma surgery.

N2  -  The ability to recognize, create, and use complex tools is a milestone in human evolution. Widely distributed brain regions in parietal, frontal, and temporal cortices have been implicated in using and understanding tools, but the roles of their anatomical connections in supporting tool use and tool conceptual behaviors are unclear. Using deterministic fiber tracking in healthy participants, we first examined how 14 cortical regions that are consistently activated by tool processing are connected by white matter (WM) tracts. The relationship between the integrity of each of the 33 obtained tracts and tool processing deficits across 86 brain-damaged patients was investigated. WM tract integrity was measured with both lesion percentage (structural imaging) and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (diffusion imaging). Behavioral abilities were assessed by a tool use task, a range of conceptual tasks, and control tasks. We found that three left hemisphere tracts connecting frontoparietal and intrafrontal areas overlapping with left superior longitudinal fasciculus are crucial for tool use such that larger lesion and lower mean FA values on these tracts were associated with more severe tool use deficits. These tracts and five additional left hemisphere tracts connecting frontal and temporal/parietal regions, mainly overlapping with left superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation, are crucial for tool concept processing. Largely consistent results were also obtained using voxel-based symptom mapping analyses. Our results revealed the WM structural networks that support the use and conceptual understanding of tools, providing evidence for the anatomical skeleton of the tool knowledge network.

N2  -  For the navigation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), various techniques are available. Yet, there are two basic principles underlying them all: electric-field-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (En-TMS) and line-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (Ln-TMS). The current study was designed to compare both methods.
To explore whether there is a difference in clinical applicability, workflow, and mapping results of both techniques, we systematically compared motor mapping via En-TMS and Ln-TMS in 12 patients suffering from brain tumors.; The number of motor-positive stimulation spots and the ratio of positive spots per overall stimulation numbers were significantly higher for En-TMS (motor-positive spots: En-TMS vs. Ln-TMS: 128.3 +- 35.0 vs. 41.3 +- 26.8, p < 0.0001; ratio of motor-positive spots per number of stimulations: En-TMS vs. Ln-TMS: 38.0 +- 9.2 % vs. 20.0 +- 14.4 %, p = 0.0031). Distances between the En-TMS and Ln-TMS motor hotspots were 8.3 +- 4.4 mm on the ipsilesional and 8.6 +- 4.5 mm on the contralesional hemisphere (p = 0.9124).; The present study compares En-TMS and Ln-TMS motor mapping in the neurosurgical context for the first time. Although both TMS systems tested in the present study are explicitly designed for application during motor mapping in patients with brain lesions, there are differences in applicability, workflow, and results between En-TMS and Ln-TMS, which should be distinctly considered during clinical use of the technique. However, to draw final conclusions about accuracy, confirmation of motor-positive Ln-TMS spots by intraoperative stimulation is crucial within the scope of upcoming investigations.

N2  -  Neurodegeneration of the striatum in Huntington disease (HD) is characterized by loss of medium-spiny neurons, huntingtin nuclear inclusions, reactive gliosis, and iron accumulation. Neuroimaging allows in vivo detection of the macro- and micro-structural changes that occur from presymptomatic stages of the disease (preHD). The aim of our study was to evaluate the reliability of multimodal imaging as an in vivo biomarker of vulnerability and development of the disease and to characterize macro- and micro-structural changes in subcortical nuclei in HD. Macrostructure (T1-weighted images), microstructure (diffusion tensor imaging), and iron content (R2* relaxometry) of subcortical nuclei and medial temporal lobe structures were evaluated by a 3 T scanner in 17 preHD carriers, 12 early-stage patients and 29 matched controls. We observed a volume reduction and microstructural changes in the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus) and iron accumulation in the globus pallidus in both preHD and symptomatic subjects; all these features were significantly more pronounced in patients, in whom degeneration extended to the other subcortical nuclei (i.e., thalamus and accumbens). Mean diffusivity (MD) was the most powerful predictor in models explaining more than 50% of the variability in HD development in the caudate, putamen, and thalamus. These findings suggest that the measurement of MD may further enhance the well-known predictive value of striatal volume to assess disease progression as it is highly sensitive to tissue microimpairment. Multimodal imaging may detect brain changes even in preHD stages. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
